University of Alabama","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Byrne","Bradley Byrne","Republican","Alabama Senate","Episcopalian","Bradley Byrne (born February 16, 1955) is a business attorney and Republican congressman for Alabama's 1st congressional district. He served as chancellor of the Alabama Community College System from 2007 until his resignation in 2009 to run for the 2010 Republican nomination for Governor of Alabama.[1][2] He was also a member of the Alabama State Senate from 2003 to 2007. He holds a degree from Duke University, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, he also attended the University of Alabama.[3] In December 2013, he won a special election to represent Alabama's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.


Byrne's first run for elective office was in 1994 was a success when he ran for the Alabama State Board of Education as a Democrat.[3][4] During his term on the State Board of Education, Byrne supported a science curriculum that was opposed by many religious leaders in Alabama. He later voted with the Board to support a compromise that said, ""Explanations of the origin of life and major groups of plants and animals, including humans, shall be treated as theory and not as fact. When attempting to apply scientific knowledge to world problems, no social agenda shall be promoted."" [5] In 1996 Byrne voted with the majority of Board members to reject $18 million in federal education funds because it was feared the money would allow greater federal control of schools. The vote was seen as a nod to the growing conservative influence in his south Alabama district.[5] However Byrne later changed his mind and convinced the Board to allow the money [6]
In 1997 Byrne left the Democratic party and became a Republican.[7]
In 2002 Byrne ran for an Alabama State Senate seat.[8] He won with 91% of the vote over his Democratic challenger.[9]
In May 2007, Byrne took the position of community college chancellor [10] and oversaw a controversial reordering of much of the system. Bishop State Community College in Mobile was the target of investigators who found both financial and academic issues at the school in 2006 and 2007. Byrne ordered an audit of the school which demonstrated many deficiencies. At the time, about 2 dozen people were charged with criminal fraud and theft charges. A total of 27 would be charged before the probe ended in May 2007 [10][11]
Byrne also worked with Alabama Attorney General Troy King to recover monies stolen from the community college system.[12]
During the campaign, he was accused by his opponents in the Republican primary of supporting evolution, to which he replied, ""As a Christian and as a public servant, I have never wavered in my belief that this world and everything in it is a masterpiece created by the hands of God ... As a member of the Alabama Board of Education, the record clearly shows that I fought to ensure the teaching of creationism in our school text books. Those who attack me have distorted, twisted and misrepresented my comments and are spewing utter lies to the people of this state."".[13] The incident was later mocked in one of Real Time with Bill Maher episodes.
Following the run-off, Byrne went back to practicing business law, joining the Jones Walker law firm on August 16, 2010.[27]
On February 23, 2011, Byrne announced he was partnering with other prominent Alabamians to create a nonprofit organization that would push for reforms in state government.[28] Named ""Reform Alabama"", the organization actively supported legislation in the 2011 Alabama Regular Legislative Session.[29]
A May 25, 2011 Mobile Press-Register article reported that Byrne was considering the possibility of running for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in the upcoming 2012 election. ""Ive been encouraged to look at it, and Im doing that. But Ive made no decision, and frankly Im no where near a decision at this point,"" Byrne said.[30]
On May 23, 2013, U.S. Representative Jo Bonner announced that he would resign, effective on August 15, 2013.[31] Byrne won the Republican primary and the November 5 runoff to become the nominee for the general election in December.
Byrne faced Dean Young in the runoff election who received the support of Tea Party voters. After the runoff, Young refused to endorse Byrne which led to rumors of a rift within the Republican Party. But Byrne subsequently gained the endorsement of Alabama Patriots, a Tea Party affiliated organization.[32] Byrne won the Republican nomination for the congressional seat and faced Democratic Party nominee Burton LeFlore on December 17, 2013.[33][34] Byrne won the election with 71% of the vote.[34]
Byrne was originally believed to be running for re-election unopposed, but Burton LeFlore, his Democratic opponent in the 2013 special election, managed to qualify.[35][36]
Byrne won re-election with 68% of the vote.[37]
Byrne supported the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason.[38] In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.[39] Byrne spoke out in favor of the bill saying, ""the Obama Administration has been open and honest about one thing in particular: they have no problem making an end-run around Congress to achieve through administrative means what they cannot legislatively. Placing political convenience above the United States Constitution goes against everything the Founding Fathers intended, and it's time we put a stop to this practice.""[40]
Byrne has sponsored two bills of his own:[41]"

Cumberland School of Law","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Roby","Martha Roby","Republican","Montgomery City Council","Presbyterian (PCA)","Martha Dubina Roby[1] (born July 26, 1976) is the U.S. Representative for Alabama's 2nd congressional district. She is a member of the Republican Party. She defeated incumbent Representative Bobby Bright on November 2 during the United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2010,[2] and assumed office in January 2011. Roby and Terri Sewell are the first women elected to Congress from Alabama in regular elections.[3]


Roby was born in Montgomery, Alabama and attended New York University, where she received a bachelor of music degree. She then entered the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, receiving her J.D. in 2001. She is the daughter of Joel F. Dubina, a Senior Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
Before entering politics, she worked at the law firm of Copeland, Franco.[4]
Roby was elected to the Montgomery City Council in 2003, defeating a total of five opponents, and winning 54.88% of the votes cast in her district.[5][6]
In her first term on the Council, Roby joined 3 other council members and then mayor Bobby Bright in opposing the building of a shopping mall in East Montgomery,[7] opposed privatizing the disposal of household garbage,[8] supported a 10 cent cigarette tax increase,[9] and argued for a state sales tax holiday.[10] She headed a committee focused on illegal immigration; the committee's goal was to create a law that revoked business licenses for companies that used illegal aliens.[11]
Roby challenged incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman and former Montgomery Mayor Bobby Bright in Alabama's 2nd congressional district. In the four-candidate Republican primary, Roby ranked first with 49% of the vote, barely missing the 50% threshold needed to win the nomination and avoid a run-off. Rick Barber ranked second with 29% of the vote.[12] In the run-off election, Roby defeated him 60%-40%.[13]
Roby was endorsed by both Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin in the most expensive race in the district's history.[14] Martha Roby spent a total of $1,240,275.64 on her 2010 election. Most of her funds came from large individual contributions. Her top contributor was Jim Wilson and Associates, a Montgomery real estate outfit, who contributed $25,300.00.[15] Roby's top industry contributor was leadership PAC's. They contributed a total of $106,010.[14]
Roby defeated Bright 51%-49%, a difference of 4,780 votes. Roby won just 7 of the district's 16 counties: Autauga, Elmore, Covington, Coffee, Geneva, Dale, and Houston counties. Bright won Montgomery County with 59% of the vote. Ultimately, Roby's margin in heavily Republican Autauga and Elmore counties proved too much for Bright to overcome.[16]
The 2nd had long been a conservative district, and reverted to form as Roby won a second term, defeating Democrat Therese Ford 64%-36%. She won 11 of the district's 15 counties. However, she lost her home county of Montgomery again, 53%-47%.[17][18]
Roby identifies herself as a staunch conservative,[19] who explained ""true conservative values"" thusly: ""I believe in the sanctity of life. I believe in the protection of the second amendment. I believe in small, limited government and lower taxes. I believe that we should live within our means and I believe in the central role of faith and family in our lives.""[20] Roby is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[21]
Regulation reform In December 2011, Roby voted in support of H.R. 10, the ""Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act,"" which would have required Congressional approval for any ""major regulations"" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.[22]
Immigration Roby is an opponent of ""amnesty"" policy for immigrants, and said in a 2010 debate, ""I will never support any legislation with the word 'amnesty' in it.""[23]
Abortion Roby voted ""yea"" for bill HR 358 and HR 3, both bills prohibiting taxpayer money from paying for individual abortions.[24] Representative Roby introduced HConRes36, whose purpose was to stop tax payer subsidies from going to Planned Parenthood which is a multi-million dollar private corporation. Roby believes ""The more taxpayer dollars awarded to Planned Parenthood, the more abortions the group will perform"".[25]
Agriculture Roby is a member of the subcommittee for agriculture, energy, and forestry, and believes that federal agencies need to be ""reign[ed] in"".[26] She believes that the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) should be limited.[27] Roby believes CRP is causing a loss of farming production. She has also stated that CRP is no longer helping the environment.[28] She also has spoken out against many of the Environmental Protection Agency actions, specifically the MACT ruling.[29]
Health care reform Roby is against government paid-for or sponsored healthcare. She has repeatedly voted to repeal the health care bill also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act[30] She also voted for the Ryan Budget Bill, which would change medicare into a voucher system.[31]
Defense Representative Roby has consistently voted to prevent any defense spending cuts. She has also voted against a reduction in Navy and Aircraft Procurement[32] as well as voting ""yea"" for various extension of the armed forces budgets. She has only focused on cutting ""non-defense"" spending.[33]
War in Afghanistan Roby voted ""Nay"" to remove American forces from Afghanistan by December 31, 2011.[34]
Food stamps Roby voted in September 2013 to cut $39 billion from the food stamp program; the Montgomery Advertiser noted that ""About 41,000 households in Roby's southeastern congressional district received food stamps in 2011"".[35]
Taxes In 2010 Roby signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity to not vote for any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[36]
Roby has sponsored six bills of her own, including:[37]"

Birmingham School of Law","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Alabama_politician)","Mike Rogers","Republican","Calhoun County Commissioner, Alabama House of Representatives","Baptist - IFB","Michael Dennis ""Mike"" Rogers (born July 16, 1958), is the U.S. Representative for Alabama's 3rd congressional district, serving since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party.


A fifth generation resident of Calhoun County in East Alabama, Rogers graduated from Saks High School and earned both his undergraduate degree in Political Science and Masters of Public Administration at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Alabama.[citation needed]
At 28 years old, Rogers became the youngest person and first Republican to join the Calhoun County Commission.[citation needed] While serving on the Commission and working for the United Way, Rogers enrolled at the Birmingham School of Law along with his wife, Beth, and upon graduating with honors began a general law practice in Anniston.[citation needed] Three years later he started his own firm, which grew to become Anniston's largest.[citation needed]
In 1994 he won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives, and became Minority leader in his second term. In 2002, Bob Riley successfully ran for governor, leaving the 3rd district vacant. Rogers easily won the Republican nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley in the congressional election in 1998.[1]
Except on spending, where he earned the dubious title of ""April 2012 Porker of the Month"" [2] and only a 23% rating from Citizens Against Government Waste [3] Rogers has a conservative voting record[according to whom?]. He dissented with the Morocco free trade agreement due to potential job losses in the Alabama textile industry.[citation needed] On social issues Rogers has voted in opposition to abortion, gay marriage and immigration.[citation needed] However, he has acted to protect the Armed Services industry in his area.[citation needed] On the Armed Services Committee, he opposed a new series of military base closures and won passage of a bill that would assure that universities would provide access to their facilities for military recruitment purposes and ROTC.[citation needed] Despite this, in 2008, he received a rating of 50% from the American Conservative Union, one of the most moderate voting records of a Southern Republican for that year.[4]
Rogers was a recipient of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's ARMPAC campaign contributions.[citation needed] DeLay was prosecuted and convicted on charges of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. To date, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received.[5] Rogers said that DeLay is innocent until proven guilty, and that he would not return the money ""while the judicial process runs its course.""[6]
After the Democratic Party took control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections, Rogers joined many relatively junior Republican members of the House in seeing their perceived influence diminish. Knowlegis, a nonpartisan lobbying information firm, dropped Rogers from being ranked as the 138th most influential Representative to being 402nd in that category.[7]
Rogers is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[8]
In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the ""Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act,"" which would have required Congressional approval for any ""major regulations"" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.[9][10]
Rogers supported an amendment to declare that people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools. He cosponsored legislation to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Rogers sponsored a bill expressing the continued support of Congress for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education.[11] He also introduced legislation making it illegal to satirize or in any way parody the Transportation Security Administration.[12]
In a very close election, the Turnham-Rogers contest was one of the most closely watched in 2002. Both Democratic and Republican National parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services committee should he win. Rogers heavily outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290[13] to Turnham's $1,015,132,[14] with Rogers enjoying an even greater margin in independent expenditures. Rogers narrowly won the election by a 50%-48% margin.[15] In this election, Rogers became a rare Republican endorsee of The Anniston Star.[16]
Rogers and his wife have three children. They reside in Saks and are members of a Baptist Church.[citation needed]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes most of Tuscaloosa, as well as the far northern suburbs of Birmingham and the southern suburbs of Huntsville and Decatur.
Aderholt is a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus and has taken conservative stands on issues such as abortion, tax reform, defense spending, and same sex marriage.[2]


Aderholt was born in Haleyville, Alabama, to Mary Frances Brown and Bobby Ray Aderholt.[3] Aderholt's father, a part-time minister for a small group of Congregational churches in northwest Alabama, was a circuit judge for more than 30 years. He attended the University of North Alabama and then Birmingham-Southern College from which he graduated. During college, Aderholt was a member of Kappa Alpha Order. Aderholt received his J.D. from the Samford University Cumberland School of Law and practiced law after graduation.
In 1992, Aderholt was appointed Haleyville municipal judge. In the same year, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1995, he became the top aide to Governor Fob James. He won the 1996 Republican primary in the race to succeed 15-term Democratic incumbent Tom Bevill.
Aderholt is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[4] saying he will not raise taxes on any tax bracket.[citation needed]
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the ""Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act,"" which would have required congressional approval for any ""major regulations"" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.[5][6]
During the March for Life rally in Washington on Jan 22, 2010, he said, The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue.[citation needed]
Aderholt is opposed to same-sex marriage. He has received high ratings from the Family Research Council, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the American Family Association.[7] In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.[8]
He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the American deficit, and in May 2012 said ""cuts to defense budgets - the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility - shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending"".[9] Aderholt opposes government spending to stimulate economic growth. He voted against the $787 Billion Stimulus Package in February 2009.[citation needed]
Aderholt is a supporter of the Second Amendment. He was endorsed by the NRA in the 2010 general election,[10] and received $2000 from them.[11]
During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)[Notes 1] which would ""require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval. Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass.""[12] Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which stated, ""I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry.""[13] Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an ""unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate"" that would result in a loss of American jobs. He agreed with the global warming petition project[14] that, ""[t]here is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing, or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earths atmosphere and disruption of the Earths climate.""[15]
Aderholt's voting record is generally conservative. However, his votes on economic issues have been generally based on the concerns of his district rather than an overarching ideology.[citation needed] He has been notable in his support of quotas on steel imports and sponsored a bill assessing additional anti-dumping duties on foreign steel in 1999. He voted against the free trade agreements with Chile, Morocco, and Singapore, but supported the US-Australia FTA. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Aderholt has secured a significant amount of highway and sewer funding for the 4th District. Aderholt voted in favor of a joint resolution to withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2000 and 2005.[16][17] He is involved with the NASA Space Launch System and has urged to increase funding for the programs based in Alabama.[7]
Aderholt is a supporter of Roy Moore.[citation needed]
Aderholt voted in favor of the Central America Free Trade Agreement, but has since stated that he relied on promises by the Bush White House that were not kept.[citation needed]
On November 4, 1999, Aderholt voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,[18] which some economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, believe helped create the 2007 financial crisis.[19][20]

As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat ""in the Tom Bevill tradition"". This was a seriously contested race, receiving a deal of national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. Newt Gingrich personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won narrowly, 50%-48%, and hasn't faced serious opposition since.
Aderholt was re-elected unopposed.[citation needed]
Aderholt was reelected in the November election where he beat State representative Daniel Boman, the Democratic nominee.[22] In 2012 Aderholt raised $1,207,484.98 for his campaign, but spent only $963,859.15. Parker Towing was his largest contributor, providing $24,000.00. $493,856, 41% of his contributions came from large individual contributions. $583,000, 48% came from PACs.[7]

Brooks has been endorsed by Americans for Legal Immigration (ALI),[45] a political action committee (or PAC).
Brooks has co-sponsored 14 immigration-reducing bills since taking office in January 2011.[47] Brooks also has stated that he feels Congress will probably do nothing about illegal immigration in the coming years.[33]
On June 29, 2011, in an interview with reporter Venton Blandin of WHNT-TV, Brooks was asked by Blandin to repeat what he had previously stated at a town hall meeting about illegal immigrants. Brooks repeated his previous statement, saying, ""As your congressman on the House floor, I will do anything short of shooting them. Anything that is lawful, it needs to be done because illegal aliens need to quit taking jobs from American citizens."" [48]
In a radio interview with the Will Anderson Radio Show, Brooks stated his opposition to undocumented immigrants serving in the military, saying, These individuals have to be absolutely 100 percent loyal and trustworthy, as best as we can make them, cause theyre gonna have access to all sorts of military weaponry  even to the point of having access to weapons of mass destruction like our nuclear arsenal. And Im gonna have much greater faith in the loyalty of an American citizen than a person who is a citizen of a foreign nation.[49]
On August 4, 2014 Brooks went on The Laura Ingraham Show and Ingraham played Brooks a clip of Ron Fournier warning that the Republican Party could not survive as the ""party of white people."" Brooks responded: ""Well, this is a part of the war on whites thats being launched by the Democratic Party... And the way in which theyre launching this war is by claiming that whites hate everybody else. It's part of the strategy that Barack Obama implemented in 2008, continued in 2012, where he divides us all on race, on sex, creed, envy, class warfare, all those kinds of things."" The comment drew considerable comments and controversy.[50][51] For example, The New Yorker stated: ""White reactionaries in the 19th century imagined that abolishing slavery would turn white people themselves into slaves, and the concept of white subjugation was transferred into such things as black suffrage, civil rights, and so on. The war on whites has raged continuously in the right-wing mind for more than two centuries.""[52] When asked about the comment later that day, Brooks repeated the claim of a war on whites, stating: ""In effect, what the Democrats are doing with their dividing America by race is they are waging a war on whites and I find that repugnant""[53]
Two days after the original comment, Brooks expanded also stated that the Republican Party was involved in a war on whites.[54]
Brooks supports the right for the NSA to collect telephone metadata on Americans, saying its potential to thwart terrorist attacks outweighs potential infringements on privacy.[55] However, in 2014, Brooks voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act,[56] which, according to the bill's sponsor, would ""rein in the dragnet collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other government agencies, increase transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), provide businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA requests, and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue cases before the FISC.""[57]
In December 2011, Brooks voted in support of H.R. 10, the ""Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny Act,"" which would have required Congressional approval for any ""major regulations"" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.[58][59]
Brooks said Birmingham, a city where Alabama's strict immigration law has been criticized, needed to prepare to spend more money if it wants to be a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. He told Blandin, ""They need to start picking up the tab that American citizens are having to pick up. If Birmingham wants to be a sanctuary city, or wants to head in that direction, that is their decision. They are absolutely wrong.""[48]
In April 2011, Brooks stated, during a congressional speech, ""Folks, we are here today forcing this issue because America is at risk. We are at risk of insolvency and bankruptcy because the socialist members of this body choose to spend money that we do not have."" After Brooks made this remark, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison asked that Brooks' comments be ""taken down."" This request forced Brooks to either have the comment stricken from the record or defend the remark and wait until later in the day for a formal ruling over whether or not the comment was inappropriate. Brooks chose to have the remark withdrawn before he continued with his speech. Ellison accepted the withdrawal.[60]
Afterwards, Brooks stated that he did not regret his initial remark and that he thought those who objected to his comment, particularly those within the Democratic Party, were ""thin-skinned.""[60] He stated, ""People could quite clearly infer that socialism is what the other guys are promoting.""[60]
Brooks voted yes on terminating funding for NPR.[61][62][63]
Brooks met Martha Jenkins of Toledo, Ohio, at Duke University. They were married in 1976. Martha graduated from the University of Alabama with a degree in accounting. In 2004, Martha attended the University of Alabama in Huntsville for a degree in teaching and currently teaches math at Whitesburg Middle School in Huntsville.[65] They have four children, three granddaughters, and two grandsons.[8] Brooks joined the LDS Church in 1978, and though he still attends Mormon services with his wife, he considers himself a non-denominational Christian.[66]"

Alabama's 7th congressional district includes most of the Black Belt, as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham and Tuscaloosa.
Sewell is a member of the Democratic Party and the first black woman elected to Congress from Alabama.[3] Sewell is the only Democrat in Alabama's seven-member congressional delegation. Sewell and Martha Roby are the first women elected to Congress from Alabama in regular elections.[4]
A native of Selma, Sewell is a graduate of Princeton University, Harvard Law School and Oxford University. She is a public finance attorney.


Sewell was raised in Selma. She is the daughter of Andrew A. Sewell, a former athletic coach, and Nancy Gardner Sewell, a former City Councilwoman and retired librarian of Selma. Her mother was the first black woman elected to the Selma City Council.[citation needed] Both parents held careers in the Selma public school system.
Terrycina Sewell became the first black valedictorian of Selma High School. Her mother's family had offered its homestead to travelers coming for the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. Sewell spent her childhood summers in Lowndes County, Alabama with her maternal grandparents. Her grandfather, a Primitive Baptist minister and a farmer, instilled in her a love for the land, an appreciation of hard work, and the importance of her faith. Her grandfather and the members of Beulah Primitive Baptist Church gave her a deep understanding of the Black Belt Region of Alabama and its people.
Sewell graduated with honors from Princeton University and received a scholarship from U.S. News and World Report, among others. A lifelong Democrat, during the summers while in college, she worked on Capitol Hill for 7th congressional district congressman Richard Shelby, as well as for Senator Howell Heflin. She was a leader on the college campus, serving in various roles including class vice-president, class representative to the Student Union, and spearheading the admission offices effort to set up a Minority Student Recruitment office to recruit more minority students to attend the university.[5]
Upon graduation from college, Sewell was featured on NBCs Today Show as one of the Top Collegian Women. She was chosen as one of the Top Ten College Women in America by Glamour Magazine. She received the Afro-American Studies Thesis Prize for her senior thesis, Black Women in Politics: Our Time Has Come, which featured a personal interview with Shirley Chisholm, the first black U.S. Congresswoman.[6] Sewell continued her education, receiving a Masters degree with first-class Honours from Oxford University. At the age of 25, she published her Masters thesis on the election of the first black members of British parliament as a book titled, Black Tribunes: Race and Representation in British Politics.[7]
Sewell attended Harvard Law School with the help of an NAACP Legal Defense Fund scholarship, graduating in 1992. In law school, she served as an editor of the Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review.[8] She published an article titled Selma, Lord, Selma, about the legal struggles in Selma, in the Harvard Black Letter Journal (vol. 8, Spring 1991).
After graduation, Sewell served as a judicial law clerk in Birmingham, Alabama to the Chief Judge U. W. Clemon,[9] United States District Court (AL-ND), who was the first black federal judge appointed in Alabama.
Sewell began her legal career in 1994 at the Wall Street law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. A securities lawyer for more than a decade, she gained experience in finance and the capital markets. Sewell provided free legal services to the homeless, mentoring girls of color in NYC high schools through the program Dreams into Action and serving on the Alumni Advisory Board of Sponsors of Educational Opportunity (SEO), a not-for-profit organization providing education, leadership training and Wall Street internships to students of color. Through her involvement with SEO, she served as the co-chair of the Community Assistance Fund, which provided $300,000,000 of aid and assistance to organizations serving communities of color affected by the events of September 11, 2001.
Sewell returned to Alabama in 2004 to assist her mother in the care of her father. As the first black female partner in the Birmingham law firm of Maynard, Cooper, & Gale, P.C., Sewell has distinguished herself as one of the only black public finance lawyers in the State of Alabama. She served as a lawyer helping to raise money for public projects for some of the states most underserved public entities, many in Alabama's 7th congressional district, including the City of Selma, Dallas County Water Authority, and Lowndes County Board of Education. Sewell made educational finance a particular focus of her practice, representing the historically black colleges in Alabama, including Alabama State University, Tuskegee University, and Stillman College, as well as other higher education institutions such as Wallace State-Hanceville, Jefferson State Community College, Chattahoochee Valley Community College, and the State of Alabamas Public Schools and University Authority.
After four-term Democratic incumbent Artur Davis gave up the seat to run for governor, Sewell entered the Democratic primarythe real contest in this majority Democratic, majority-black district. She finished first in the four-way primary with 36.8 percent of the vote.[10] In the runoff, she defeated Jefferson County commissioner Sheila Smoot with 55 percent of the vote.[11][12]
In the general election, Sewell trounced Republican challenger Don Chamberlain, taking 72.4 percent of the vote to become the first black woman elected to Congress from Alabama. The 7th is so strongly Democratic that Sewell essentially clinched her seat by winning the primary.[13]
Sewell was the only candidate to file for the Democratic nomination in 2012 and won the general election over Chamberlain as in 2010.[14][15]
Since being elected, Sewell has voted with her party 91% of the time, and she has been noted as a strong supporter of President Obama's policies.[16][17] Sewell has established herself as a loyal Democrat and liberal with a focus on job creation.[18] Sewell is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Sewell supported President Obama's plan to extend tax cuts for low- and middle-income Americans, but declined to discuss her stance on taxation for high-income Americans.[16] In response to Obama's Framework for Business Tax Reform, Sewell said: ""I applaud the President for outlining a bold framework for reforming the U.S. business tax system.""[19]
In 2012 Terri Sewell criticized Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's tax returns and effective tax rates, saying "" It should be about shared responsibility. I think that something is fundamentally wrong if a person of his great wealth is only paying 13.9 percent effective tax rate and most of Americans are paying 28, 30 percent and they make far less.[20]
Sewell supported Obama's decisions regarding Afghanistan, citing ""trust"" for his policies.[16] She was part of a bi-partisan delegation to accompany Nancy Pelosi on a 2-day trip to Afghanistan in May 2012. While there, they spent time ""with American service-members and meeting local officials to discuss security and womens issues.""[21]
Sewell has sponsored five bills:[22]
Terri Sewell served as co-chair of the Womens Fund Voices Against Violence inaugural campaign, which promoted women helping women to overcome domestic violence. The campaign raised more than $70,000 in four months to fight domestic violence in Birmingham, providing funds to establish the first Domestic Violence Court in Birmingham Municipal Court.[23] Sewell led the effort to have Teach for America select Alabamas Black Belt region as a new site in 2010.

He is a member of the Republican Party.
Young is the dean of the Alaskan congressional delegation, the third most senior U.S. Representative and the most senior Republican Representative. Young started his his political career as a mayor in 1964, then as a rep. in the Alaska House of Representatives, then served in the Alaska Senate.


Young was born in Meridian, Sutter County, California. He earned an associate's degree in education from Yuba College in 1952 and a bachelor's degree from Chico State College in 1958. He served in the Army from 1955 to 1957.[1]
Young moved to Alaska in 1959, not long after it became a state. He eventually settled in Fort Yukon, a 700-person city on the Yukon River, seven miles (11km) above the Arctic Circle in Alaskas central interior region. He made a living in construction, fishing, trapping and gold mining. He captained a tugboat and ran a barge operation to deliver products and supplies to villages along the Yukon River. He still holds his mariner's license. During the winter, he taught fifth grade at the local Bureau of Indian Affairs elementary school.
Young began his political career in 1964 when he was elected mayor of Fort Yukon. After only one term, he was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives and served two terms before being elected to the Alaska Senate in 1970.
Alaska's at-large congressman, Democrat Nick Begich, disappeared in a plane crash on October 16, 1972; he was reelected to the House that November, but was declared dead on December 29. Young, who had been the Republican candidate against Begich in November, ran in the special election in March 1973 and won with 51% of the vote against Democrat Emil Notti. He won a full term in 1974 with 54% of the vote. He credits his victory to his leadership of the fight for the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System.[2]
He won reelection with at least 55% of vote all but three other times in his career (1990, 1992, and 2008). In 1982 and 1984, he defeated Nick Begich's wife, Pegge Begich, with 55% and 57% respectively. In 1990 he won reelection with 52% against John Devens, the Mayor of Valdez. In 1992, he defeated Devens again, this time with 47%: the lowest winning percentage of his career and the only time he won without a majority vote. Young's largest winning percentage was in 2002 (75%), and the most votes he got was in 2004 (213,216).
In light of many of the controversies, incumbent Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell announced he would run against Young in the August 26, 2008 Republican primary. Parnell was strongly supported by Gov. Sarah Palin, the Club for Growth, and many other organizations that opposed what they viewed to be corrupt behavior by Young. This was the first primary since he was first elected in which Young faced a strong challenge.
Young received the endorsement of Mike Huckabee's political action committee, Huck PAC, in June 2008.[3] After a storm of negative reaction, Huckabee explained on the Huck PAC blog that the endorsement was due in part to Young's endorsement and steadfast support of Huckabee during the 2008 Republican presidential primaries.[4]
Final results on September 18 showed Young winning by 304 votes (0.28%), and Parnell announced that he would not seek a recount.[5] Prior to the announcement of the unofficial results, both candidates had said that they would request a recount if they lost.[6] The state of Alaska pays the costs of recounts when the difference is within a half percent, as it was in this primary election.[7]
Young faced a strong challenge from Democrat Ethan Berkowitz, the 46-year-old former minority leader in the Alaska House of Representatives. Don Wright, the Alaskan Independence Party nominee, also challenged Young.
He won reelection with 50% of the vote, compared to Berkowitz's 45% and Wright's 5%.[8][9] Berkowitz conceded defeat on November 18, 2008.[10]
Young announced in 2009 that he will be seeking his 20th term.[11] Young won the Republican primary with 70% of the vote against Sheldon Fisher and John R. Cox.[12] He was challenged by Democratic nominee State Representative Harry Crawford.[13] Young defeated him with 69% of the vote.[14]
Young drew two challengers in the Republican party, but easily defeated them. He won the primary with 79% of the vote.[15][16] In November, he won reelection to his 21st term, defeating State Representative Sharon Cissna, the Democratic nominee, 64%-29%.[17]
Young received 74% of the vote in the June 3 primary against three challengers.[18] In the November 4 general election, he defeated Democratic challenger Forrest Dunbar by a margin of 10%, with 50% to Dunbar's 40%, winning re-election to his 22nd term.[19] Young was the only statewide incumbent in Alaska to win re-election that year, as Republican Governor Sean Parnell was defeated by Independent Bill Walker, and Democratic Senator Mark Begich was defeated by Republican Dan Sullivan.
As of October 18, 2013, Young is the fourth longest-serving House member, and the most-senior Republican. Due to his long tenure in the House and that of former Senator Ted Stevens, Alaska is considered to have clout in national politics far beyond its small population (it has long been one of the smallest states in population and is currently 47th, ahead of only North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming). He is often called ""Alaska's third senator.""[20] Young chaired the Committee on Natural Resources from the 1995 Republican takeover of the House until 2001. He then chaired the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure from 2001 to 2007. He is currently the second-highest ranking Republican on both committees.
Young's voting record is relatively moderate by Republican standards. He has a lifetime rating of 77 from the American Conservative Union.[21] He most often crosses lines on issues affecting labor. He was one of a small number of Republicans to vote against the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995, some free trade agreements, and was one of only 13 Republican congressmen to vote for the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007. His voting record is anti-abortion and anti-gun control, but he was also among the Republicans to vote in favor of more federal funds for stem cell research and voted against the re-authorization of the Patriot Act. He is known for his opposition to federal control of Alaska's land and resources.[2] He is also a strong proponent of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.[22]
During a 1994 House debate touching on the question of Alaska Natives' right to sell sex organs of endangered animals for the purpose of aphrodisiacs, he pulled out an eighteen-inch penis bone of a walrus, better known as an Oosik. He brandished it like a sword on the House floor at the face of the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[20][23][24]
At a high school assembly in 2004, Young was answering questions about cutting federal funding for the arts. He said that such funding had ""photographs of people doing offensive things,"" and ""things that are absolutely ridiculous."" When asked for an example, Young quickly replied ""buttfucking"", in reference to Robert Mapplethorpe's photographic exhibition The Perfect Moment.[25][26]
On November 4, 1999, Young voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,[27] which some economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, believe helped create the 2007 financial crisis.[28][29]
In 2000, when evidence surfaced that the Pittman-Robertson Act conservation trust funds were being mismanaged, Young introduced the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act. The bill passed the House 423-2 and became law on Nov. 1, 2000 and defines in what manner the monies can be spent.
In the wake of September 11, 2001, Young sponsored the Airport Security Federalization Act of 2001, which created the Transportation Security Administration.[30]
In July 2007, fellow Republican Congressman Scott Garrett of New Jersey proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native Alaskan and Hawaiian educational programs.[31] Young defended the funds on the floor of the House, stating that ""You want my money, my money.""[31] Young also stated that ""Those who bite me will be bitten back.""[31] Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending earmarks, and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.[31] While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the conservative Republican Study Committee gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina compared Young's earmarks to ""legal theft.""[31]
Although Congressman Young is considered to be Pro-Life and was quoted saying, "" I have always voted for pro-life legislation as I believe an unborn child is a human being and should be protected through all stages of life,"" (1997)[32] his official positions on the subject do not make abortion illegal in every scenario. Young believes that abortion should be legal only when the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape, or in the case that a womans life is endangered by her pregnancy. He has addressed the issue of the time-period in which abortions should be legal, saying he does not think abortions should be limited to the first trimester of a pregnancy, and also disagrees with the idea of federal subsidies prohibiting abortions.[33]
Young is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[34]
According to The New Republic, Young is ""well-known for his sharp elbows and generous appetite for legislative pork.""[35] His reputation for steering federal dollars to Alaska is almost as legendary as that of Ted Stevens. For example, in the 2005 Highway Bill, Young helped secure $941 million for 119 ""special projects,"" including a $231 million bridge in Anchorage that a rider in the bill named for Young himself.[36]
Young introduced the Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act (H.R. 3110; 113th Congress) on September 17, 2013. The bill would authorize the Hoonah Indian Association to harvest glaucous-winged gull eggs from Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska twice a year from up to five locations.[37] Young said that ""passage of this legislation is an important step for upholding the traditional way of life for Alaska's First People.""[38] Young also said that ""its a shame that even after Congress amended the Migratory Bird Act in 1995 to allow for customary and traditional use of migratory birds by indigenous inhabitants of Alaska, gull egg harvests remained prohibited under National Park Service regulation.""[38]
Young introduced the To amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to exempt certain Alaskan Native articles from prohibitions against sale of items containing nonedible migratory bird parts (H.R. 3109; 113th Congress) into the House on September 17, 2013. The bill would allow Alaskan Natives to make and sell traditional handicrafts such as masks, jewelry, clothing, and hunting equipment that are made from parts of migratory birds, particularly feathers.[39] The bill passed the House in a voice vote on September 8, 2014.[40]
Young introduced the bill H.R. 3786 on December 16, 2013.[41] The bill would allow the federal government to sell nine acres of land and the building on it to the city of Anchorage, Alaska.[42] The land is currently owned and used by the National Archives and Records Administration to store ""ongoing federal records and Alaska records dating back to its purchase in 1867.""[43]
In 2005, Young and Stevens earmarked $223 million for building the enormous Gravina Island Bridge from Ketchikan to Gravina Island, which also contains Ketchikan's airport. The bridge would be used for access by emergency vehicles, as well as passengers. Currently there is a small car and passenger ferry that travels the 1/4 mile (400 m) crossing in 3 to 7 minutes and runs every half hour. Critics assailed this as pork barrel spending at taxpayers' expense and dubbed it the ""Bridge to Nowhere."" The Gravinia Island Bridge was awarded a Golden Fleece by the federal budget watchdog organization Taxpayers for Common Sense in 2003.[44] After criticism from citizens and others in Congress, lawmakers de-funded the bridge and instead funneled the money to Alaska's Department of Transportation, allowing the Governor of Alaska to start road construction after the Alaska Legislature funded the project with the directed monies.[45]
Another bridge earmarked in the bill connects Anchorage to Pt. Mackenzie, a lightly populated area in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough that is situated less than four miles (6km) across Cook Inlet from downtown Anchorage.[46]
Currently, Anchorage is accessible from Point Mackenzie only by an 80-mile (130km) route around Knik Arm, much of which is an unimproved road. The demise of this second bridge project has been suggested for years.[47]
Part of the concern for the Bridge is that if it were built, it would significantly enhance the value of property in which Mr. Young's son-in-law owns an interest.[20][48][49]
He was listed as the third-worst congressman by the popular magazine Rolling Stone, and dubbed ""Mr. Pork"" due to his involvement in the Gravina Island ""Bridge to Nowhere"" incident.[20] In the article, Young is quoted as saying that ""Environmentalists are a self-centered bunch of waffle-stomping, Harvard-graduating, intellectual idiots"" who ""are not Americans, never have been Americans, never will be Americans.""[20]
On July 24, 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Young was under federal investigation for possibly taking bribes, illegal gratuities or unreported gifts from VECO Corporation, an Anchorage-based company. The top two executives of that company had already pleaded guilty to bribing members of the Alaska legislature.[50] The Journal said a VECO executive held fundraisers called ""the Pig Roast"" for Young every August for ten years. Between 1996 and 2006, Young received $157,000 from VECO employees and its political action committee. In the first half of 2007, Young spent more than $250,000 of his campaign contributions for legal fees.[31]
A confession signed by Bill Allen, the former chief of VECO, was released in October 2009. Allen agreed that from 1993 to August 2006, both he and his deputy at VECO, Rick Smith, ""provided things of value to United States Representative A,"" a reference to Young. For example, in June 2006, Smith obtained a set of golf clubs, costing approximately $1,000, that Smith gave to Young. Although Young was obligated in 2006 to report gifts with a value of more than $335, he didn't report receiving any gifts on the personal financial disclosure form he filed with the House of Representatives for that year.[51]
In August 2010, the investigation launched by the FBI was closed. The office noted that the evidentiary findings of their investigation were being forwarded to the Ethics Commission. The Ethics Committee made no official findings.
In March 2013, the House Ethics Committee created another special committee to investigate more allegations that Young improperly accepted gifts, used campaign funds for personal expenses, failed to report gifts in financial disclosure documents, and made false statements to federal officials.[52] On future predictions, Young stated ""it will go forever. I've been under a cloud all my life. I'm sort of like living in Juneau. It rains on you all the time. You don't even notice it.""[53]
The Ethics Committee is now forming a sub-committee charged with the duty of determining whether or not Young broke the law. There is no timeline for either the sub-committee, or the Ethics Committee, to release its findings.
Congressman Young was included in the annual listing of the most corrupt members of Congress compiled by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in reports on Congressional corruption. CREW said he had been investigated for a 2005 earmark which benefitted a campaign donor, and for using campaign funds for personal expenses. No charges have been brought at any time for any criminal wrongdoing after investigations by the FBI.[54][55] The House Ethics Committee found he had improperly used campaign funds for personal expenses.[56]
In late 2010, Obama administration officials stated that the Deepwater Horizon blowout exceeded the Exxon Valdez spill, as they estimated that the gusher had spewed between 15million US gallons (57,000m3) and 40million US gallons (150,000m3) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Young said that the oil pumping into the Gulf was not an ""environmental disaster"", stating that it was a ""natural phenomena"" as ""oil has seeped into this ocean for centuries, will continue to do it. During World War II there was over 10,000,000 barrels (1,600,000m3) of oil spilt from ships, and no natural catastrophe. We will lose some birds, we will lose some fixed sealife, but overall it will recover.""[57]
The Arctic Refuge drilling controversy has repeatedly brought Don Young into the national spotlight. Young has been a longstanding supporter of opening lands within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. He has included provisions to that effect in 12 bills that have passed the House of Representatives,[58] but environmentalists concerned with the impact of road-building, pipelines and other development on the Arctic tundra landscape have thus far successfully defeated such legislation in the Senate.[59]
On November 18, 2011, Young got into an argument during a Congressional hearing with Douglas Brinkley, a historian who teaches at Rice University in Texas, over the idea of drilling in ANWR. During Brinkleys testimony Young was not present in the room,[60] yet still to responded to the speech Brinkley had made. Young himself commented that his absence during Brinkley's testimony was attributable to a pre-scheduled vote on the House floor. Young not only referred to Brinkleys argument as garbage, but also addressed Brinkley as Mr. Rice, (rather than Dr. Brinkley).[61] Brinkley responded with remarks about Young's own education, stating, ""I know you went to Yuba College and couldn't graduate."" Young reaction, Ill say anything I want to say! You just be quiet!, was met with Brinkley's refusal, and response that Young, ""didn't own [him]"" and quipping that as a taxpayer, he pays Young's salary. The two continued arguing intermittently throughout the hearing, with the committee chairman ultimately threatening Brinkley with removal.[62][63]
On March 28, 2013, Young caused some controversy when he used the ethnic slur ""wetbacks"" during a radio interview to describe Latino migrant farm workers who worked at his father's ranch when he was growing up.[64] Young issued a statement later that day saying that he ""meant no disrespect"" and that he ""used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in central California"".[65] The Associated Press said that while Rep. Young explained his statement, he ""did not apologize.""[65] Prominent figures in the Republican Party, including House Speaker John Boehner and Senator John Cornyn, condemned the remarks as ""offensive"" and ""derogatory"".[66] On March 29, 2013, Latino advocacy group Presente.org called for Rep. Young's resignation in reaction to his use of the slur.[67] On March 29, 2013, Young issued a formal apology for his remarks, stating, ""I apologize for the insensitive term,"" and that ""it was a poor choice of words.""[68]
On October 21, 2014, Young addressed an assembly of students at Wasilla High School, shortly after a student there committed suicide. During a question and answer session, the congressman said that the student's suicide had been caused by a lack of support from family and friends. Young apologized for these comments on October 24, stating, ""I am profoundly and genuinely sorry for the pain it has caused the Alaskan people.""[69][70]
Young was married to the former Lula Fredson, an indigenous Gwich'in. She volunteered her time serving as the manager of her husband's Washington, D.C. congressional office. They had two daughters and were members of the Episcopal Church. Lula died on August 1, 2009 at the age of 67.[71]
On August 17, 2014, Young announced his engagement to Anne Garland Walton, a flight nurse.[72]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party. She earlier served in the Arizona House of Representatives. She was defeated by Republican Paul Gosar in the 2010 election. In 2012, she was again the Democratic nominee, and went on to win the general election to regain her old seat in a close race.[3]


Kirkpatrick was born and raised on an Apache Indian reservation near McNary, Arizona,[4] though she is not of Native American descent; her mother was a teacher and her father a general store owner. Her uncle, William Bourdon, was a member of the State House.[5] She graduated from Blue Ridge High School, the University of Arizona with an undergraduate degree in social studies in 1972, and the University of Arizona College of Law with a juris doctor in 1979.[6]
In 1980 she became Coconino Countys first woman deputy county attorney, and she later served as city attorney for Sedona. She was a member of the Flagstaff Water Commission. In 2004, she taught Business Law and Ethics at Coconino Community College.""[7]
Kirkpatrick has called for ""national, comprehensive reform"" of United States immigration policy. Kirkpatrick has said that she supports increased border patrol funding, installation of a ground-based radar system often referred to as a ""smart fence"", and a temporary-worker program and path to citizenship that would allow those already living in the United States illegally to earn legal status by learning English, holding a job and paying a fine.[8]
Kirkpatrick supports the DREAM Act, which would provide conditional permanent residency to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors and meet certain criteria.[9]
Kirkpatrick has stated that she would have voted against Arizona's controversial immigration measure Arizona SB 1070.[10]
In March 2014, Kirkpatrick signed a discharge petition intended to force House leaders to bring immigration reform up for a vote on the House floor.[11]
Kirkpatrick voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010.[12][13] In May 2013, she voted against repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[14]
She supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly referred to as the stimulus.[15][16] Kirkpatrick was the only Democrat to vote against a bill that would prevent a 0.5% pay increase for all federal workers from taking effect.[17]
Kirkpatrick has proposed seven bills regarding veterans, five of which have passed. Two such bills were H.R. 2879, which closed a loophole for terminally ill service members who want to collect their life insurance, and H.R. 3553, which removed disability payments as consideration of income under means-tested housing assistance.[18] Kirkpatrick voted against the Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which was designed to continue the operation of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefit Administration for 2014.[19]
She sponsored bill H.R. 4720, the Taking Responsibility for Congressional Pay Act, to lower the salaries of congressional members. The bill stalled in committee.[20]
Kirkpatrick supports same-sex marriage.[21]
Kirkpatrick characterizes herself as pro-choice.[9] She has been endorsed by EMILY's List, Planned Parenthood and the National Women's Political Caucus. As a member of the Arizona state legislature, Kirkpatrick voted against a bill that would have required notarized parental consent for a minor to receive an abortion.[22] She voted against a bill to ban abortions that would take place 20 or more weeks after fertilization.[23]
Kirkpatrick voted for CISPA, which would allow federal intelligence agencies to share cybersecurity intelligence and information with private entities and utilities.[24]
In 2004, Kirkpatrick was elected to represent the 1st Legislative District and took office in January 2005. Kirkpatrick was elected to a second term in the state House in 2006. While serving in the legislature, Kirkpatrick served as the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as the Education K-12 Committee and Natural Resources Committee.[7]
On July 24, 2007, Kirkpatrick resigned from the state House to run for the Democratic nomination in Arizona's 1st Congressional District. The seat was due to come open after three-term Republican incumbent Rick Renzi announced that he would not seek re-election in the face of a federal indictment on corruption charges. Kirkpatrick won a four-way primary by almost 15 points on September 2, 2008.
Kirkpatrick faced Republican Sydney Ann Hay, a mining industry lobbyist, in the general election, garnering 56 percent of the vote.[25]
Kirkpatrick was defeated for reelection by Republican nominee Paul Gosar. She was endorsed by The Arizona Republic.[26]
Kirkpatrick announced she would run again for her old congressional seat in 2012.[27] Redistricting made the district significantly more Democratic than its predecessor; Democrats now have a nine-point registration advantage. She was initially priming for a rematch against Gosar, but Gosar opted to run for reelection in the newly created, heavily Republican 4th District.[28] Kirkpatrick narrowly won the general election on November 6, 2012, defeating Republican former state Senator Jonathan Paton.[3] Kirkpatrick won the seat with less than 50% of the vote, while a Libertarian Party candidate took more than 6%.[29]
Kirkpatrick won re-election to the U.S. House in 2014. She faced no opposition in the Democratic primary.[30] According to a Washington Post article in December 2012, Kirkpatrick was one of the 10 most vulnerable incumbents in 2014.[31] Kirkpatrick is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline Program.

On March 14, 2014, Kirkpatrick cosponsored the Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress), a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill would make the RAC an independent organization within the VA, require that a majority of the RAC's members be appointed by Congress instead of the VA, and state that the RAC can release its reports without needing prior approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.[35][36] The RAC is responsible for investigating Gulf War syndrome, a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military veterans and civilian workers of the Gulf War.[35][37]
After losing her 2010 campaign, Kirkpatrick spent more than $100,000 on bonuses and vacation pay for her departing staff, more than all but two of the year's 93 retiring members.[38]

"9","","2015","1966","Arizona 2","United States Air Force Academy","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_McSally","Martha McSally","Republican","USAF Colonel","Pentecostal - AG","Martha McSally (born March 22, 1966) is a retired United States Air Force Colonel and politician who is currently a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives. She was the first American woman to fly in combat since the 1991 lifting of the prohibition of women in combat, flying the A-10 over Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Southern Watch.[1] She is the first woman to command a USAF fighter squadron, the 354th Fighter Squadron (354 FS) based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
After her military career, McSally ran for Congress in her home district three times. She ran in the April 2012 Republican primary for the special election in Arizona's 8th district, but lost to Jesse Kelly. Months later, she began the first of two races as the Republican candidate in the same district (renumbered as the 2nd district after redistricting), facing off against incumbent Democrat Ron Barber both times. In 2012, she narrowly lost.[2] But in 2014, following a recount, McSally was declared the winner on December 17, by a margin of 167 votes.[3]


McSally was born in 1966[4] in Warwick, Rhode Island, the youngest of five children. In 1978, her father, Bernard, a lawyer, died of a heart attack. Her mother, Eleanor, worked as a reading specialist to support the family.[5]
McSally graduated at the top of her class at St. Mary's Academy, Bayview in 1984.[5] She earned an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 1988.[5] She earned a Master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government following graduation from USAFA and then proceeded to pilot training.[6] McSally was first in her class at the Air War College.
McSally earned her wings following graduation from Undergraduate Pilot Training at Laughlin AFB, Texas and was initially assigned to Laughlin as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) in the T-37 jet trainer. Following the repeal of the combat aircraft restriction for female pilots, McSally became the first woman in U.S. history to fly a combat aircraft into enemy territory when she flew into Iraq in support of the United Nations no-fly zone enforcement.[5] She completed Lead-in Fighter Training (LIFT) in 1993.[7]
McSally completed Replacement Training Unit for the A-10 Thunderbolt II at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, and was assigned to an operational A-10 squadron and was deployed to Kuwait in January 1995.[1] During that deployment, she flew combat patrols over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.[1] In 1999, she deployed to Europe in support of Operation Allied Force. McSally was selected as one of seven active duty Air Force officers for the Legislative Fellowship program, during which time she lived in Washington, D.C. and advised John Kyl on defense and foreign affairs policy.[8]
Promoted to Major, she reported to Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2000 for an Operation Southern Watch temporary assignment. Promoted below the zone to Lieutenant Colonel, she took command of the A-10 equipped 354th Fighter Squadron at Davis-Monthan AFB in July 2004, and was subsequently deployed to Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom, where she employed weapons loaded on her A-10 in combat for the first time. In 2005, McSally and her squadron were awarded the David C. Shilling Award, given by the Air Force Association for the best aerospace contribution to national defense.[8]
McSally was represented by the Rutherford Institute in a successful 2001 lawsuit against the Department of Defense, challenging the military policy that required U.S. and U.K. servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear the body-covering abaya when traveling off base in the country.[9][10] At the time of the lawsuit McSally, as a Major (O-4), was the highest ranking female fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. Her suit alleged ""the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men.""[11] In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:
In a ""60 Minutes"" interview broadcast on CBS on January 20, 2002, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy: ""I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male ... [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife,"" she said. ""I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle.""[11]
During this process, she was granted audience with several high level officials, including two Secretaries of Defense, William Cohen and Donald Rumsfeld, which was atypical of a service member of her comparatively junior rank and position, especially in light of her public protest. General Tommy Franks, then commander of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be ""encouraged"" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman, Colonel Rick Thomas, said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been ""under review"" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply and wear the abaya.[12] Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for ""women diplomats"" of the U.S. Department of State assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, who were actually encouraged not to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, ""...because they are representing the United States."" Embassy officials stated that, ""...in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress."" According to these U.S. officials, ""...the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya.... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe.""[13]
Eventually the U.S. Congress ""approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers money to buy them.""[14]
McSally has continued to speak out about gender relations in Saudi Arabia.[15][16] McSally retired from active duty with 22 years of commissioned service in the U.S. Air Force on May 6, 2010. As of March 2011, she worked as a professor at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.[17]
On February 9, 2012, McSally announced her candidacy for the special election for Arizona's 8th congressional district vacancy created by the resignation of Gabrielle Giffords. She was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican nomination for the special election, losing to Republican nominee Jesse Kelly.[18]
McSally then ran for and won the Republican nomination in the regular election for the district, which had been renumbered as the 2nd District. She faced incumbent Democrat Ron Barber and Libertarian nominee Anthony Powell in the November 2012 election.[19] She was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, United States Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Wholesalers, of Commerce, National Association of Home Builders and Associated Builders and Contractors.[20]
The race was one of the closest in the nation. McSally led on election night by a few hundred votes, but the race was deemed too close to call due to a large number of provisional ballots. Barber eventually overtook McSally as more ballots were counted. By November 16, most of the outstanding ballots were in heavily Democratic precincts near Tucson. The Arizona Republic determined that as a result, McSally would not be able to pick up enough votes to overcome Barber's lead.[21] By November 17, Barber's lead over McSally had grown to 1,400 votes. That day, the Associated Press determined that there weren't enough ballots outstanding for McSally to regain the lead, and called the race for Barber.[22] She conceded the race later that morning.[21]
McSally declared her intention of running again for the 2nd district seat in 2014. She won the June 3 primary against 2 other Republican opponents, taking nearly 70% of the vote.[23] In the November 4 general election, the race was too close to call by the end of election night, and eventually went on to be the final federal election of the 2014 cycle to be decided. With 100% of the votes counted, McSally had a 161 vote lead and declared victory on November 12, 2014, but due to the fact that the margin of victory was less than 1%, an automatic recount was called on December 1.[24] On December 17, the official recount declared McSally the winner by 167 votes.[25] She is only the second Republican ever to represent a southern Arizona-based district in the U.S. House of Representatives; the first was Jim Kolbe, who represented what is now the 2nd district, from 1985 to 2007. McSally is also the first female Republican representative from Arizona.[26]
McSally has vowed to vote for repealing the Affordable Care Act.[27] She also supports local control of education, stating that, education for our kids should not be dictated by Washington bureaucrats but by local experts with parent involvement and rewards for excellence. Hard-earned middle-class-taxpayer money should not go to D.C. to strip funds off the top, then return to the states with conditions, paperwork and mandates resulting in cookie-cutter educational recipes.""[27][28]
McSally has stated her belief that women around the country are concerned with jobs, affordable healthcare, the future of social security, and education. She appeared on national television in October 2012 saying, ""You want to talk about a war on women? Walk in my shoes down the streets of Kabul. Walk in my shoes down the streets of Riyadh; where women have to be covered up. Where they're stoned, where theyre honor killed if theyve been raped, where they cant drive and they cant travel without the permission of a male relative. Thats a war on women.""[29]
McSally was married to Air Force officer Donald F. Henry from 1997 to 1999, before the marriage was annulled.[32] McSally is a triathlete.[5]"

Grijalva (/rul rhlv/; born February 19, 1948) is the U.S. Representative for Arizona's 3rd congressional district, serving since 2003. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 7th District from 2003 to 2013, includes the western third of Tucson, all of Yuma and Nogales, and some peripheral parts of metro Phoenix.


Ral M. Grijalva's father was a migrant worker from Mexico who entered the United States in 1945 through the Bracero Program and labored on southern Arizona ranches.[1] Grijalva was born in Tucson, Arizona, and graduated from Sunnyside High School in 1967. He is a 2004 inductee to the Sunnyside High School Alumni Hall of Fame. He attended the University of Arizona and earned a bachelor's degree in Sociology. While at the University, he was a member of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln (MEChA) which, at that time, was a radical group identified with the separatist Aztln  ideology. Grijalva also served as a leader of the Chicano Liberation Committee and other Chicano groups.
In addition, he was an Arizona leader of the Raza Unida Party. According to the standard history of the party by Dr. Armando Navarro, Grijalva was so militant that he alienated some members of Tucsons Mexican-American community. After losing in his first bid for elective office, a 1972 run for a seat on the school board, he began to cultivate a less radical image.[2][3]
In 1974, he was elected to the Tucson Unified School District board and served as a school board member until 1986. Grijalva Elementary School in Tucson was named for him in 1987.[4] From 1975 to 1986, Grijalva was the director of the El Pueblo Neighborhood Center, and in 1987 he was Assistant Dean for Hispanic Student Affairs at the University of Arizona. Grijalva was a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors from 1989 to 2002, and served as chairman from 2000 to 2002.[5]
Grijalva is a member of several dozen caucuses. A full list is available at his Web site.[6]
Grijalva co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus with Keith Ellison of Minnesota[7][8] and in 2008 was among 12 members rated by National Journal as tied for most liberal overall.[9] On the ideological map of all House members at GovTrack's website, Grijalva is ranked farthest to the left.[10] Liberal and progressive activist groups routinely give him high marks for his voting record. Grijalva received a 100 percent score from Americans for Democratic Action, Peace Action, the League of Conservation Voters, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Arab American Institute, and several other notable groups in recent years.[11] With the start of the 114th Congress, Grijalva became the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Natural Resources.
Grijalva is an advocate of mining law reform[12] and many other environmental causes. From his position on the House Committee on Natural Resourceswhere he has been the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands since 2007he has led Democratic efforts to strengthen federal offshore oil drilling oversight since before the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill[13] and introduced a successful bill to create a permanent National Landscape Conservation System at the Bureau of Land Management.[14] He was a leading candidate for Secretary of the Interior when President Obama was elected, but the job eventually went to Ken Salazar[15]according to the Washington Post, President Obama made the decision in part because of Grijalva's stated preference for more environmental analysis before approving offshore drilling projects.[16]
He has been a vocal opponent of Arizona's SB 1070 law that mandates police checks of citizenship documentation for anyone subjected to a legitimate law enforcement stop, detention or arrest as long as the officer does not consider race, color or national origin during the stop, detention or arrest.[17] Shortly after the measure was signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, Grijalva called on legal, political, activist and business groups not to hold their conventions or conferences in the state, a position that he said quickly became misconstrued as a call for a general boycott of the state economy.[18] In response, the Arizona Republican Party handed out bumper stickers reading ""Boycott Grijalva, Not Arizona."" After a federal judge stopped implementation of most of SB 1070, Grijalva withdrew the boycott, saying that he had reacted to it very personally. In an interview regarding the situation, Grijalva said that to all of a sudden have a law that separates me from the whole, I found very offensive and demeaning. [19]
He criticized the 2010 deployment of 1,200 National Guard units to the U.S.-Mexico border as ""political symbolism"" that he believed would not adequately address the issues of immigration and border security.[20]
Grijalva has frequently called for a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, and supports the wider implementation of the National Solidarity Program as a way to improve Afghans' economic and educational infrastructure.[21] The group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave him an ""A"" rating for the 2007-2008 Congressional session.
Grijalva has a pro-choice voting record and voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.[22] He was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which sought to place limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the Affordable Health Care for America Act.[23]
As co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Grijalva has taken a leading role in shaping recent CPC ""alternative budgets""budget bills offered by various groups and caucuses in Congress other than the official majority or minority party plan. In 2011 the CPC introduced what it called the People's Budget, which reached budget balance in 10 years according to an assessment by the Economic Policy Institute based on nonpartisan government data.[24] The proposal was noted approvingly by some of the world's leading economists, including Jeffrey Sachswho called it ""a bolt of hope . . . humane, responsible, and most of all sensible""[25]and Paul Krugman, who called it ""genuinely courageous"" for achieving budget balance ""without dismantling the legacy of the New Deal."".[26][27]
In 2012, again with Grijalva as co-chair, the Progressive Caucus introduced the Budget for All, which is similar to the People's Budget and includes several new features, including a novel proposal to institute a small personal wealth tax above $10 million in net worth phased in over a period of five years.[28] The proposal received 78 votes, all from Democrats, when the House considered it on March 29, 2012.[29][30]
On Feb 24, 2010, Grijalva wrote a letter signed by 18 other Representatives calling for an investigation of the BP Atlantis offshore drilling platform due to whistleblower allegations that it was operating without approved safety documents.[31] He has called for Atlantis to be shut down.[32] Since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010, Grijalva has written letters to the Minerals Management Service and the Department of the Interior questioning current offshore drilling regulations and calling for stronger oversight of the oil industry.[33]
Grijalva has gained prominence as an outspoken critic of what he calls lax federal oversight of the oil drilling industry, and in late 2010 launched an investigation of the White House's handling of the Horizon spill and its aftermath. That investigation revealed that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and elsewhere in the federal government had voiced concerns about drafts of an official government report on the cause and scope of the spill, but were overruled because the report was meant as a ""communications document"".[34]
In 2010, he introduced H.R. 5355 to eliminate the cap on oil company liability for the cost of environmental cleanups of spills.[35]
Grijalva has sponsored numerous education bills during his time in Congress, including the Success in the Middle Act[36] and the Graduation for All Act.[37] Grijalva has long ties to the educational community from his time on the board of the Tucson Unified School District and his current position on the House Education and the Workforce Committee.
As a member and chairman of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, Grijalva was widely regarded as a central figure behind the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan,[38] an ambitious County program for planned land-use and biodiversity conservation.[39] He consistently supported endangered species and wilderness conservation on the Board of Supervisors and has continued to do so in Congress, introducing a bill in 2009 to make permanent the National Landscape Conservation System within the Bureau of Land Management. In 2008, Grijalva released a report called The Bush Administration's Assaults on Our National Parks, Forests and Public Lands,[40] which accused the Bush administration of mismanaging public land and reducing barriers to commercial access.[41]
Grijalva supports increasing restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns and increasing enforcement of existing restrictions on gun purchase and possession.[42] He was one of the 67 co-sponsors of the 2007 Assault Weapons Ban, HR 1022.[43] Grijalva has an F rating from the NRA.[44]
As co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, Grijalva was a prominent supporter of a public option throughout the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[45] The House-approved Affordable Health Care for America Act included a public option  however, the Senate version did not include a similar provision, and it was ultimately not a part of the final reform package. Grijalva has largely been supportive of the health care reform law since its passage and argued the Supreme Court should not overturn it during a segment with Republican Rep. Peter Roskam, who opposes the law, for the PBS NewsHour on March 28, 2012.[46]
Grijalva has a long history in community health activism as an early supporter of Tucson's El Rio Community Health Center.[47] He supports single-payer health care, but voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act because he felt it was a major improvement over the status quo.[48]
Grijalva supports the DREAM Act and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act (CIR ASAP) and has recently come to greater prominence because of his role in promoting immigration reform.[49][50] He has opposed the expansion of a border fence, citing cost effectiveness concerns and potential damage to sensitive wildlife habitats.[51] The CIR ASAP bill includes his Border Security and Responsibility Act of 2009, which prioritizes remote cameras and other border monitoring techniques with a relatively slight environmental impact. The Immigrant Justice Advocacy Campaign gave him a 100 percent score for the first session of the 111th Congress. In previous years he voted against H.R. 4437 and the Secure Fence Act, and opposed Arizona Proposition 200 in 2004.
Grijalva has criticized armed civilian groups that patrol the Mexican border, accusing them of being racist and has reportedly used demeaning language to describe them. In return, some supporters of the armed patrols have called him MEChA boy"" in retaliation.[2][52]
Grijalva is a strong supporter of sovereignty and government-to-government relationships. In April 2010 he introduced the RESPECT Act, which mandates that federal agencies consult with Native tribes before taking a variety of major actions.[53] The bill would codify a Clinton-era executive order that has never had the force of law.
After the passage in April 2010 of Arizona's controversial SB 1070 law, which he saw as opening the door to racial profiling and granting traditionally federal immigration enforcement powers to local authorities,[54] Grijalva suggested that civic, religious, labor, Latino, and other like-minded organizations refrain from using Arizona as a convention site until the law was repealed.[55] His opposition to SB 1070, as well as his suggestion of a boycott of Arizona, was widely viewed as the reason for multiple subsequent death threats against him and his staff, which led to several office closures in the spring of 2010.[56]
When Judge Susan Bolton of the Arizona District Court enjoined major parts of the law [57] in July 2010, Grijalva ended his call for economic sanctions. As he told the Arizona Daily Star, the largest paper in Tucson:
""After this ruling, everybody has some responsibility to pause, and that includes me,"" said Grijalva, a Tucson Democrat. ""The issue of economic sanctions is a moot point now and I will encourage national organizations I'm in contact with to come and lend a hand - not just economically, but to help us begin to educate people about how we need to fix this broken system.""[58]
He subsequently said that his economic strategy was not as effective as he hoped in changing other state lawmakers' minds, and that he would focus on legal remedies in the future.[59] The issue became a focal point in the 2010 election, in which Grijalva ultimately defeated Republican challenger Ruth McClung by less than 10,000 votes.
Concerned about allegations of voting irregularities purportedly leading to disenfranchisement, in 2004 Grijalva joined Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and several other House Democrats in requesting that the United Nations observe and certify elections in the United States.[60]
After the General Election, Grijalva was one of 31 Representatives who voted in the House not to count the electoral votes from Ohio on grounds of unacceptable irregularities.[61]
After the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, Grijalva called it a consequence of the violent rhetoric that had been used by Tea Party members. Grijalva singled out Sarah Palin's rhetoric as contributing to this toxic climate and stated that she needs to monitor her words and actions.[62]
After the 2000 United States Census, Arizona gained two Congressional districts. The 2nd District, which had long been represented by Democrat Mo Udall, was renumbered as the 7th District. Ed Pastor, a Phoenix Democrat who had succeeded Udall in 1991, had his home drawn into the newly created 4th District and opted to run for election there, making the 7th District an open seat. Grijalva won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. Before the 2010 election, he was reelected three times with no substantial Republican opposition. In 2008, he defeated Republican challenger Joseph Sweeney.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Grijalva endorsed Barack Obama for President; his district, however, was won by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
During the 2010 midterms, Grijalva faced his toughest re-election campaign yet, against Republican Ruth McClung. It was reported that although Grijalva had decades of experience and McClung had none, and although there were twice as many Democrats in the district as there were Republicans, the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls. The main reason was Grijalva's call for a boycott of Arizona in response to the state's new immigration law, SB 1070. Grijalva won 50%-44% -- his closest margin of victory since being elected, and the first close election in what is now the 7th since 1978, when Udall was held to only 52 percent of the vote.
Grijalva's district was renumbered as the 3rd District after the 2010 census, and made somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor even though it lost some of its share of Tucson to the 2nd District (the reconfigured 8th).
Grijalva and his wife Ramona have three daughters.[64]"

Creighton University School of Dentistry","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar","Paul Gosar","Republican","President of the Northern Arizona Dental Society","Roman Catholic","Paul Anthony Gosar[2] (born November 27, 1958) is an American politician who has been a member of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona since 2011, representing Arizona's 4th congressional district. The district includes most of the rural western portion of the state, as well as a few outer suburbs of Phoenix. He represented the neighboring 1st district during his first term. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Gosar was born in Rock Springs, Wyoming in 1958,[1] the son of Bernadette M. (ne Erramouspe) and Antone John ""Tony"" Gosar. His paternal grandparents were Slovenian and his maternal grandparents were Basque immigrants from Banca, France.[3] He is the older brother of Pete Gosar, a former college football player at the University of Wyoming, who is the former Chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party and was a candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 2010.[4] He was the Democratic nominee for Governor in 2014, losing to the incumbent Republican Matt Mead in the November 4 general election.[5]
Gosar earned his B.A. from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, and later, his D.D.S. from Boyne School of Dentistry at Creighton, and owned his own dentistry practice in Flagstaff for twenty-five years. He was the Arizona Dental Association's Dentist of the Year in 2001, has been inducted into the ADA Hall of Fame, and served as their President. He was also President of the Northern Arizona Dental Society and the Vice-Chair of the ADA Council on Governmental Affairs.[6]
In 2009, Gosar--who had never run for elected office before--announced he would challenge Democratic incumbent Ann Kirkpatrick in the 1st district in the 2010 elections. Gosar has been identified as a Tea Party candidate by The New York Times because the Arizona Tea Party features Gosar on its website.[7] Libertarian nominee Nicole Patti was also on the ballot.
Gosar won the Republican primary. He was endorsed by Sarah Palin and three Arizona county sheriffs: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards, and Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu.[8] Kirkpatrick challenged him to five debates across the district.[9][10] Gosar initially agreed to one debate but later withdrew. Gosar released a statement explaining the decision to withdraw from the debate was based on the long drive to and from KAET in Phoenix, which organized the debate.[11] A producer at KAET said Gosar's staff told the station the candidate could not participate in the debate because he would be attending a fundraiser instead.[12]
Gosar defeated Kirkpatrick in the November 2, 2010, general election, taking 49.7 percent of the vote.
Following changes made in redistricting, Gosar was going to seek re-election in the 1st district, which was made less favorable to Republicans.[13] However, with Kirkpatrick priming for a rematch, Gosar changed his mind and announced in January 2012 he would run in the newly created 4th district, which is heavily Republican. As part of the move, he bought a second home in Prescott, which he claims as his official residence.[14][15]
Gosar initially faced a tough primary fight against Babeu. However, Babeu pulled out in May 2012 due to allegations of abuse of power.[16] Gosar then easily defeated former state senator Ron Gould and businessman Rick Murphy in the Republican primary, all but assuring him of a second term.
In the November general election, he routed Democratic challenger Johnnie Robinson, taking 67 percent of the vote. [17]
Paul Gosar describes himself as pro-life. On abortions, Gosar states, These procedures undeniably rob the world of a human life in a most cruel fashion...The right thing to do is to ban these procedures.[18] These beliefs are reflected in his voting record. Gosar cosponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, a bill that would make permanent restrictions on federal funding of abortions in the US.[19] Gosar also cosponsored the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, an act placing restrictions on abortions in the District of Columbia.[20] Gosar was given a 100% rating by the National Right to Life Committee, a pro-life interest group, and a 0% rating by NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League), a pro-choice interest group.[21]
Gosar has stated that the Second Amendment is one of the most important rights set forth by the Bill of Rights and has stated he will continue to oppose efforts to restrict, infringe, or remove this constitutionally protected right.[22] Gosar cosponsored the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, a bill that would allow noncitizens of a state to, with concealed carry permits, carry concealed weapons in that state.[23] Gosar also sponsored the Amendment to Restore 2nd Amendment Rights on Army Corps of Engineers Administered Recreational Lands, which would allow citizens to carry weapons on land administered by the Army Corps of Engineers.[24] Gosar was endorsed by the NRA (National Rifle Association) and given a rating of 92%. He was also endorsed by Gun Owners of America, and given a rating of 75%.[25]
Regarding immigration, Gosar has stated, I strongly believe we need to immediately secure our border and oppose amnesty for anyone who blatantly violates our law.[26] Gosar has cosponsored multiple bills that would impose regulations on immigration. For example, Gosar cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011, a bill that would eliminate birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants.[27] Gosar also cosponsored the Keeping the Pledge on Immigration Act of 2011, a bill that would increase border security.[28] Gosar was given an A rating by NumbersUSA, an organization in support of immigration reduction.[29]
In December 2014, Gosar drew controversy when he referred to American Indians as ""wards of the federal government"". He was responding to concerns from members of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona when he made the comment that stunned people at the round-table talk in Flagstaff, Arizona. The topic had addressed the proposal to swap 2,400 acres of southeastern Arizona's Tonto National Forest for about 5,300 acres of environmentally sensitive land. The proposal, which was attached as a rider to the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, would give land sacred to the Apache in Arizona to Resolution Copper Mine, a joint venture owned by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Troy Eid, a Republican and former U.S. Attorney in Colorado, responded to Gosar's comments and said: ""In the heated context of what this represents, it's especially inappropriate to be resorting to what amounts to race baiting."" A Gosar spokesperson said the congressman's comments were misconstrued.[30]
In 2010 Gosar signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[31]
Gosar is a member of several caucuses.[32]

Brigham Young University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Salmon","Matt Salmon","Republican","Arizona Senate, U.S. House","Mormon","Matthew James ""Matt"" Salmon (born January 21, 1958) is the Republican representative for Arizona's 5th congressional district. The district is based in Mesa and includes most of the eastern suburbs of Phoenix. He previously represented the district, then numbered as the 1st District, from 1995 to 2001. In 2002, he lost to Janet Napolitano in a highly competitive governor's race. He regained his old congressional seat in the 2012 election. Salmon and his wife Nancy have been married for 34 years. They have four children and six grandchildren.[1]


Salmon was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1991, he decided to run for elected office. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese.[2]
In 1990, he ran for the Arizona Senate in the 21st Senate District based in Mesa, Arizona. In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent State Senator Jerry Gillespie, who was controversial due to his support of impeached Governor Evan Mecham and his vote against making the Martin Luther King holiday.[3] In the general election, he defeated Democrat Bill Hegarty 60%-40%.[4] In 1992, he won re-election to a second term unopposed.[5]
In 1992, he was elected to a new leadership position called assistant majority leader.[6] He served that position until 1995.
In 1993, he sponsored legislation that created new drug test programs for employers.[7] That year, he also called for an independent study of the Department of Economic Services' child welfare agency.[8]
Incumbent U.S. Congressman Sam Coppersmith, a Democrat, decided to retire after one term in what was then the 1st District in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Salmon won the Republican primary with a plurality of 39% in a five-candidate field.[12] During his first Congressional election campaign, term limits were a high-profile issue. Salmon was one of many candidates nationwide who pledged to serve only three terms in Congress. In the general election, he defeated Democratic State Senator Chuck Blanchard 56%-39%.[13]
He won re-election to a second term with 60% of the vote.[14]
He won re-election to a third term with 65% of the vote.[15]
He honored his campaign pledge and did not seek re-election to a fourth term in 2000.
He signed the Contract with America.[16]
In 1999, he unsuccessfully advocated carving Ronald Reagan's face into Mount Rushmore, claiming that the former President had won the cold war.[17] Salmon was instrumental in obtaining the January 29, 2000 release of U.S. based academic researcher Song Yongyi from detention in China on spying charges.[18]
Incumbent Republican Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull was ineligible for re-election in 2002. In the Republican primary, Salmon defeated Arizona Secretary of State Betsy Bayless and Arizona Treasurer Carol Springer 56%-30%-14%. He won every county in the state.[20] In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee and Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Libertarian nominee Barry Hess, and former Arizona Secretary of State Dick Mahoney (who ran as an independent, but was previously a Democrat). Napolitano defeated Salmon 46%-45%, a difference of just 11,819 votes.[21]
After that race, he served as a lobbyist and chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. In 2007, he served as campaign manager to businessman Scott Smith's successful campaign for Mayor of Mesa.[22] In 2008, he became President of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade association.[23]
In April 2011, Salmon announced he would seek his old congressional seat, which was now numbered as the 5th District. His conception of term limits had evolved: in 2011 he stated that they were a flawed concept unless they were applied across the board.[24] His successor in Congress, Jeff Flake, was giving up the seat to run for the United States Senate.[25] He was endorsed by the Club for Growth,[26] Governor Jan Brewer,[27] Senator John Thune,[28] Congressman David Schweikert,[29] Congressman Trent Franks,[30] and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.[31][32] In the August 28 Republican primary, he defeated opponent Kirk Adams 52%-48%.[33][34] In the general election, Salmon defeated Democrat Spencer Morgan 65%-35%.[35] However, the 5th is a heavily Republican district, and Salmon had effectively assured his return to Congress with his primary victory.
In March 2013, he endorsed the idea of bringing back the Hastert Rule, which is that in order to bring a bill to the floor it must have a majority of the majority party's support.[36] He also proposed an amendment to the United States Constitution limiting House members to three terms in office and Senators to two.[37]
Salmon is pro-life and has opposed federal funding of abortions as well as family-planning assistance that includes abortions.[38][39]
Salmon voted to ban gay couples adopting children and opposes gay marriage.[38]
In April 2013, he announced that he would continue to oppose same-sex marriage even though his son is openly gay. His stances have been unmoved despite his acceptance of his son's homosexuality.[40] His son is a former leader of the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans.[41]
Salmon is strictly opposed to the surveillance of personal emails and phone-calls currently allowed and has called for legislation to reduce it.[42] He introduced a bill that would better protect privacy rights by limiting the ability of the government to perform unwarranted searches.[43]
Salmon has been a moderate supporter of environmental protection. He voted to enforce environmental standards on new pipelines, prohibit the EPA from being barred from investigations, reduce nuclear waste, and provide larger forest conservation.[38][44]
Salmon is a strong fiscal conservative and has often caused rifts and defections in his own party to oppose increasing the deficit.[45] He has strictly opposed raising the debt limit and any new spending without matching cuts.[46] He believes government agencies and institutions should undergo reform, not expansion, to meet their needs.[47]
Matt Salmon signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, stating he would never vote for legislation to increase taxes on Americans.[48] He opposes new government spending unless it has a plan to initiate some spending cut that will offset the loss.[46] He has voted to cut various taxes, such as the estate and marriage taxes.[49]
Following the recent IRS scandal and the wake of investigation, Salmon has called upon Attorney General Eric Holder to hold independent investigation on the IRS for its alleged targeting of its political opponents due allow for an unbiased non-government council to look into the matter.[42]
He is a cosponsor to a bill that would prevent politically-based bias causing any discrimination in tax treatment.[42]
In 2011 Salmon signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[50]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. He currently represents Arizona's 6th congressional district, which includes most of northern Phoenix as well as Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, and Cave Creek. He previously represented the 5th District from 2011 to 2013.
He previously served two terms in the Arizona State House of Representatives (19911994), was chairman of the state Board of Equalization (19952004), and was the elected Maricopa County Treasurer (20042007). He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives three times: losing a primary to J.D. Hayworth in 1994, losing the general election to incumbent Harry Mitchell in 2008, and then defeating Mitchell in 2010.


Schweikert was born in Los Angeles, California, to an unwed mother who almost aborted him but chose instead to put him up for adoption.[2] He grew up in Scottsdale with his adoptive parents and two adoptive siblings. He graduated from Saguaro High School there (1980), then earned a B.A. (finance and real estate, 1985) and MBA (2005) from the Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business.
Schweikert and his wife Joyce live in Fountain Hills.
Schweikert was elected to the Arizona State House of Representatives for District 28 in 1990, and re-elected in 1992.[3][4][5] He represented Fountain Hills and part of Scottsdale. He arrived in the wake of the AzScam scandal, and was a committee chairman[citation needed] as a freshman and majority whip in his second term.[6] His consistently conservative record led Republican colleagues to elevate him to Majority Whip.
As chair of the State Board of Equalization, Schweikert was also responsible for overseeing billions of dollars in valuations and tax protests from Arizona citizens and businesses.[7] There was speculation in 1999 that Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull might appoint Schweikert to the Arizona State Corporation Commission.[8] He was appointed chairman of the Arizona State Board of Equalization, a full-time job, where he served from 1995-2003.[9]
He was appointed Chief Deputy Treasurer of Maricopa County in 2004, and was elected Treasurer the same year. He resigned in 2007 to run for Congress again.[6][10][11] In 2008 he lost by 10 percentage points, 53-43%, to Democrat Harry Mitchell in congressional district 5. In 2010 he defeated the two term incumbent.
He ran for the September 1994 Republican primary in Arizona's 6th congressional district. It resembled the 5th district formed after the 2000 census, but also included most of the northeastern part of the state, including Flagstaff and the Navajo reservation. J.D. Hayworth defeated him 45%-22%.[12][13] After that defeat, he took time to reconsider and left for a lengthy vacation, which included travel to Calcutta, the Philippines, Myanmar, Nepal, Vietnam and Serbia.[1]
Schweikert won a six way Republican primary election September 2, 2008 with 30% of the vote, compared to 27% for his nearest rival, Susan Bitter-Smith.[14]
Several organizations endorsed Schweikert in the 2008 election, including the primary election: Club for Growth, the Arizona Police Association, Arizona Right to Life, and the Arizona Medical Association. Schweikert later blamed his defeat on the very bitter primary fight that preceded it.[15] He received more than a half-million dollars from the Club for Growth.[16][17] He was endorsed by the Arizona Police Association, which includes Chandler, Mesa, and Tempe law enforcement agencies,[18] the Arizona Right to Life,[18] the Arizona Medical Association[citation needed] and the Citizens Against Government Waste's political action committee.[5][19]
He lost the general election to freshman incumbent Democrat Harry Mitchell, 53%-44%.[20]
Schweikert sought a rematch with Mitchell in 2010, with Libertarian Nick Coons also running. Schweikert won the Republican primary on August 24 with 29% of the vote. Early polling showed the race a dead heat. The Club for Growth decided to again endorse Schweikert after having sat out the competitive primary election.[21]
On November 2, 2010 Schweikert defeated two-term incumbent Congressman Harry Mitchell 52%-43%.
After redistricting, the bulk of Schweikert's former territory became the 9th district,[22] while his home in Fountain Hills was drawn into the newly created 4th district.[23] However, as soon as the maps were released, Schweikert announced he would run in the 6th district. That district had previously been the 3rd, represented by fellow Republican freshman Ben Quayle. However, in a statement announcing his re-election plans, Schweikert pointed out that he'd grown up in Scottsdalemost of which had been drawn into the 6th as wellhad represented it in both the state house and in Congress, and owned a second home there.[24] A revised map, however, placed Schweikert's home in Fountain Hills into the reconfigured 6th.[25][26]
Quayle, whose home in Phoenix had been drawn into the 9th but was just outside the boundaries of the 6th, opted to seek re-election in the 6th as well. During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of ""going both ways"", suggesting that he was bisexual. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator Jon Kyl said that ""such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office"" and Senator John McCain said the mailer was one of the ""worst that I have seen"" and that it ""crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse."" Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer ""utterly false"" and ""a sleazy smear tactic."" Schweikert's spokesman responded that people ""should get their minds out of the gutter"" because the mailer was ""obviously"" referring to ""'both ways' -- as in liberal and conservative."" The Arizona Republic asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had ""never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way"" and said that it was ""difficult to believe"" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.[27][28][29][30][31]
Although the 6th contained almost two-thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the Republican primarythe real contest in this heavily Republican districtby 53 percent to Quayle's 47 percent.[32] He won re-election to a second term with 62% of the vote.[33]
Schweikert argues that the state's immediate objective must be to secure the border against smuggling and illegal immigration. After it is ""truly secure,"" lawmakers can proceed to establish a ""common sense temporary guest worker program to enable businesses to obtain the employees they need."" Additionally, Schweikert firmly opposes amnesty and ""sanctuary cities."" [34]
Schweikert has said the government should make providing resources to national intelligence, the military and law enforcement a high priority.[34]
Schweikert opposes restrictions on gun ownership. He has received an ""A"" rating from both the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America. He was endorsed by the NRA in his 2010 election.[35] Schweikert voted in favor of the National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. This act requires all states, regardless of their own laws, to honor concealed carry permits from other states.[36]
In November 2011, Schweikert wrote a letter to President Obama objecting to $70,000 spent by the State Department on books authored by Obama, asking the President return the royalties.[37] Embassies used the books as gratuity gifts and also to stock libraries in various countries.
Schweikert believes that economic prosperity hinges on balancing the federal budget and making ""hard choices"" on entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.[38]
Schweikert is strongly pro-life as proven by his vote for the Title X Abortion Provider Act, an Act that would deny all federal funding to Planned Parenthood. In addition, he voted yes for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in which the Act would ban any taxpayer from funding abortions.[39] After his birth mother decided against an abortion, she gave birth to him at an unwed mothers home where he was adopted.[40]
When asked about his stance on abortion, Schwiekert said ""In a still struggling economy, when our top priority should be creating jobs and paying down our debt, taxpayers need not be asked to open their checkbooks for such a controversial cause. Especially if that cause is taking the life of an innocent unborn child.""[39]
Schweikert is against an income tax increase on any tax bracket: he signed Americans for Americans for Tax Reform: The Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge is a pledge that many GOP candidates signed stating that they will oppose any and all efforts to increase the income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses, and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.[39] FreedomWorks, a ""lower taxes, less taxes, more freedom"" interest group, endorsed Schweikert in the 2012 general election.[39]
Schweikert voted yes on Opening the Continental shelf to oil drilling and voted yes for drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in pursuit of coal. He voted to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases.[41][42]
Schweikert signed the American's For Prosperity ""No Climate Tax Pledge"" in which he will ""oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue"".[41]
For the 113th United States Congress, Schweikert is now serving on the following committees:[43]
The House Republican Steering Committee removed Schweikert from the Committee on Financial Services in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.[44][45] He joined Justin Amash of Michigan and Tim Huelskamp of Kansas in a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, demanding to know why they had lost their ""plum"" committee posts.[46]
Politico quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia as explaining that Schweikert, Amash and Huelskamp were removed for ""their inability to work with other members."" The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland ""said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]."" The three were described by Politico and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as ""jerks"" who ""made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team"".[47][48]:p.2"

In 1984, while working as an engineer for an oil and gas royalty-purchasing firm, he began his political career by running for a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives, against incumbent Democrat Glen Davis, an attorney, in District 20 in central Phoenix. Franks, who was a member of the Arizona Right to Life organization and president of the Arizona Christian Action Council, campaigned against abortion and in favor of tougher child abuse laws. He defeated Davis by 155 votes.[8] In the state legislature, Franks served as vice-chairman of the Commerce Committee and Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Child Protection and Family Preservation.
Franks was defeated in his re-election bid in November 1986.[9]
In January 1987, he was appointed by Republican Governor Evan Mecham to head the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, which is a Cabinet-level division of the Governor's office responsible for overseeing and coordinating state policy and programs for Arizona's children.
In late 1987, Franks founded the Arizona Family Research Institute, a nonprofit organization affiliated with James Dobson's Focus on the Family.[10] He was the Executive Director of the organization for four and a half years.[11]
In April 1988, after Mecham was impeached and removed from office, Franks and other appointees resigned their positions. Franks had been under investigation following an Associated Press report about his decision to spend nearly $60,000, without getting bids, for a conference at a former campaign contributor's hotel.[12] Later in 1988, Franks ran again for a legislative seat, moving to District 18 shortly before the filing deadline.[13] He was successful in the Republican primary but lost in the November general election.
In 1992, when Franks was chairman of Arizonans for Common Sense, one of the organization's efforts was a constitutional amendment on the November 1992 ballot in Arizona that banned most abortions.[14][15] The initiative lost, getting about 35 percent of the votes cast.
In August 1995, Arizonans for an Empowered Future, of which Franks was chairman, launched an initiative campaign to amend the state constitution, replacing the graduated state income tax with a flat 3.5 percent rate, and allowing parents to deduct the costs of private-school tuition.[16] The initiative was not one of those appearing on the ballot in 1996.
Franks worked for and later became president of Liberty Petroleum Corporation,[17] a small oil exploration company established in 1996.[18] Franks served as a consultant to conservative activist Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign.[19]
Franks ran for Arizona's 4th congressional district in 1994, after incumbent U.S. Representative Jon Kyl decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He lost to John Shadegg, 43%-30%.[20]
Following the 2000 Census,[21] Arizona got two additional seats.[22] Franks decided to run in the newly redrawn Arizona's 2nd congressional district. The district, which had previously been the 3rd district, had come open after 13-term incumbent Bob Stump had announced his retirement. The initial favorite in the race was Lisa Jackson Atkins, Stump's longtime chief of staff, whom Stump had endorsed as his successor. Atkins had long been very visible in the district (in contrast to her more low-key boss) to the point that many thought she was the district's representative. Franks narrowly defeated Atkins in the seven-candidate Republican primary, 28%-26%, a difference of just 797 votes.[23][24] He won the November 2002 general election, defeating Democrat Randy Camacho, 60%-37%.[10][25]
Franks faced unusually strong competition in the Republican primary from the more moderate businessman Rick Murphy. Franks defeated him 64%-36%.[26] He won re-election to a second term, by defeating Camacho in a rematch, 59%-38%.[27]
He won re-election to a third term with 59% of the vote.[28]
He won re-election to a fourth term with 59% of the vote.[29]
Franks was again challenged in the Republican primary. However, he easily defeated Charles Black, 81%-19%.[30] He won re-election to a fifth term with 65% of the vote.[31]
For his first five terms, Franks represented a vast district encompassing most of northwestern Arizona, though the bulk of its population was in the West Valley. It appeared to be gerrymandered because of a narrow tendril connecting the Hopi reservation to the rest of the district. However, due to longstanding disputes between the Hopi and Navajo, it had long been believed the two tribes should be in separate districts.
However, after the 2010 census, Franks' district was renumbered as the 8th District, and reduced to essentially the Maricopa County portion of his old district. As evidence of how much the West Valley dominated the old 2nd, Franks retained 92% of his former constituents, even as he lost 85% of his old district's land. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Tony Passalacqua, whom Franks defeated easily, 83%-17%.[32] The new 8th was no less Republican than the old 2nd, and Franks won a sixth term with 63% of the vote.[33]
Franks won his party's election in the Republican primary on August 26, 2014.
The National Journal has ranked Franks among the ""most conservative"" members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2009.[34] He is a member of the Republican Study Committee. Franks has also been active with Operation Smile.
Franks is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[35] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[36]
On October 14, 2009, Franks joined with three fellow Representatives in calling for the investigation of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) over allegations of trying to plant ""spies,"" based on a CAIR memo indicating that they ""will develop national initiatives such as Lobby Day, and placing Muslim interns in Congressional offices."" The request followed publication of the book Muslim Mafia. Representative Sue Myrick had written the foreword, which characterized CAIR as subversive and aligned with terrorists.[37] CAIR has countered that these initiatives are extensively used by all advocacy groups and accused Franks and his colleagues of intending to intimidate American Muslims who ""take part in the political process and exercise their rights.""[38][39]
Franks is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[40] In 2010, Franks voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He has high approval ratings from the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council.[41] In November 2011, he voted to pass H.R. 2930, which authorizes crowdfunding for small businesses.
In 2009 Franks signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[42]
He opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, claiming the thought of Americans' health care decisions being put into the hands of an unimaginably large bureaucracy is a frightening prospect.[43] He is not supported by American Public Health Association or the Children's Health Fund.[44]
In September 2009, he stirred controversy when criticizing President Barack Obama. He said ""Obama's first act as president of any consequence, in the middle of a financial meltdown, was to send taxpayers' money overseas to pay for the killing of unborn children in other countries. Now, I got to tell you, if a president will do that, there's almost nothing that you should be surprised at after that. We shouldn't be shocked that he does all these other insane things. A president that has lost his way that badly, that has no ability to see the image of God in these little fellow human beings, if he can't do that right, then he has no place in any station of government and we need to realize that he is an enemy of humanity.""[45]
In a 2010 interview, discussing the legacy of slavery which Franks described as a ""crushing mark on America's soul"", the congressman said, ""Half of all black children are aborted. Far more of the African American community is being devastated by the policies of today than were being devastated by the policies of slavery.""[46][47][48][49][50]
In June 2013, he proposed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exceptions for rape and incest. In defense, he stirred controversy when saying that the incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low."" He later clarified, ""Pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare."" [51][52] The bill passed by a vote of 228-196.[53]
Franks presided over a hearing to ban abortions in the District of Columbia, in which he did not allow D.C.'s lone delegate and Member of Congress, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, to testify. In doing so, he said Congress has the authority to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever in the District, even though the heavily Democratic district is strongly opposed to the ban.[54]
Franks has also been involved in the founding of a crisis pregnancy center in Tempe, Arizona, that's still in operation today.[55] In the past, Franks has picketed abortion clinics but has ceased to do so stating in a June 2013 interview that ""It became clear to me that I could be more effective by trying to do something to light a candle rather than curse the darkness.""[55]
During the 2008 campaign, Franks stated that he is skeptical about global warming.[56]
He opposes same-sex marriage and abortion.[57]
Franks supports the right to bear firearms. The interest group, Gun Owners of America, have given Franks high approval ratings.[58] In 2011, he voted to pass the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act.[59]
Franks and his wife, Josephine, have been married since 1980; they are members of a Baptist Church, specifically the North Phoenix Baptist Church.[64] In August 2008, a donor egg and surrogate were used to give birth to their twins, Joshua Lane and Emily Grace.[65][66][67][68]
Franks is a past chairman of the Children's Hope Scholarship Foundation.[69]"

A member of the Democratic Party, prior to being elected she served in both chambers of the Arizona legislature, being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2005, and the Arizona Senate in 2011.
Sinema has worked for the adoption of the DREAM Act and has campaigned against Propositions 107 and 102, two voter referendums to ban the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona. Initially noted for her ""liberal record,"" she has since moved towards the center and ""carved a more bipartisan path.""[1][2][3]
She is the first openly bisexual person elected to the U.S. Congress.[2][4] Although some sources have reported her to be an atheist, she does not identify as one, preferring instead to eschew religious labels altogether.[5][6]


Sinema was born in Tucson, Arizona, in 1976. Her parents divorced when she was a child. When her stepfather lost his job, the family lived for two years in an abandoned gas station with no running water or electricity.[7] She was raised in a conservative Mormon family.[8]
She graduated as high school valedictorian at age 16 and went on to earn her B.A. from Brigham Young University in 1995 at age 18.[7] Sinema received her Master of Social Work from Arizona State University in 1999. In 2004, she earned a J.D. from Arizona State University College of Law. In 2012, she earned a Ph.D. in Justice Studies, also from Arizona State.[7][9]
Sinema was a social worker from 1995 to 2002. In 2000, Sinema worked on Ralph Nader's presidential campaign.[1] She also practiced law in the Washington Elementary School District[10] She served as an adjunct Business Law Professor at Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as Phoenix School of Law. Sinema became a criminal defense lawyer in 2005.[7][10] Sinema has also been an adjunct instructor in the Arizona State University School of Social Work since 2003.[11]
Sinema first ran for the Arizona House of Representatives in 2002, as an independent affiliated with the Arizona Green Party.[12] She finished in last place in a five candidate field, receiving 8% of the vote.[13]
In 2004, Sinema won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 15th District, where she won the highest margin of votes with 37%. David Lujan also won election with 34% (there are two seats in each District).[14] Sinema was subsequently re-elected three times with over 30% of the vote.[15][16][17] In 2009 and 2010, Sinema was an assistant Minority Leader for the Democratic Caucus of the Arizona House of Representatives.[18]
In 2010, Sinema was elected to the Arizona Senate, defeating Republican Bob Thomas 6337%.[19]
In 2005 and 2006, she was named the Sierra Club's Most Valuable Player. She also won the 2006 Planned Parenthood CHOICE Award, 2006 Legislator of the Year Award from both the Arizona Public Health Association and the National Association of Social Workers, 2006 Legislative Hero Award from the Arizona League of Conservation Voters, and the 2005 Stonewall Democrats' Legislator of the Year Award. In 2010, she was named one of Time Magazine's ""40 Under 40"".[20]
In 2006, Sinema sponsored a bill urging the adoption of the DREAM Act.[21] Also in 2006 she co-chaired Arizona Together, the statewide campaign that defeated Proposition 107 (which would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona).[22] Speaking to a now-defunct fashion/lifestyle magazine in 2006, Sinema was asked about ""new feminism"", and responded, ""These women who act like staying at home, leeching off their husbands or boyfriends, and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life."" After dealing with criticism, Sinema apologized and said the remarks were intended to be a ""light-hearted spoof"".[23]
In 2008, Sinema led the campaign against Proposition 102, another referendum which would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona. Proposition 102 was approved with 56% of the vote in the general election on November 4, 2008. Sinema chaired a coalition called Protect Arizona's Freedom, which defeated Ward Connerly's goal to place an initiative on the state ballot that would eliminate equal opportunity programs.[24]
In 2010, she sponsored a bill to give in-state tuition to veterans.[25] The Center for Inquiry presented Sinema its Award for the Advancement of Science and Reason in Public Policy in 2011.[26]
In June 2011, Sinema said she was considering running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. She lived in the same neighborhood as fellow Democrat Ed Pastor, but was adamant that she would not challenge another Democrat in a primary.[27] On January 3, 2012, Sinema announced her bid for Congress, in the 9th congressional district.[28] The district had previously been the 5th, represented by freshman Republican David Schweikert; it contains 60 percent of the old 5th's territory.[29] Schweikert had been drawn into the 6th Districtthe old 3rd Districtand sought reelection there.
Although Sinema was not required to resign her state senate seat under Arizona's resign-to-run laws (since she was in the final year of her term), she did so on the same day that she announced her candidacy. On August 28, 2012, Sinema won the Democratic primary with 42% of the vote, defeating former Arizona Democratic Party chairman Andrei Cherny, a former speechwriter in the Clinton administration, and state Senator David Schapira.[7][30][31]
In the general election Sinema ran against Republican nominee Vernon Parker, the former Mayor of Paradise Valley.[7] Sinema was endorsed by the Arizona Republic.[7] The campaign was described as a ""nasty"",[32] ""bitterly fought race that featured millions of dollars in attack ads"".[33] Parker ran campaign ads that accused Sinema of being an ""anti-American hippie"" who practiced ""Pagan rituals"".[34] The Republican-aligned outside group American Future Fund spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads against Sinema.[35] When Sinema's religious views were raised as an issue, her campaign stated that she simply believes in a secular approach to government.[5]
The November 6 election was initially too close to call, because Arizona election authorities failed to count more than 25% of the votes on election day.[36] Sinema held a narrow lead over Parker, while provisional and absentee ballots were still being counted.[37][38] However, on November 12, when it was apparent that Sinema's lead was too large for Parker to overcome, the Associated Press called the race for Sinema.[39] Once all ballots were counted, Sinema won by 4.1 percentage points, or 10,000 votes.[40] When she took office on January 3, 2013, she became only the second Anglo Democrat to represent the Valley of the Sun in almost two decades.
Sinema ran for reelection in 2014, and was unopposed in the Democratic primary, which took place on August 26, 2014. She faced Republican Wendy Rogers in the general election.[41][42]
According to Roll Call, Sinema billed herself as bipartisan. This is seen as a response to her district's voting pattern. It was drawn as a swing district, and voted for President Obama by just 4 points in 2012.[1] In September 2014, she was endorsed for re-election by the United States Chamber of Commerce, becoming one of five Democrats to be endorsed by the Chamber in the 2014 congressional election cycle.[43]
According to National Journal's 2013 Vote Ratings, Sinema's votes place her near the center of their liberal-conservative scale.[44] In early 2014, Sinema joined the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats who work with moderate Republicans to craft bipartisan policy.[45] On February 16, 2013, she announced she was part of an emerging effort, called the United Solutions Caucus, to end partisan gridlock in Congress.[46] This group of 32 freshman Republicans and Democrats was formed with the stated principles of strengthening and preserving Social Security and Medicare, promoting economic growth to generate revenue, cutting spending, and pursuing Medicaid waste, fraud, and abuse.[47]
On June 16, 2013, Sinema became an original cosponsor of the bipartisan LIBERT-E Act, along with Rep. Justin Amash, which limits the National Security Agency to only collecting electronic information from subjects of an investigation.[48]
On July 24, 2013, Sinema joined a bipartisan majority and voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bill to prohibit the National Security Agency from monitoring and recording details of US citizens' telecommunications without a warrant.[49] She later explained her vote against the amendment by saying, I, along with my colleagues in the House, was given assurances by the intelligence community that abuses did not occur intentionally or regularly, were quickly resolved, and were fully reported. I voted against the well-intentioned but overly broad Amash amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act in part because of these assurances, and due to my belief that we must strike a thoughtful balance that protects both our constitutional liberties and our security.[50]
Sinema voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act.[51] Sinema has called for reforms to the law.[52] She has said that the health care law isn't perfect, and that in Congress she will work to amend the law to make it work effectively.[53]
Sinema has voted to delay the initiation of fines on those who dont purchase insurance in 2014. She has also voted to repeal the Medical Device Tax and for the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.[54][55][56]
Speaking about healthcare policy, Sinema said, ""I used to say that I wanted universal health-care coverage in Arizona, which went over like a ton of bricks. Turns out, Arizonans hear the word ""universal"" and think ""socialism""or ""pinko commie."" But when I say that I want all Arizonans to have access to affordable, quality health care, Arizonans agree wholeheartedly. Same basic idea, different language.""[57]
After the September 11 attacks on the United States, Sinema was involved in organizing a Phoenix-area group called the Arizona Alliance for Peaceful Justice (AAPJ). According to The Hill, ""The groups mission statement at the time called military action 'an inappropriate response to terrorism' and advocated for using the legal system  not violence  to bring Osama bin Laden and others to justice."" Sinema wrote: ""As one of the core organizers against the war from day one (September 12, 2011), I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms.""[58]
Sinema has advocated against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and has helped form several groups that oppose the U.S.-Israel alliance. The AAPJ, which Sinema co-founded, has denounced Israels disproportionate use of violence and oppression, decried U.S. military aid to Israel, and protested the expansion of Israeli settlements into Palestinian lands. Sinema's activism and views regarding Israel have been criticized by Republicans and Democrats, including Jay Goodlik, a former Special Assistant to Bill Clinton.[58][59][60][61] Sinema is a former spokesperson for Women in Black, an anti-war group that was founded in part to support Palestinians during the Intifada.[59][62] She supports reducing defense spending.[63]
Sinema favors an income tax increase on the wealthy over cutting services. She has voted in support of federal stimulus spending.[63] She has said: ""Raising taxes is more economically sound than cutting vital social services.""[64]
Sinema supports abortion rights. She has been endorsed by EMILY's List.[63]
Sinema supports gun control.[63]
On November 17, 2013, Sinema completed an Ironman Triathlon in a little more than 15 hours. According to Politico, Sinema was the second active member of Congressbehind Senator Jeff Merkleyto finish an Ironman; although several sources, such as Triathlete Magazine, consider Sinema the first, since Merkley completed a non-Ironman-branded race.[68] On December 25, 2013, Sinema summited Mount Kilimanjaro.[69]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. Before he was elected to Congress, Crawford was a radio announcer, businessman and a soldier in the U.S. Army.


Crawford was born in the Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, the son of Ruth Anne and Donny J. ""Don"" Crawford.[3] Crawford grew up in a military family. His father served in the United States Air Force. He graduated from Alvirne High School in Hudson, New Hampshire. He enlisted in the Army, where he served as an explosive ordnance disposal technician for four years,[4] while advancing to the rank of Sergeant. After his service, he attended Arkansas State University and graduated in 1996 with a B.S. in Agriculture Business and Economics.
He has been a news anchor and agri-reporter on KAIT-TV in Jonesboro and Farm Director on KFIN-FM. He owned and operated the AgWatch Network, a farm news network heard on 39 radio stations in Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky.[5]
Crawford decided to run for Arkansas' 1st congressional district after Democratic incumbent U.S. Congressman Marion Berry decided to retire. Crawford received the endorsements of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former Congressman Asa Hutchinson, and former Congressman Ed Bethune.[6] He won the Republican primary, defeating Princella Smith 72%-28%.[7] He won the general election, defeating Berry's chief of staff Chad Causey 52%-43%.[8]
Crawford won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic prosecutor, Scott Ellington, 56%-39%.[9]
Crawford was sworn into office on January 5, 2011 as a member of the 112th Congress. He is the first Republican to represent his district in Washington since Reconstruction. The last Republican to represent to the district was Asa Hodges who depart the seat on March 3, 1875.[10] Crawford is a member of the Republican Study Committee.[11]
Crawford voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and to return federal non-security spending to fiscal year 2008 levels. He also voted to terminate taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns and party conventions.[12]

On January 18, 2013, Crawford introduced the Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act (H.R. 311; 113th Congress) into the House.[14] The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modify the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule, which regulates oil discharges into navigable waters and adjoining shorelines.[15] The rule requires certain farmers to develop an oil spill prevention plan that is certified by a professional engineer and may require them to make infrastructure changes.[15] According to supporters, this bill would ""ease the burden placed on farmers and ranchers"" by making it easier for smaller farms to self-certify and raising the level of storage capacity under which farms are exempted.[16]
Crawford and his wife, Stacy, live in Jonesboro with their children. He attends Nettleton Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist church in Jonesboro.[1]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. Prior to his election to Congress, Womack was Mayor of Rogers, Arkansas.


Womack was born in Russellville, Arkansas, the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack.[3] He spent most of his childhood in Moberly, Missouri; but moved back to Russellville at the age of 16 and graduated from Russellville High School in 1975. He graduated from Arkansas Tech University in 1979. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard. He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel. Womack's father founded KURM-AM in 1979, and Womack served as station manager from 1979 to 1990. He then served as executive officer of the Army ROTC program at the University of Arkansas from 1990 to 1996, then joined Merrill Lynch as a financial consultant.
In 1998, Womack was elected mayor of Rogers, the ninth largest city of Arkansas. He ousted 17-year incumbent John Sampier Jr. A major issue in the city was illegal immigration. The organization Americans for an Immigration Moratorium attacked Sampier for being a pro-immigration liberal. Womack pledged to get tough on illegal immigrants saying ""If you're coming to America illegally, you don't want to come to Rogers."" The city had a growing Hispanic population, where it made 20% of the population, according to the 2000 Census. A year after the election, the National Council of La Raza awarded Sampier for his courage in helping out Hispanic Americans.
In 1999, Womack had two agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service assigned to the Rogers Police Department. As a result, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed a class-action suit against the city policeforce for racial profiling.[4]
In 2002 and 2006 Womack won re-election unopposed.[5]
In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican John Boozman gave it up to run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman. He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.[6] In the June runoff, he defeated State Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe 52%-48%.[7]
In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.[8]
Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid. However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.[9] He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.[10]
In 2011, Womack filed an amendment to a spending bill in an attempt to defund Barack Obama's teleprompter.[11]
On February 14, 2013, Womack sponsored H.R. 684, the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, a bill that would allow states to charge and collect sales taxes on internet purchases.[12] Supporters say the bill will create a ""level playing field"" between online retailers and brick and mortar retailers,[13] while opponents argue that the bill would increase the power of the states, threaten consumer privacy, increase taxes, and hurt small businesses.[14] [15] [16]
In 2010 Womack signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[17]

LaMalfa was a co-author of ACA 20, which, similar to Arizona's new law, would empower law enforcement to act as Immigration, Customs Enforcement Agents and would have cracked down on illegal immigration.[9] ACA 20 failed to pass the first hearing by a 3-to-6 vote.

LaMalfa gave Democrat Governor Jerry Brown a ""C"" for his fiscal policies in 2011.[16]
LaMalfa opposed a bill that would require history teachers in all California public schools to teach history of homosexuality and gay civil rights.

They've really crossed a line into a new frontier.""[17]
LaMalfa strongly opposed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would eliminate the Electoral College. He argued ""I think this is dangerous. It flies in the face of 220 years of election law. We have an electoral college; it was put there for a reason.""[18]
In January 2012, U.S. Congressman Wally Herger announced that he was retiring and said ""Senator LaMalfa is running for Congress, and will do so with the endorsement of Congressman Herger.""[20] LaMalfa won the primary election in June 2012 with 38% of the vote in an eight-person race and winning 10 out of the district's 11 counties.[21] On November 6, 2012, LaMalfa defeated Democratic Party candidate Jim Reed 57%43%.[22]

Garamendi was previously the California Insurance Commissioner from 1991 to 1995 and 2003 to 2007, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior from 1995 to 1998 and the 46th Lieutenant Governor of California from 2007 until his election to Congress.[4]
Garamendi was born in Camp Blanding, Florida and raised in Mokelumne Hill, California. He earned a B.A. in business from the University of California, Berkeley and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, then served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1966 to 1968. He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1974, serving a single term before being elected to the California State Senate in 1976, where he served for four terms until 1990. During this time he had a spell as Majority Leader and ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nominations for Governor of California in 1982 and for California State Controller in 1986.
In 1990, he was elected to be the first California Insurance Commissioner, serving from 1991 to 1995. Rather than seek re-election, he ran for Governor in the 1994 election, losing in the Democratic primary. He left public office and served as President Bill Clinton's Deputy Secretary of the Interior from 1995 to 1998, then worked for the Peace Corps again. He was elected Insurance Commissioner again in 2002 and briefly ran for Governor again in the 2003 recall, before dropping out to support Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante.[5] In 2006, he was elected Lieutenant Governor to succeed the term-limited Bustamante.
Garamendi had planned to run for Governor for a fourth time in 2010[6] but after Democratic U.S. Representative Ellen Tauscher of California's 10th congressional district resigned to become Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security,[7] Garamendi won a November 2009 special election to succeed her.[8] He was re-elected in 2010 and, after redistricting, for the California's 3rd congressional district in 2012 and 2014.[9]


Garamendi was raised in Mokelumne Hill, California, the son of Mary Jane (ne McSorley) and Raymond V. Garamendi. His paternal grandparents were Basque immigrants from Spain and his mother was of half Irish and half Italian ancestry.[10][11] Garamendi received a B.A. in business from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was both a football player and wrestler, and a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School.[12] He served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1966 to 1968.[13] Garamendi is an Eagle Scout. Garamendi is also a member of Sigma Chi, as a brother of the Alpha Beta Chapter at Berkeley.[14]

Bagley did not run for re-election, instead running for California State Controller and losing in the general election to Democratic State Assemblyman Kenneth Cory. In the election to succeed Bagley, Garamendi faced Republican State Assemblyman Douglas F. Carter. Carter had won a special election in the 12th Assembly district in July 1973 to succeed Repyblican Robert T. Monagan, who had resigned to become United States Assistant Secretary of Transportation. In the general election, Garamendi defeated Carter in a landslide, by 60,380 votes (64.08%) to 33,842 (35.92%) as the Democrats won a supermajority in the California State Assembly for the first time since the 1800s.[15][16]

In the 1986 Democratic primary for California State Controller, Garamendi lost to Assemblyman Gray Davis, 50%-38%.[24]
He ran for California Insurance Commissioner for the first time in 1990. He won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 36% of the vote. His closest challenger was radio talk show host Bill Press, who got 28% of the vote.[25] In the general election, he defeated Republican Wes Bannister 52%-38%.[26]
His early years in the office brought him much controversy due to the state seizure of Executive Life Insurance Company, a bankruptcy that was coincidental with the creation of the state Department of Insurance. In addition to this had a number of other accomplishments. He successfully implemented Proposition 103, reforming the auto and homeowner insurance industry. Under his leadership, the department protected homeowners from the Oakland Hills Fire by forcing insurance companies to fully pay for rebuilding. His department earned a reputation as the best consumer protection agency in the nation.[21]
Garamendi ran for California Governor a second time in 1994. In the Democratic primary, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown defeated him 48%-33%.[27][28]
After his tenure as Insurance Commissioner, President Bill Clinton appointed Garamendi to serve as Deputy Secretary of the Interior, the second-highest post in the U.S. Department of the Interior. He resigned in 1998 and led groups of Peace Corps volunteers that helped negotiate peace in the EritreanEthiopian War and Congo Civil War from 1998 to 2000.[29] He then spent time in the private sector.

On July 16, 2004, Garamendi announced his candidacy to run for Lieutenant Governor of California, the first and only time he would run for this position. Incumbent Cruz Bustamante was term-limited and decided to run to replace Garamendi as Insurance Commissioner. Garamendi's endorsers included former Vice President Al Gore, Sierra Club, the California Teachers Association, the California League of Conservation Voters, the Peace Officers Research Association of California, the California Professional Firefighters Association, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, and former U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Garamendi won the Democratic primary by defeating state senators Jackie Speier and Liz Figueroa 43%-40%-18%.[32] In the general election, he defeated Republican State Senator Tom McClintock 49%-45%.[33]
As Lieutenant Governor of California Garamendi was the de jure President of the State Senate, regent of the University California, Trustee of the California State University System, member of the California State Lands Commission, Chairman of the California Commission for Economic Development, and acting Governor.[34]
Despite living outside of California's 10th congressional district, Garamendi announced his intention to run for the 2009 special election in the 10th district, where Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher had vacated her seat. There was some confusion about the location of Garamendi's residence. Garamendi said: ""My front yard is in the district, our bedroom is not.""[35] Garamendi continued to fuel speculation about the location of his residence when he made similar comments to the NYT in July, stating the same thing. The Sacramento Board of Elections later confirmed that no portion of Garamendis property lies within Congressional District 10.
In the September election, no candidate reached the 50% threshold to avoid a run-off election. Garamendi ranked first among Democrats with 26% of the vote, defeating State Senator Mark DeSaulnier (18%) and Assemblymember Joan Buchanan (12%). In the November run-off special election, Garamendi defeated Republican nominee David Harmer 53%-43%.[36][37] After winning the special election on November 3, Garamendi was sworn in as a member of the US House of Representatives on November 5, 2009.[38]
Garamendi won re-election to his first full term defeating Republican nominee Gary Clift 59%-38%.[39]
After redistricting, Garamendi filed papers in March 2012 to run in the newly redrawn California's 3rd congressional district.[40][41]
The old 10th Congressional District represented by Garamendi made up just 23% of the new 3rd district. While the old 10th Congressional District traditionally favored Democrats, the new 3rd District is now considered swing district by some.[42] Garamendi defeated Republican Kim Vann 54.2%-45.8%. [43]
Garamendi was re-elected.
During the 111th Congress, Garamendi voted with his party 98% of the time.[44]
While Democrats had the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2009 to 2010, Garamendi voted for most of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's agenda. Some key votes include his support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,[45] DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,[46] and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.[47]
Garamendi has voted with the Democratic party 93% of the time. Garamendi also voted against the balanced budget amendment.[48]
John Garmendi actively opposed a GOP-backed construction of a missile defense site on the East Coast, saying it was fiscally irresponsible to be ""spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a missile defense system that doesn't work.""[49]
Garamendi is also part of a bipartisan group that wants to challenge ""a new law that allows the indefinite detention without trial of suspected terrorists.""[50] He also voted against extending the Patriot Act.[51]
Garamendi is married to Patricia W. ""Patti"" Garamendi, who has worked as Agriculture Specialist for the California Exposition and State Fair and as Deputy Secretary of California's Business, Transportation and Housing Agency.

In 2000, he decided to retire from the California Assembly to run for California's 19th State Senate district. He ranked first in the May 7th open primary with 52% of the vote. In November, he defeated Democrat Daniel Gonzalez 58%42%.[13] In 2004, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Paul Joseph Graber 61%39%.[14]
McClintock has a long history of opposing various tax increases. During the 2000 dot-com bubble, he was instrumental in proposing a two-thirds reduction in the vehicle license fee, or car tax. In 2003, he opposed then-Governor Gray Davis's attempt to rescind a rollback of a vehicle license fee.[15] McClintock has also opposed deficit reduction efforts that would have increased taxes. He supported the Bureaucracy Reduction and Closure Commission and performance-based budgeting.[16]
He ran for California State Controller after incumbent Democrat Gray Davis retired. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Morris, 61%39%.[17] In the general election, he faced Kathleen Connell, former Special Assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Director of L.A. Housing Authority. Despite the fact that Connell outspent McClintock by a 3-to-1 margin, he only lost by two percentage points, 48%46%, with three other candidates receiving the other 6% of the vote.[18]
McClintock ran for State Controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character Angus McClintock, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling Tom McClintock's virtues of thriftiness and accountability with low-budget fifteen-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote. McClintock obtained 45.1% of the vote, while three other candidates obtained a combined 9.5% of the vote.[19]
In 2003, he ran for the recall election against incumbent Democrat Gray Davis. Film actor, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger won the election 49% of the vote.

On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican John Doolittle, decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the California Constitution required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.[26]
Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock.[26][27] McClintock was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus,[28] Club for Growth, and U.S. Congressman Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman Doug Ose, a moderate represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54%39%.[29]
The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charlie Brown, who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the California State Senate, despite the fact that he lived in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, ""Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here.""[30] However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent in home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband.[31] McClintock ran ads attacking Browns participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, an infamous anti-war group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[12]
By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.43% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine districts: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%).[32][33]
McClintock was challenged in the Republican primary again, this time by Michael Babich. He easily defeated Babich 78%22%.[34] On November 2nd, he easily won re-election to a second term, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61%31%, winning all of the counties in the district.[35]
After redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn 4th, which was moved significantly down the state. Only three counties remained from his prior district: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. Despite this, he easily won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Uppal 61%39%. He won all but two of the district's ten counties: Nevada (37%) and Alpine (41%).[36]
McClintock won re-election, defeating moderate Republican Art Moore in the general election, 60%-40%.
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 ""staunch"" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills.[37] In 2011, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[38] McClintock's Chief of Staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.
In 2009 McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[39]
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act (H.R. 3189; 113th Congress), a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands.[40] The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a ""new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.""[41] McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation ""illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend.""[41]
On June 14, 2013, McClintock introduced the bill To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take certain Federal lands located in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians (H.R. 2388; 113th Congress), a bill that would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.[42]

"25","","1999","1951","California 5","California State University, Chico","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Thompson_(California_politician)","Mike Thompson","Democratic","California State Senate","Roman Catholic","Charles Michael ""Mike"" Thompson[3] (born January 24, 1951)[4] is the U.S. Representative for California's 5th congressional district, serving since 1999. He is the current Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.[5] He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 1st District until 2013, includes Napa County plus portions of Contra Costa, Lake, Solano, and Sonoma counties.


Thompson was born in St. Helena, California, the son of Beverly Ann (ne Forni) and Charles Edward Thompson. His father had English ancestry and his mother was of mostly Italian and some Swiss descent.[6] He was educated at California State University, Chico, served in Vietnam with the United States Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade,[7] was a vineyard owner and maintenance supervisor, taught Public Administration and State Government at San Francisco State University and California State University, Chico, and was a member of the California State Senate before entering the House.[4]
Thompson served as an aide to Democrat Jackie Speier (then a state Assemblywoman) before winning election to the California State Senate in 1990. He very narrowly unseated 4th district Republican incumbent Jim Nielsen after Nielsen's reputation took a hit following a series of ethical missteps;[8][9] Thompson's margin of victory was less than 1 percent.[10]
Following the 1992 general election, Democratic state Senator Barry Keene of the neighboring 2nd District resigned. Thompson, whose hometown of St. Helena had shifted from the 4th district and into the 2nd district after reapportionment, decided to run in the 1993 special election for Keene's seat. He narrowly beat Republican businesswoman Margie Handley but won easy reelection in 1994.[11]
Thompson was approached by national Democrats about running for Congress in 1996 against freshman Republican Frank Riggs, but he declined, believing his senate seniority would be more beneficial to his district than would his being a freshman congressman. In 1998, however, Thompson was due to be termed out of the state senate, and opted to run against Riggs after all. Riggs opted to retire, believing that he faced almost certain defeat given Thompson's name recognition and reputation.[12] Thompson won handily. He has been reelected seven times with no substantive opposition, and has turned what was a swing district for most of the 1980s and 1990s into a fairly safe Democratic seat.
For his first seven terms, Thompson represented a district stretching from the far northern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area all the way to the North Coast. However, his district was renumbered as the 5th district after the 2010 census and was made somewhat more compact, losing most of its northern portion to the 2nd district.
Thompson is a Blue Dog Democrat and was previously a member of the New Democrat Coalition. He has been labeled as a ""moderate Democratic leader"".[13] Thompson has voted with the Democratic party 91% of the time.[14]
Although Thompson is a Roman Catholic,[4] he is pro-choice. In May 2004, he, along with 47 other Catholic Democratic Congressmembers, sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C. to dissuade him from refusing to administer Holy Communion to Catholic Congressmembers who practice pro-choice legislative voting.[15] Judie Brown, president of the pro-life American Life League, issued a response to the letter saying that it is harmful to the Catholic Church to ""[perpetuate] the lie that you can be a Catholic in good standing and support abortion.""[15] In February 2006, Thompson was one of 55 Democratic Representatives who were Catholic who signed a ""Statement of Principles,"" which affirmed a commitment to their faith, but said that they disagreed with their church on some issues. They stated that on those issues, such as abortion rights, they would follow their conscience instead of their church's teachings.[16] In response to the ""Statement of Principles"", the U.S. Catholic Bishops issued a ""Statement on Responsibilities of Catholics in Public Life"" that said, in part, ""Catholic teaching calls all Catholics to work actively to restrain, restrict and bring to an end the destruction of unborn human life.""[17]
Thompson has been a supporter of a public option for healthcare. In 2009, Thompson wrote that ""[b]y streamlining health care, reducing fraud and abuse, ending unnecessary testing, discouraging over-utilization, investing in smart reforms, and emphasizing preventive health care, we can significantly bring down the cost of health care.""[18]
In late 2002, Thompson joined Democratic Reps. Jim McDermott of Washington and David Bonior of Michigan on a fact-finding trip to Iraq. During the trip, the lawmakers spoke to officials in Baghdad and residents in Basra. Presciently, they expressed skepticism about the Bush administration's claims that Saddam was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.[19]
On March 26, 2008, Muthanna Al-Hanooti, an official of a Michigan charity, was accused of underwriting three members of Congress to travel to Iraq, on behalf of Iraqi intelligence officials. McDermott's office was already organizing the trip when the charity offered to pay trip expenses. McDermott's spokesman stated that the charity was fully vetted by the U.S. government. He also stated that the congressmen obtained a license from the State Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the group to travel to Iraq.[20]
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Thompson endorsed former U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) for President; his district, however, was narrowly won by Barack Obama.
The League of Conservation Voters publishes the National Environmental Scorecard for each session of Congress which rates how members voted on key energy and environmental issues. Mike Thompson was rated 92% (with 100% being the highest possible rating) for the 2nd session of the 110th Congress. His LCV Scorecard ratings have been at 90% or above for every session of Congress since 2001.
Thompson was endorsed for re-election in 2008 by the Humane USA PAC, a political action committee founded by leaders of animal rights groups such as The Humane Society of the United States, The Fund for Animals, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Doris Day Animal League, the Animal Welfare Institute, Farm Sanctuary and The Ark Trust.[21]
Thompson has an 88% lifetime rating from the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, which endorsed him for re-election in 2008.[22] This organization is the 501(c)(4) sister organization of Defenders of Wildlife.
The Sierra Club has endorsed Thompson for re-election in 2010.[23]
In March 2012, Thompson, along with Assemblyman Jarred Huffman, voiced his opposition to a piece of water legislation that the House would be voting on, which he argued would ""kill local jobs, ignore 20 years of established science and overturn a century of California water law.""[24]
Thompson voted for President Bush's Healthy Forests Initiative,[25] which some environmentalists saw as a preference to the timber industry.[26] He has disappointed some environmentalists with votes against limits to new commercial logging roads in Alaska's Tongass National Forest[27] and against limits to hunting bears over bait.[28][29] He was also one of only 30 Democrats to vote against an amendment to maintain roadless areas protected under the Roadless Rule.[30] Thompson received an A+ rating for his 100% voting record from the American Wilderness Coalition in 2004.[31]
While a California state senator, Thompson helped defeat legislation to halt the use of dogs in hunting of black bears[32] and co-authored and voted for a bill (SB 28) to resume trophy hunting of cougars.[33] SB 28 would have undone provisions of California Proposition 117 (the California Wildlife Protection Act of 1990) which had been approved by the voters in the statewide election held on June 5, 1990, that provided some protection for cougars.[33] Thompson was the House sponsor of the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Thompson was recognized as Federal Legislator of the Year by the hunting lobbyist group Safari Club International; he received the Hunting Heritage Award from the same group.[34]
Thompson is an active member and former co-chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus,[35][36] and is a lifelong hunter and fisherman.[37]
He is married to Janet Thompson and has two sons and two grandchildren."

He is a member of the Democratic Party. Bera won re-election in 2014[2][3] despite a very competitive race.[4] Bera is currently the only Indian American serving in the United States Congress[5] and the only Unitarian Universalist in Congress.[6]


Bera's parents immigrated to the United States from Rajkot in the Indian state of Gujarat in 1958.[7][8] He was born in Los Angeles and raised in La Palma, California.[9]
He has a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from the University of California at Irvine, also earning his Doctor of Medicine degree there in 1991.[9][10] He served as associate dean for admissions at the UC Davis School of Medicine and later served as the chief medical officer for the County of Sacramento.[5]
Bera challenged three-term Republican incumbent Dan Lungren in the general election. Also running were American Independent Party nominee Jerry Leidecker, Peace and Freedom Party nominee Mike Roskey, and Libertarian Douglas Art Tuma. He ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination in California's 3rd congressional district.[11] He raised more money than incumbent Dan Lungren for the five quarters through mid-2010,[12][13] making him the only Democratic challenger with more cash than a sitting Republican member of the House.[14] Bera was one of 17 candidates the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee targeted to take over Republican-held or open seats in 2010.[15]
Lungren was the only incumbent Republican whose race was rated as a ""tossup"" by CQ Politics, but was later rated back to ""Lean GOP"" in the final days before the election;[16] and the district was considered competitive by both parties. Polling by the liberal website Daily Kos in September 2010 showed Lungren leading Bera, 46%-38%.[17][18] Bera cited health care, education and economic recovery among his top legislative priorities. In November, Lungren won re-election, defeating Bera 51%-43%.[19]
Bera and Lungren faced off again in the 2012 congressional election in California's redrawn 7th district, with the redistricting occurring since the last election.[citation needed]
On Tuesday, November 13, 2012, Bera attended freshman orientation as congressman-elect while votes were still being counted.[3] Candidates in these tight races sometimes attend the orientation by the Committee on House Administration, which was overseen by Bera's opponent, Dan Lungren.[20]
On November 15, 2012, the AP called the race for Bera, who won 51%-49%.[21][22]
Bera ran for re-election in 2014, facing former Republican congressman Doug Ose in the general election.[23] The Rothenberg Political Report rated the 7th district ""Lean Democratic,"" but the Sacramento Bee reported that Bera was ""viewed by both parties as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country.""[2][3] Bera was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program, designed to support vulnerable candidates.[24] In June 2014, Politico reported that the DCCC planned to support Bera with $1.7 million in ads throughout fall 2014, and the House Majority PAC, a political action committee designed to support Democratic candidates, reserved $200,000 for late-election television ads.[25]
The Hill reported that Beras campaign received donations from parents of another Democratic candidate, Kevin Strouse, only to have Beras parents then donate a similar amount to Strouses campaign. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, ""The donations appear legal, campaign finance experts say, though two said any agreement among the parents to trade donations could be viewed as an attempted end run around contribution limits.""[26][27][28]
No Labels co-founder and former George W. Bush advisor Mark McKinnon said of Bera, ""He is the most important member of our Problem Solvers  of the entire group. He stepped up immediately as a freshman to take a leadership position. He was out early advocating on our big issues like No Budget, No Pay.[29]
In response to a poll, from the American Sikh Committee to Evaluate Congressional Candidates, Bera did not answer two questions relating to the Indian government's part in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Instead, he noted that in 2005, the former Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, had publicly apologized to the Sikh community for the governments role. Bera also stated that, while it was a tragedy, he was more focused on the treatment of Sikhs in the U.S. and could not dictate how the Indian government should approach the matter.[30] In response, some members of the Sikh-American community publicly withdrew their support for Bera. But with the majority of the Sikh-American population coming from outside of Bera's district, the advocates acknowledged that they were unlikely to affect the outcome of the race.[30]
Bera won re-election, receiving 50.4% of the vote to Ose's 49.6%.
In an interview covered in the Elk Grove Citizen, Bera said his first year in Congress ""was about being focused here in the district but also building my reputation in Washington, D.C.""[31]
In October 2013, Bera announced that he would give up his federal pay for the duration of the government shutdown. He also announced that in response to sequester cuts, he would donate 8.2% of his check each month to local organizations impacted by sequester cuts.[32]
In May 2013, Bera voted against repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[33][34]
Bera and his wife, Janine, have one child.[9] They reside in Elk Grove, California.[35]"

In 1994, he began working as an energy consultant for PG&E, FloWind, The Electric Power Research Institute, and other utility companies. Before being elected to Congress, Jerry served as the CEO of a 2004 start-up company manufacturing wind turbines, named HAWT Power (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Power). A 1992 article that he co-authored in an IEEE journal is a good example of his writings during this period.[5]
McNerney first ran for Congress against Richard Pombo in California's 11th congressional district in the 2004 House elections. He entered the race two weeks before the primary election as a write-in candidate. He qualified to be a write-in candidate for the March 2004 primary by one signature. Having no primary opponent, he won the primary and qualified for the November general election ballot as the Democratic nominee. He lost the general election, 61%-39%.[citation needed]
McNerney launched his 2006 campaign early in the fall of 2005. In June 2006 he won the Democratic primary with 52.8% of the vote, defeating Steve Filson, who had been endorsed by the DCCC, and Stevan Thomas.[citation needed]
In late July, Republicans Pete McCloskey and Tom Benigno (both of whom ran in the Republican primary against Pombo) endorsed McNerney.[6] In September, analysis of the campaign was changed from ""Republican safe"" to ""Republican favored"" due to the emergence of McNerney's campaign. The report noted ""a [GOP] party spokesman says it's because they want to win decisively but others speculate that internal polling has delivered bad news for the incumbent.""[7] On October 3, 2006, a poll commissioned by Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund was released with McNerney leading Pombo 48 percent to 46 percent.[8] Based on these events, in early October, CQPolitics.com changed their rating of this race from Republican Favored to Leans Republican[9]
On November 7, 2006, McNerney defeated Pombo 5347%.[citation needed]
McNerney won re-election 55% to 45% over Republican nominee Dean Andal.
McNerney won re-election 4847%, defeating Republican nominee David Harmer.[10]
For his first three terms, McNerney represented a district that encompassed eastern Alameda County, most of San Joaquin County and a small portion of Santa Clara County. After redistricting, his district was renumbered as the 9th District. It lost its portion of Alameda County, including McNerney's home in Pleasanton, while picking up part of Sacramento County. After the new map was announced, McNerney announced he would move to San Joaquin County in the new 9th. Although the new district is somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor, it is influenced by the Central Valley.[11] He eventually bought a home in Stockton. He won re-election 5644%, defeating Republican nominee Ricky Gill.[12]
In 2010, President Obama signed into law a bill written by McNerney which improves care of returning service members with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) by establisheing an evaluation panel to assess the Veteran's Administration treatments for TBI and recommend improvements. He also wrote a bill in 2013 that allowed veterans to keep receiving their benefits during the government shutdown.
McNerney was one of the first lawmakers to call for the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki following revelations in the news media about delays in care at VA health care facilities.[13]
McNerney is a proponent of renewable energy. He voted to reduce carbon emissions.[14] He has voted for tax incentives for renewable energy and for allowing states to impose stricter emissions standards. He opposes drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf.[15]
McNerney co-sponsored the bill To require the Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use for potable hot water (H.R. 4801; 113th Congress), would require the United States Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the effects that thermal insulation has on both energy consumption and systems for providing potable water in federal buildings.[16] McNerney said that ""it is important for us to look for ways to save taxpayer money and ensure the federal government is doing its part to preserve our natural resources.""[17] McNerney argued it would be a good way to collect data so that ""we can use the findings from this study and make sure we are doing everything we can in both federal and private buildings to maximize energy and water efficiency.""[18]
In 2007, McNerney voted against legislation that would have prevented the DEA from enforcing prohibition in the twelve states (including California) which allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes.[19]
In 2013, McNerney introduced the Methamphetamine Education, Treatment and Hope (METH) Act to modernize and expand programs that combat methamphetamine abuse by expanding treatment for addicts, particularly mothers or pregnant women, and provide grants to provide substance abuse and mental health services in rural areas.[20]
McNerney voted in favor of legislation allowing employees to form unions by signing cards authorizing union representation.[21] In 2009, McNerney voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He has opposed free trade agreements, voting against CAFTA, GATT, and the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement.[22]
McNerney resides in Stockton, California. He and his wife, Mary, have been married for nearly forty years and have three children.[citation needed]"
"30","","2011","1967","California 10","California Polytechnic State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Denham","Jeff Denham","Republican","California State Senate","Presbyterian PC(USA)","Jeffrey John ""Jeff"" Denham (born July 29, 1967) is the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district. He is a member of the Republican Party.
He previously served two terms in the California State Senate, representing the 12th District, which includes Madera, Merced, Monterey, San Benito and Stanislaus counties. Denham announced in December 2008 that he would be a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California in the 2010 election.[2][3] but dropped those plans when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Republican State Senator Abel Maldonado to fill the vacancy left by former Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi's election to Congress.[4][5] Denham subsequently ran for the State Assembly but dropped those plans as well when he was asked by retiring Republican Congressman George Radanovich to run for his open seat in California's 19th congressional district in December 2009.[6][7]


Enlisting at the age of 17, Denham served on active and reserve status for 16 years in the United States Air Force and is a recipient of the Meritorious Service Medal for his service during Operation Desert Storm (Iraq) and Operation Restore Hope (Somalia). In 2006, he was honored by the California National Guard with its highest military award, the ""Order of California"" service award, for distinguished service. After graduating from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Denham went into the agriculture industry.
Denham ran for the California State Assembly against Salinas City Councilman Simon Salinas as a political novice. Salinas spent $1,270,380 and Denham spent $1,109,466 which combined was one of the more expensive Assembly races of the year.[8] Salinas defeated Denham by more than 11,000 votes, or almost 9%.[9]
Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former state Assemblyman Rusty Areias. The election occurred on November 5, 2002 but the close vote count caused the lead in the race to go back and forth for several days.[10]
The race featured many negative political ads and those negative political ads appear to have allowed Jeff Denham to win against the more experienced Areias.[11] The race was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history with over $6,300,000 dollars spent.[12] The Denham campaign attacked Areias for outstanding tax liens. Republicans funded waves of campaign literature and television commercials renewing years-old charges against Areias on a variety of subjects.[12]
Denham won the race 48%-47%, or by 1,843 votes.[13][14] Denham managed a close victory in a seat where the Democrats had an almost 15% advantage in registration.[15]
Denham won re-election to a second term with 58% of the vote.[16]
During the 2007 Budget Crisis in California, Denham was the Republican that Democrats targeted to gain the necessary votes to pass the budget. In response to Denham's refusal to vote for the budget on the grounds that it wasn't balanced, Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata demoted Denham from his position as Vice Chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. At the same time, Perata started working with local Democratic parties in the Central Valley to create a petition to start a recall election against Denham. The California Secretary of State certified the petition, and its proponents collected 50,000 signatures before the deadline in February 2008.
On the June 3, 2008 election, the voters opposed the recall by a 76%-24% margin, and Denham continued as State Senator for California's 12th State Senate District.
During his time in the state legislature, Denham focused his efforts on education, agriculture and job creation. He called for a reduction in government waste in Sacramento, better use of state surplus assets and a crackdown on sexual predators.[17]
Denham's awards include Legislator of the Year by the California State Sheriffs' Association (2004), Outstanding Legislator by the California State Sheriff's Association (2005), Legislator of the Year by the California Small Business Association (2005), Most Progressive Law Enforcement Leader of the Year by A Woman's Place of Merced (2005), and California Teachers Association Gold Award (2005).[18]
In December 2009, seven-term U.S. Congressman George Radanovich announced he would retire due to health reasons. He endorsed Denham as his successor.[24]
In the Republican primary he defeated Fresno mayor Jim Patterson, former U.S. Congressman Richard Pombo, and Fresno City Councilman Larry Westerlund 36%-31%-21%-12%.[25] Denham won largely by running up the votes in Stanislaus and Tuolumne counties, as well as Radanovich's home in Mariposa County.
In the 2010 general election, Denham defeated Democrat Loraine Goodwin with 65% of the vote.[26][27]
After redistricting, Denham decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 10th congressional district. Former NASA astronaut Jos Hernndez ran against him as the Democratic candidate. Both of them lived outside of the CD.[28] The 10th is a swing district with a 25% Hispanic voting age population.[29] Denham won with 52.7% of the vote to Democratic Hernndez's 47.3%.
In 2014 no Republican ran against Denham in the primary. Although Denham is expected to receive media endorsements over his Democratic opponent Michael Eggman,[30] his seat was regarded by some as ""vulnerable"" earlier in the year[30][31] The Rothenberg Political Report, however, now lists the race as ""Republican Favored.""[32]
In the 112th Congress, Denham voted with his party 95% of the time, and has voted with his party 90% of the time overall.[33]
In July 2012, he criticized an event put on by the General Services Administration, which cost $268,732. He said that he believes the controversy goes even further than the GSA.[34]
In October 2013, Denham co-sponsored the comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced by House Democrats. In announcing his support for the bill, he stated: ""We cant afford any more delays. I support an earned path to citizenship to allow those who want to become citizens to demonstrate a commitment to our country, learn English, pay fines and back taxes and pass background checks.""[35]
Denham has argued that the national deficit is the biggest issue, which he called a threat to the nation's freedom. He has stressed his desire to use the economic downturn to reassess and find different ways to drive the United States forward.[36]
In August 2014, Denham broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.[37]
He owns and operates Denham Plastics, a supplier of reusable containers in the agriculture industry.[38] He and his family also farm almonds at their ranch in Merced County.[39]
Denham and his wife Sonia have two children, Austin and Samantha.[40]"

Previously, he served in the California Legislature representing California's 7th State Senate district from 2008 to 2015. From 2006 to 2008, DeSaulnier represented California's 11th State Assembly district. He also served as a Contra Costa County supervisor (district 4, 19942006) and on the Concord City Council (19911994).
In March 2009, DeSaulnier announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in the special election for the 10th congressional district after the resignation of the incumbent Ellen Tauscher. DeSaulnier received endorsements from Congresswoman Tauscher and Congressman George Miller for the seat. In the September 1 primary election, DeSaulnier came in second, after John Garamendi.
In 2014 after George Miller announced his retirement, DeSaulnier announced his candidacy for California's 11th congressional district. [2]He won the general election in a landslide victory. DeSaulnier took office on January 3, 2015.


Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, DeSaulnier earned a Bachelor of Arts in History from the College of the Holy Cross. He traveled cross-country to California in the early 1970s and eventually settled in Concord. As a young man, DeSaulnier worked as a probation officer, a truck driver and a hotel services employee. DeSaulnier was a member of both the Teamsters International Union and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. His jobs allowed his early exposure to the challenges of working families and the power of organized labor to create equity among employers and employees. A small businessman, DeSaulnier owned and operated several restaurants in the greater Bay Area before taking office in the Legislature in 2006. He is a member of the Concord Chamber of Commerce and the Contra Costa Council. DeSaulnier lives in Concord where he raised his two adult sons, Tristan and Tucker. He is an avid runner and has completed twenty-one marathons.[citation needed]
DeSaulnier was appointed to the Concord Planning Commission in 1988. In 1991, he was elected to the Concord City Council and served as mayor of Concord in 1993. He was also a member of the University of California Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program Advisory Committee.
In early 1994, Republican Governor Pete Wilson appointed DeSaulnier, then a fellow Republican, to the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors district 4, filling a vacancy caused by the resignation of Supervisor Sunne McPeak.[3] DeSaulnier served on the Board of Supervisors until 2006. He was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. In June 1998, he received 98.4 percent of the vote against write-in candidates.[4] In March 2002, he retained his seat with 79 percent of the vote against challenger Dione Mustard.[5]
Although the Board of Supervisors is a non-partisan office, DeSaulnier was active in Republican party affairs during much of his tenure as county supervisor. In September 1998, for example, he donated $200.00 to the United Republican Finance Committee of the Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee, thereby aiding Dan Lungren (R) in the gubernatorial race against Gray Davis (D), Matt Fong (R) in his U.S. Senate race against Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), Charles Ball (R) in his congressional race against Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D), and Allen Payton (R) in his Assembly race against Assemblyman Tom Torlakson (D).[6] Many of the candidates that DeSaulnier aided supported the anti-union Proposition 226 on the June 1998 statewide ballot.
During DeSaulnier's tenure on the Board of Supervisors, he sponsored the Industrial Safety Ordinance and the Refinery Flare Rule for local refineries and chemical facilities. DeSaulnier served on the executive boards of the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. He was appointed to represent the Bay Area on the California Air Resources Board by the Air District (19972006).
As a member of the Air Resources Board, DeSaulnier supported strong environmental regulations, including cleaner-burning gasoline, lower-emission vehicles (LEVs), the identification of diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, dioxin monitoring in the Bay Area, the banning of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline, the identification of secondhand smoke as a carcinogen, the reduction of emissions from dairy farms, the phase-out of rice straw in the central valley and the reduction of emissions from cruise ships.
On a county level, DeSaulnier introduced a Women's Health Program to serve the health-care needs of all women in Contra Costa County. He also established the annual Children and Families' Budget, a separate County budget that reviews and measures the effectiveness of County programs in these areas. His other projects for children include AfterSchool4All, the Future Fund and the Children and Families Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
The Contra Costa Times editorial board was critical of DeSaulnier's record as county supervisor. An editorial published in 2009 stated, ""Many of the financial problems that afflict Contra Costa County today stem directly from decisions DeSaulnier championed while he was supervisor. Most notably, in 2002, at a time when the county faced a $31.5 million shortfall, was already laying off workers and was already experiencing increased public employee pension costs, DeSaulnier supported unsustainable pension increases that hiked benefits for public safety workers by as much as 50 percent. The plan allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with a pension worth 3 percent of their salary for each year served. Such excessive public employee union benefits have strained some local jurisdictions to the brink of bankruptcy.""[7]
In the June 2006 Democratic primary, DeSaulnier carried 52% of the vote against Laura Canciamilla and two other opponents.[8] DeSaulnier was endorsed by the San Francisco Chronicle, the Contra Costa Times,[9] US Senator Barbara Boxer and California Senator Tom Torlakson. DeSaulnier won a decisive victory in the 2006 general election against Republican Arne Simonsen and Libertarian Cory Nott with 66% of all votes cast.[10]
In the Assembly, DeSaulnier chaired the Committee on Transportation and the Select Committees on Growth Management and Air Quality. He was also a member of the Assembly Committees on Appropriations, Human Services, Rules and Labor and Employment.
DeSaulnier authored or co-authored over 40 bills during the 2007-2008 legislative session. His bills addressed truancy among school children, preschool access, suicide prevention, childhood obesity, reducing air pollution, smoke-free workplaces, and the creation of opportunities for at-risk youth.
One bill introduced by DeSaulnier, AB 1617, would have restricted tobacco smokers from purchasing tobacco products via the internet.[11] The bill was vetoed by Governor Schwarzenegger.[12] Another DeSaulnier bill, AB 2235, which would require that a biometric feature be incorporated into all new handguns sold in California to keep guns out of the hands of thieves and children.[13] For this, DeSaulnier received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[citation needed]
For the Live Earth concert in July 2007, DeSaulnier delivered the Democratic weekly radio address on steps people can take to reduce their carbon footprint.[14]
DeSaulnier was elected to the California State Senate in November 2008, representing the 7th Senate district which includes most of Contra Costa County. DeSaulnier received early support from the Contra Costa Central Labor Council, the Contra Costa Building Trades Council and the California League of Conservation Voters. He received 98% of the vote in the June 2008 Democratic primary election against write-in candidates; former Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla initially was to challenge DeSaulnier for the Senate seat, but dropped out of the race. In the 2008 general election, DeSaulnier received 66.6% of the vote against Republican Christian Amsberry.
In the Senate, DeSaulnier is the chair of the Labor and Industrial Relations committee, and a member of the Health, Transportation and Housing, and Appropriations committees. He is also the chair of the select committees on Constitutional Reform and Growth Management.[15]
DeSaulnier has authored over 20 bills that address the ability of workers to designate their treating physician prior to an injury, providing for greater prescription drug safety, supporting increased funding for alcohol-abuse programs, expanding electronic recycling and funding for climate protection. DeSaulnier also supports Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCR)3 to propose to California voters the question of whether to call a convention to reform the state constitution.[16]
In September 2009, DeSaulnier amended SB 88 to attempt to restrict the ability of local governments to shed pension programs through bankruptcy protection.[17]
In 2012, DeSaulnier proposed a bill, SB1366, that would require gun owners whose guns are stolen or lost report the fact to police within 48 hours.[18][19] Failure to comply would result in fines on the first and second offenses, with higher fines and possible jail on the third.[18] The bill is endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chiefs Association,[20] and opposed by the California Rifle and Pistol Association.[18]
In November 2014, DeSaulnier was elected to represent California's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. As a result, DeSaulnier resigned his state senate seat in order to elevate to Congress.[21]

Northern California Democratic Party Chairwoman","Roman Catholic","Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi (/plosi/; born March 26, 1940) is the Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and served as the 60th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. She is the only woman to have served as the House Speaker and to date is the highest-ranking female politician in American history.[1]
A member of the Democratic Party, Pelosi represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four-fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. The district was numbered as the 5th during Pelosi's first three terms in the House, and as the 8th from 1993 to 2013. She served as the House Minority Whip from 2002 to 2003, and was House Minority Leader from 2003 to 2007, holding the post during the 108th and 109th Congresses. Pelosi is the first woman, the first Californian and first Italian-American to lead a major party in Congress. After the Democrats took control of the House in 2007 and increased their majority in 2009, Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House for the 110th and 111th Congresses.
On November 17, 2010, Pelosi was elected as the Democratic Leader by House Democrats and therefore the Minority Leader in the Republican-controlled House for the 112th Congress.[2]


Pelosi is Italian-American and was born Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro in Baltimore, Maryland, the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. ""Nancy"" (ne Lombardi) and Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., who was a Democratic party U.S. Congressman from Maryland and a Mayor of Baltimore.[3][4] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971, when he declined to run for a second term.
Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. In her outgoing remarks as the 60th Speaker of the House, Pelosi noted that she had been present at John F. Kennedy's inaugural address as President in January 1961. She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, a Catholic all-girls high school in Baltimore, and from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University) in Washington, D.C., in 1962 with a B.A. in political science. Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.[5] She met Paul Frank Pelosi (b. April 15, 1940, in San Francisco)[6] while she was attending Trinity College.[7] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[8] After the couple married, they moved to New York, and then to San Francisco in 1969, where Mr. Pelosi's brother, Ronald Pelosi, was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[9]
After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi worked her way up in Democratic politics. She became a friend of one of the leaders of the California Democratic Party, 5th District Congressman Phillip Burton.
In 1976, Pelosi was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996.[10] She was elected as party chair for Northern California on January 30, 1977, and for the California Democratic Party, which she held from 1981 until 1983.[10]
Pelosi was appointed Finance Chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of the U.S. Senate Democrats, in 1985.[10] That same year, she ran to succeed Chuck Manatt as chair of the Democratic National Committee, but lost to then-DNC Treasurer Paul G. Kirk.[11] Pelosi left her post as DSCC finance chair in 1986.[10]
Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.[12] Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.[13][14]
Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won the seat in her own right in 1988 and has been reelected 10 more times with no substantive opposition, winning by an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.[15] The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2008 when anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan polled 16% and Pelosi won with 72%.
She has the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.[16]
In the House, she served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as Minority Leader.[17]
In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House Minority Whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.
In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.[18]
On November 16, 2006, Pelosi was unanimously chosen by her caucus as the Democratic candidate for Speaker, effectively making her Speaker-elect. While the Speaker is elected by the full House membership, in modern practice the election is a formality, since the Speaker always comes from the majority party.
Pelosi supported her longtime friend John Murtha of Pennsylvania for the position of House Majority Leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[19] Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House Majority Leader over Murtha by a margin of 14986 within the caucus.[20]
On January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for Speaker of the House.[21] She was nominated by Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and sworn in by her longtime friend John Dingell of Michigan as the Dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.
With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the Speakership. She is also the second Speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.
During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of Speaker:
""This is a historic moment  for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them"".[23]
She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:
""The election of 2006 was a call to change  not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.""[23]
As Speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the Speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate (though she had the right to do so), and almost never voted on the floor. She was also not a member of any House committees.
Pelosi was re-elected Speaker in 2009.
A CBS News poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of the speaker, with 11% approving.[24] According to a March 2010 Rasmussen poll, 64% of voters nationally view the speaker unfavorably, and 29% have a favorable opinion of Pelosi.[25]
Shortly after winning re-election, President George W. Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[26] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.[27][28]
In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed that Democrats should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant.
In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional electionswhich offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was ""off the table"". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, ""you never know where"" investigations might lead.)[29]
After becoming Speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[30]
Prior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress' term.[31][32]
The origin for the name ""first hundred hours"" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression) during his ""first hundred days"" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became Speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America.
On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter saying, ""[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.""[33]
Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[34]
Pelosi has been credited for spearheading President Obama's health care law when it seemed that it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democratic Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election and thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as ""kiddie care."" After convincing the president that this would be their only shot at health care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an ""unbelievable marathon"" of a two-month session to craft the health care bill, which successfully passed the House. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being ""one of the best Speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.""[35][36][37]
Though Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. Despite the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of Minority Leader, the office she held prior to becoming Speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[38] Pelosi was elected Minority Leader for the 112th Congress. On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced she would remain on as Democratic leader.[39]
In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other member of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report ""a right-wing smear.""[40][41][42] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of Representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they ""shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all.""[43][44]
Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but left in 2003 after being elected Minority Leader. Her longtime friend Jim McDermott of Washington told Newsweek that he and other left-leaning Democratic congressmen sometimes wish that ""she would tilt a little more our way from time to time"". As Speaker, Pelosi has tried to focus more on economic than social issues.[45]
In San Francisco, Pelosi has experienced conflicts with anti-war activists.[46][47] Nonetheless, she has never faced a serious challenger in the Democratic primary or from the Green Party, which is competitive in local elections.
On September 2, 2008, she visited Hiroshima, Japan, for a G8 summit meeting of lower house speakers and offered flowers in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park for the victims of the 1945 atomic bombing. While many world leaders have visited Hiroshima over the years, she is the highest-ever sitting U.S. official to pay her respects.[48]
On March 21, 2008, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet and called on ""freedom-loving people"" worldwide to denounce China.[49] She was quoted as saying, ""The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world"", while addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India.[49] She however did not call for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics that were held in Beijing.[50]
On October 24, 2008, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its ""bold decision"" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia. Pelosi's statement read, ""I call on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.""[51]
Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian President lvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state trip to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had ""expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations"" of links between Paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[52] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free trade agreement.[53]
In 2001, Pelosi voted in favor of keeping the travel restrictions on American citizens to Cuba, until the President has certified that Cuba has released all political prisoners, and extradited all individuals sought by the U.S. on charges of air piracy, drug trafficking and murder.[54]
In a February 15, 2007, interview, Pelosi noted that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran ""and I take him at his word"". At the same time, she said, ""I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran"".[55][56] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[57] requiring that  absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces  the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[58] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.
In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[59] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's prime minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.-Turkey relations.[60] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[61]
In March 2009, the New York Post wrote that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff that requested that the United States Air Force (USAF) provide specific aircrafta Boeing 757for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[62][63][64] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession) and was initially provided for the previous Speaker, Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested, for security reasons, that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said ""no one has rendered judgment"" that Pelosi's use of aircraft ""is excessive.""[65]
Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[66]
She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas (HA 209, rejected), in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision that forbids service women and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected), in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that uses its own funds to provide abortion services or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[66]
In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI as a result of comments made by Pelosi to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press that many observers felt inaccurately portrayed Church teaching on the subject of abortion and the beginning of life.[67][68]
Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the controversial banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the ""Boldest possible move"" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim and fellow gun control advocate, Gabriel Giffords.[69] In 2012, she was given 0% ratings by both the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America for her stances on gun control.[70]
In a February, 2013, interview with Fox News, Pelosi misstated that gun ownership was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.[71][72][73] The First Amendment addresses freedom of speech and the press, and it is the Second Amendment that addresses gun ownership.
Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by the House by a 300132 vote, but in the Senate fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required (with 65 out of 100 Senators voting in favor).[74]
As Speaker of the House, she also spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[75] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[76] As of the 2002, 2004, and 2006 election cycles, Del Monte has not contributed to Democratic candidates.[77]
Pelosi opposed the welfare reform proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[78]
The American Civil Liberties Union's Congressional Scorecard has given Pelosi a lifetime rating of 92% for her voting record on civil liberties.[79] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[80] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[81]
In a January 25, 2009, interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said, ""Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those  one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.""[82]
In 1999, Pelosi voted against the Ten Commandments being in public buildings, including schools[83] Pelosi voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[84]
Pelosi has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence upon foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[85] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[86]
Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[87]
Speaker Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[36] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[88]
Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[89]
Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[90]
In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force against Iraq,[91] while stating that Iraq, like ""other countries of concern"", had WMDs.[92] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi noted that Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet had told Congress that the likelihood of Iraq's Saddam Hussein launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low. ""This is about the Constitution"", Pelosi said. ""It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops."" Despite Pelosi's opposition, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.[93]
Pelosi reaffirms that ""America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship"".[94] Pelosi emphasized that ""a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,...[h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe."" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli ""hopeful signs"" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian ""threats"" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, ""If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace"".[94]
During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that ""the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond"". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah ""have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent"". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border ""have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah"" in part for their use of ""civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas"".[95]
In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the ""strong friendship"" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and stated that she keeps them as a ""symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel"".[96]
Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[78][97]
Pelosi received a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign for the 107th, 108th, and 109th sessions of Congress, indicating that she voted in agreement with HRC's slate of pro-gay legislative issues.[98] In 1996 she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[99] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize gay marriage.[100][101] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the ""historic decision."" She voiced her opposition to Proposition 8, the successful ballot initiative, which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[102] Pelosi states that her Catholic faith is behind her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage: ""My religion compels meand I love it for itto be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think its unconstitutional on top of that.""[103]
Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws.[104] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[105]
In regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi stated that she did not support such legislation.[106]
Pelosi supports the Bush/Obama NSA spying program called PRISM. On June 22, 2013 she was booed at Netroots Nation for saying Edward Snowden was a criminal.[107]
Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that ""for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough"" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. ""If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.""[108] In April 2007, she visited Damascus and stated there ""the road to Damascus is a road to peace.""[109]
Pelosi has stated that she now opposes the interrogation technique of waterboarding.[110]
According to the CIA, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah,[111][112][113] in one hour-long briefing in 2002. After the briefing, Pelosi said she ""was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal.""[114] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say that the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she didn't raise substantial objections.[115] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, ""In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.' ""[116]
However, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a ""number of years"" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[117] Neither letter, lawmakers or the CIA provided details and the circumstances surrounding the allegations make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[118]
Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from being able to take notes or consult legal experts or members of her own staffs.[119] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi stated, ""In that or any other briefingwe were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel  the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further  further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time""[120][121] Pelosi's office stated that she later protested the technique and that she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[110]
In mid-July 2008, two days after President George W. Bush stated that Congress was ineffective and said, ""This is not a record to be proud of, and I think the American people deserve better"",[122] Pelosi responded by calling the president ""a total failure, losing all credibility with the American people on the war, on the economy, on energy, you name the subject"" and that Congress had been ""sweeping up after his mess over and over and over again"".[122]
Pelosi's only close race so far has been the special election to succeed Sala Burton's seat after her death in February 1987. In the special election's Democratic primary, Pelosi narrowly defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt, considered the more ""progressive"" candidate, with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent.[12][123] In the runoff against Republican candidate Harriet Ross, Pelosi received more than a 2-to-1 majority of votes cast in a turnout that comprised about 24% of eligible voters.[124] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district for the 1988 and 1990 Race for U.S. House of Representatives. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 Census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only twice.
Her husband, since 1963, is Paul Pelosi. They have five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as eight grandchildren. Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[125]
Pelosi lives in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.
Nancy Pelosi is among the richest members of Congress,[126] with an estimated net worth of approximately $58 million, the 12th highest estimated net worth in Congress, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.[127]
While members of Congress are not required to disclose their exact net worth, organizations such as the Center for Responsive Politics prepare estimated ranges based on public disclosures. The CRP's midpoint estimate of the Pelosis' net worth is $58,436,537 as of 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available, with a possible range from $7 million to $124 million.[128]
Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[129] Additionally, Pelosi served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and continues to be involved in the Foundation today.

University of California, Berkeley","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Lee","Barbara Lee","Democratic","California State Assembly","Baptist - PNBC","Barbara Jean Lee (born July 16, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for California's 13th congressional district, serving East Bay voters from 1998 to 2013 during a time when the region was designated California's 9th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party. She was the first woman to represent the 9th district and is also the first woman to represent the 13th district. Lee was the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and was the Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Lee is notable as the only member of either house of Congress to vote against the authorization of use of force following the September 11, 2001 attacks.[1] This made her a hero among many in the anti-war movement.[2] Lee has been a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and supports legislation creating a Department of Peace.


Lee was born Barbara Jean Tutt in El Paso, Texas, the daughter of Mildred Adaire (ne Parish) and Garvin Alexander Tutt, a Lieutenant Colonel.[3] According to a DNA analysis, she descended primarily from people of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.[4][5] She moved from Texas to California in 1960 with her military family parents, and attended San Fernando High School in San Fernando, California.[6] She was a young single mother of two receiving public assistance when she began attending college.[7][8] Lee was educated at Mills College, and received an MSW from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975.
While a student at Mills College, she was a volunteer at the Oakland chapter of the Black Panther Party's Community Learning Center and worked on Panther co-founder Bobby Seale's 1973 Oakland mayoral campaign.[9] Lee was a staff member for United States Representative Ron Dellums and a member of the California State Assembly and the California State Senate before entering the House. She ran for Congress in a special election that created a year-long series of five special elections as various East Bay politicians vied for political office. (For a detailed account of these elections, see Special election musical chairs.)
Lee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of congress to vote ""No"" on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted overly-broad powers to wage war to the president at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She ""warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.'""[10] Lee explained, ""It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 eventsanywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration.... The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action.""
This vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as ""communist"" and ""traitor"". Many of the responses included death threats against her or her family to the point that the Capitol Police provided round-the-clock plainclothes bodyguards.[11] She was also criticized by politicians and in editorial pages of conservative-leaning newspapers, e.g. John Fund's column in The Wall Street Journal.[12] She was awarded the Sen MacBride Peace Prize by the International Peace Bureau in 2002 for that vote.
She hinted to the Oakland Tribune that she would run for the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus in September 2008, following the end of her four-year term as co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.[13]
Lee's opposition to the death penalty was recognized in 2002 by Death Penalty Focus, when they presented her with the Mario Cuomo Act of Courage Award.[14]
Although Lee is considered a liberal Democrat, she has occasionally split with members of her own party throughout her congressional career, especially on foreign policy matters. She voted in favor of limiting military operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, against authorizing air strikes, and in favor of a Republican-backed plan to completely withdraw U.S. troops from the operation, all in 1999.[15] Lee voted against the Iraq War Resolution in 2002.[16][17][18] Lee was one of only 46 Democrats to vote for the Online Freedom of Speech Act of 2005.[19] Lee was one of only 13 Democrats to vote against an emergency supplemental appropriations bill in 2007 which, among other things, funded the war in Iraq but required withdrawal of U.S. forces to begin by October 1.[20] However, Lee voted in favor of overriding President Bush's veto of the measure on May 2.[21] On November, 2009 Lee was one of 36 representatives to vote ""nay"" on House Resolution 867, which condemned the UN's Goldstone Report.[22] Lee voted to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011.[23][24] Lee also voted in favor of similar resolutions involving troop withdrawal from Pakistan and, most recently, Libya.[25][26] Lee also joined her Republican colleagues, one of 70 Democrats to do so, in voting against a resolution to authorize limited use of force in Libya.[27] Lee was also one of only 36 Democrats to vote in favor of limiting funds appropriated for military operations in Libya.[28]
Lee was one of the 31 who voted in the House to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[29]
Lee is the author of the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act, which would enhance U.S. foreign relations with CARICOM nations. This act directs the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a comprehensive program that extends and expands existing primary and secondary school initiatives in the Caribbean to provide: (1) teacher training methods; and (2) increased community involvement in school activities.[30] The bill is named for former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who helped inspire Lee to become involved in politics when Chisholm ran for the Democratic nomination for President; Lee became the Northern California Chair of the Chisholm campaign.
On September 29, 2008, Lee was one of 95 Democrats to vote against the defeated Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.[31] However, she voted for a modified version on October 3.[32]
Lee was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places restrictions on health insurance plans providing coverage for abortions in the context of the Affordable Health Care for America Act.[33]
As a congresswoman for the Bay Area, Barbara Lee has made affordable housing in East Bay area and beyond a top priority. Barbara has supported and backed legislation meant to expand home ownership opportunities, improve public housing quality, and assist the homeless.[34]
Lee has two grown sons, Tony and Craig, both of whom work in the insurance industry. Tony Lee is the CEO of Dickerson Employee Benefits, one of the nation's largest African-American owned insurance brokerage/consulting firms. Craig Lee is a long term senior executive at State Farm.[35]
Lee endorsed Senator Barack Obama for president in the 2008 primary.[36]
Lee's voting record as a member of the House was ranked by the National Journal in 2007, based on roll-call votes on economic, social and foreign policy issues in 2006. Lee scored an overall 84.3%, meaning she voted with a more liberal stance than 84.3% of the House. National Journal scored Lee as voting 82% liberal on economic issues, 92% liberal on social issues, and 65% liberal on foreign policy. The 92% rating on social issues came from Lee being grouped with 35 other House legislators who all tied for the highest, most liberal ranking.[37] Lee received a 97% progressive rating from ""The Progressive Punch,""[38] and a 4% conservative rating from the American Conservative Union.[39]
In 2003, she was recognized as a Woman of Peace at the Global Exchange Human Rights Awards in San Francisco with Bianca Jagger, Arundhati Roy and Kathy Kelly.[35]
In 2010, Lee took the food stamp challenge and also appeared in the documentary film Food Stamped.[35]
In 2014, Lee received endorsements from the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, Feminist Majority Political Action Committee, J Street PAC, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Sierra Club, and United Auto Workers.[40]"

Speier was born in 1950 in San Francisco, and grew up in an apolitical, working-class family, the daughter of Nancy (ne Kanchelian) and Manfred ""Fred"" Speier.[4] Her mother was of Armenian descent, while her father was an immigrant from Germany. Speier took Jacqueline as her confirmation name after Jackie Kennedy.[5] She is a graduate of Mercy High School in Burlingame. (Her daughter graduated from there in 2012.) She earned a B.A. from the University of California, Davis, and a J.D. from the University of California Hastings College of the Law in 1976.[6]
She married Dr. Steven Sierra, an emergency room doctor, in 1987.[7][8] They had a son Jackson Kent, born in 1988 while she was serving as a member of the California State Assembly.[9] Her husband died in a car accident in 1994 at the age of 53.[7] At the time, Jackie was two months pregnant with their second child, a daughter she named Stephanie.[9]
In 2001 Speier married Barry Dennis, an investment consultant.[7][10]
Speier entered politics by serving as a congressional staffer for Congressman Leo Ryan. Speier was part of his November 1978 fact-finding mission organized to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by the Reverend Jim Jones and his Peoples Temple followers, almost all of whom were American citizens who had moved to Jonestown, Guyana, with Jones in 1977 and 1978.[5] Speier was one of two members of the mission who made wills before traveling to Jonestown.[11] Several Peoples Temple members ambushed the investigative team and others boarding the plane to leave Jonestown on November 18. Five people died, including Congressman Ryan. While trying to shield herself from rifle and shotgun fire behind small airplane wheels with the other members of the team, Speier was shot five times and waited 22 hours before help arrived.[12] That same day, over 900 of the remaining members of the Peoples Temple died in Jonestown and Georgetown in a mass murder-suicide.
Speier's own political career began with an unsuccessful run to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Congressman Ryan (the seat she holds now).[5] She lost the Democratic primary to another former Ryan staffer, G. W. ""Joe"" Holsinger. He lost to the Republican candidate Bill Royer, San Mateo County Supervisor.
Speier won her first election in 1980, when she ran for the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors and defeated a 20-year incumbent. At the time, she was the youngest person ever elected to the board. She was reelected in 1984, and was later selected as chairwoman.[12]
In 1986, midway through her second term on the Board of Supervisors, she ran for the California State Assembly from a district in northern San Mateo County. She won by a few hundred votes. She was reelected five more times, the last as the nominee of both the Democratic and Republican parties.[13]
California state term limits forced Speier to give up her Assembly seat in 1996, but in 1998 she was elected to the California State Senate. In 2002, she was elected to a second term with 78.2% of the vote.[14] As a state senator, Speier was instrumental in securing $127 million funding for major service improvements to Caltrain, for which the commuter rail agency named a new locomotive (no. 925) for her. Speier also focused on representing consumer rights.[15] Senator Speier was termed out of the California State Senate in 2006. Speier served as assistant president pro tempore of the California State Senate during her last term.
In 2006, Speier ran in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant governor of California against insurance commissioner John Garamendi and state senator Liz Figueroa. At the June 6, 2006, elections, Speier was defeated by Garamendi in a close race. Garamendi received 42.9%, Speier received 39.3%, and Figueroa received the remaining 17.8% of the vote.
Speier endorsed Hillary Clinton's bid for president.[16]
On January 13, 2008, Speier announced she was running in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, Ryan's old district. The seat was being vacated by 14-term incumbent and fellow Democrat Tom Lantos, who announced on January 2, 2008, that he was not seeking re-election. Speier had spent much of 2007 building support to challenge Lantos in the Democratic primary.[17]
On January 17, 2008, Lantos endorsed Speier as his successor. She also picked up endorsements from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Congressman Mike Thompson and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.
Lantos died February 11, 2008. Speier won a special primary election on April 8, 2008, to fill the remainder of his term, which ended in January 2009. She won an outright majority, avoiding a runoff that would have been held on June 3, coinciding with the regular primary election.[18] Speier easily won the Democratic primary on June 3. The then-12th, now-14th was so heavily Democratic that this virtually assured her of a full term.[19] She was elected to a full term in November with 75 percent of the vote, and has been reelected two more times with no substantive opposition.
On July 11, 2008, Speier introduced her first bill, the Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act, which would set a national speed limit of 60mph in urban areas and 65mph on less-populated stretches of highway.
Speier supports legal abortion. When she took the National Political Awareness Test in 2002, she answered, Abortions should always be legally available.[20] The organization NARAL Pro-Choice America rated Jackie Speier as 100% on interest group ratings because she supported the choice of abortion in her voting for legislation.[21] Also, in 2008 the Planned Parenthood Organization gave Speier a 100% on her actions regarding abortion.[20] In a speech on the House floor on February 17, 2011, Speier said that she herself had undergone an emergency D&E procedure when complications developed in a wanted pregnancy.[22][23]
Speier believes in a stricter view of gun control. According to her answers on the NPAT (National Political Awareness Test) she would like to require safety locks on all guns and background checks on prospective buyers as well as ban certain guns (other than for hunting) and strengthen state restrictions on buying and owning guns.[20] To show that her legislation currently follows what she answered on the NPAT, when the Gun Owners of America graded Jackie Speier, they gave her an ""F"" grade and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Jack Berman Advocacy Center gave her a 100%.[20][21] The National Rifle Association (NRA) and Gun Owners of California also gave Speier a low grade on gun rights.[20]
Speier is concerned for the protection of the environment and wants to preserve the health of this planet. She lists as evidence the decline of salmon on the West Coast as proof of global warming.[24] Speier believes global warming poses a growing danger and negatively affects the environment. When she spoke to the House on the subject of global warming and the environment, she expressed a desire to craft a bipartisan and commonsense energy plan that makes polluters pay, provides for middle-class energy tax credits, and creates a new industry and lots of good, clean, green jobs.[25] Jackie Speier is working to improve energy legislation with the Clean Air Rebate Act of 2009, the Home Star Act and the American Clean Energy and Security Act.[26][27]
Speier introduced legislation to enhance information sharing between the Transportation Security Administration and participating mass transit agencies in high-risk jurisdictions. The goal of this expanded relationship would be to thwart terrorist attacks against high-profile transit targets.[28] [29]
Speier supports same-sex marriage. She is a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus.[30]"

University of Maryland School of Law","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Swalwell","Eric Swalwell","Democratic","Dublin City Council","unspecified Christian","Eric Michael Swalwell, Jr. (born November 16, 1980) is an American politician and activist from California, who serves as the U.S. Representative from California's 15th congressional district. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district covers most of eastern Alameda County, including Hayward, Pleasanton, Livermore, Fremont, Dublin and San Ramon. He was elected in November 2012, defeating incumbent Pete Stark, a fellow Democrat almost a half-century Swalwell's senior, who had held the office since 1973. Swalwell took office on January 3, 2013. [2][3][4][5][6]


Swalwell was born in Sac City, Iowa and raised in Dublin, California.[7] He graduated from Dublin High School (Class of 1999).[8]
He attended Campbell University on a soccer scholarship from 1999 to 2001.[9][10] He lost the scholarship after suffering an injury.[7] He then transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park. [9] He received a bachelor's degree in Government and Politics at Maryland, and later earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland School of Law. He served on the College Park, Maryland city council as its student representative.[11]
""I learned to never stop working. Hard work will always be rewarded. Lifes not fair, not everyone starts at the same starting point. We should strive for that, having everyone start at the same place, but I realized other people would have better opportunities because of where they came from in life, and that the only way I could overcome those advantages was to work hard.""[12]
In 2014, Swalwell announced that he will serve as chairman of Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley's O' Say Can You See PAC's Young Professionals Leadership Circle due to his friendship with the governor. He made clear that his support is about the 2014 midterm elections and not an endorsement of a potential presidential bid by O'Malley in 2016. [13]
In 2001 and 2002, Swalwell interned for Ellen Tauscher, a United States Representative, in Washington, D.C., focusing on legislative research and constituent outreach and services.[11] He worked as an Alameda County deputy district attorney, a Dublin planning commissioner, and a Dublin city councilman.[7][14][6]
In September 2011, Swalwell filed papers to run for Congress in the 15th District. The district had previously been the 13th, represented by 20-term incumbent Pete Stark, a fellow Democrat. Stark had represented the district since 1973, seven years before Swalwell had been born. He took a leave of absence from the Dublin city council in order to run for the seat.[7] While he was running for the seat, an attempted recall of Swalwell from the Dublin City Council was begun, but after he won election to US House, the attempt was later abandoned.
Swalwell was endorsed by the San Francisco Chronicle.[14][15] During the 2012 election cycle, Swalwell was accused by the Stark campaign of being a Tea Party candidate. The accusation was refuted by Swalwell and the San Jose Mercury News, which also endorsed Swalwell.[16] Stark refused to debate Swalwell during the campaign. In response to Stark's refusal to debate, Swalwell organized a mock debate with an actor playing Pete Stark, quoting him verbatim when answering the moderator. Other campaign gimmicks included Chinese-manufactured rubber ducks, and a dreadlocked, bearded information man. [17] [18][6] Swalwell was able to contest Stark after the primary due to a new primary system in California, under which the top two vote getters advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.[19]
Swalwell defeated Stark 52.1% to 47.9%. [20]
On December 12, 2013, Swalwell introduced the Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act (H.R. 3771; 113th Congress) into the House.[21] If enacted, the bill would allow Americans to deduct from their 2013 taxes any charitable donations made between January 1, 2014 and April 15, 2014 provide they are made for the relief of victims in the Republic of the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan.[21] The typhoon did an estimated $1 billion in damage and killed thousands of people.[22] Swawell said that ""Typhoon Haiyan devastated many parts of the Philippines and we should make it as easy as possible for Americans who want to assist those affected by the storm.""[22] Swalwell saw the bill as providing ""another incentive for Americans to donate and donate now - when their help is needed most.""[22] On March 25, 2014 this legislation was signed into law by President Obama. On June 17, 2014, as a part of the renaming of multiple post offices around the country, Swalwell introduced HR 1671 to rename the post office in Dublin, CA as the James ""Jim"" Kohnen Post Office. It was voted into law on a unanimous 398-0 vote.
Swalwell has advocated rescinding the No Child Left Behind Act, and increasing funding for education, while decreasing funding for defense. He has also advocated for renewable energy jobs to be created with federal stimulus money. He has stated he would attempt to raise the Social Security cap, with wealthier Americans paying into the program. He has proposed the idea of a ""mobile Congress,"" with members casting votes remotely, while spending more time in their districts.[23] In March 2013, Swalwell led in the writing of an open letter to John S. Pistole, Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), opposing the new policy which would allow passengers to bring knives on board airplanes. [24] He is also a supporter of same-sex marriage and abortion rights. [25]
During a house vote, Swalwell recorded a video of his vote against a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks to his mobile phone and uploaded it to Vine, an internet video service. His posting violated the House rules that state ""No device may be used for still photography or for audio or video recording.""[26] He defended the action, stating ""We operate under rules that were created in the eighteenth century, and I think it's time that the Congress start to act more like regular Americans do."""
"36","","2005","1952","California 16","California State University, Fresno","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Costa","Jim Costa","Democratic","California State Senate, California State Assembly","Roman Catholic","James Manuel ""Jim"" Costa (born April 13, 1952) is the U.S. Representative for California's 16th congressional district, serving in Congress since his initial election in 2004. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district takes in large and predominantly Latino portions of Fresno.


Born in Fresno, Costa is a third-generation family farmer. His grandparents emigrated from Portugal's Azores Islands in the early 20th century. He attended San Joaquin Memorial High School and graduated in the class of 1970. He then graduated in 1974 from Fresno State, where he got initiated into Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He worked as a special assistant to Congressman John Krebs from 1975 to 1976, and as administrative assistant to Assemblyman Richard Lehman from 1976 to 1978.[citation needed]
Costa represented part of Fresno in the state legislature for 24 years, serving in the California State Assembly from 1978 until 1994, and in the California State Senate from 1994 until 2002.
Costa was reportedly a holdout vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in March 2010. He ultimately voted in favor of the legislation.[1] To gain Costa's vote, the House leadership reportedly promised Costa and Dennis Cardoza funding for a medical school for California's Central Valley.[2]
Costa has been an advocate of creating a high-speed rail system that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles-per-hour. He has introduced many bills supporting these rails; so far, none have passed. Miller has compared rail projects to Eisenhower's highway expansion and pleaded to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and President Obama for help in with this project.[3]
In April 2008, Costa wrote a piece in Capitol Weekly calling for high-speed rail in California.[4]
Tens of thousands of minority Laotian- and Hmong-American veterans and their refugee families reside in Congressman Costa's district, having been resettled as political refugees in California-- when they fled persecution from the Marxist regime in communist Laos following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 and the military takeover of the Kingdom of Laos by the Pathet Lao and communist forces from Vietnam. Costa garnered support from this significant Lao- and Hmong-American community in California, in large part, because of his leadership and support for S. 200, ""The Lao Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill,"" co-introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, which would grant burial honors to Lao and Hmong Veterans of the U.S. Secret War in Laos.[5][6] [7][8][9]
Each year, the Fresno-based Lao Veterans of America and The Centre for Public Policy Analysis organize delegations from the Central Valley, and Rep. Costa's district, that travel to Washington, D.C., and Arlington National Cemetery to pay homage at the Laos Memorial and honor the Lao- and Hmong-American veterans, and their American advisers, who served and died with U.S. CIA Central Intelligence Agency clandestine and military forces during the Vietnam War.[10][11][12]
In January 2015, Costa was one of the twenty-eight democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted in favor of building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.
In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th District, which was opened up by the retirement of its seven-term incumbent, Cal Dooley. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced Republican Party state senator Roy Ashburn in November.
The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave Al Gore his highest vote total outside the state's two large conurbations (Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area in the north and Los Angeles and San Diego to the south). Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, ""Costa's going to cost ya,"" and linked him to former Governor Gray Davis, calling them ""two taxing twins"". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican Kings County.
Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the Natural Resources Committee's Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the House Agriculture Committee.
Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.
Costa was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee Andy Vidak. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after Election Day,[13] with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.
For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and Bakersfield. However, redistricting following the 2010 Census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th District, a much more compact district including most of Fresno, as well as most of Merced.[14] He faced Republican Brian Whelan in the general election. After the new districts were announced, it was reported that the NRCC considered Costa vulnerable to defeat.[15]
In November 2011, the League of Conservation Voters ran a series of TV ads in Costa's district criticizing his environmental record.[16] Costa was reelected in 2012 with 54% of the vote.[17]
On November 19, 2014, Costa was declared winner of his district's House election, with a final 1,319-vote lead over Republican challenger Johnny Tacherra.[18]"

The district encompasses all or part of the cities of Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas, Newark, Santa Clara, San Jose, and Sunnyvale. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in Congress since 2001.


A third generation Japanese American (""sansei""), Honda was born in Walnut Grove, California, in 1941.[1] When he was one year old, he and his family were sent to Camp Amache, a Japanese American internment camp in southeastern Colorado.[2][3] In 1953 his family returned to California, where they became strawberry sharecroppers in Blossom Valley in San Jose.[4]
Honda started at Andrew P. Hill High School, then transferred to, and graduated from, San Jos High Academy.[3] He entered San Jos State University, but interrupted his studies from 1965 to 1967 to serve in the United States Peace Corps in El Salvador, where he learned to speak Spanish.[5] He returned to San Jose State, where in 1968 he received a bachelors degree in Biological Sciences and Spanish. He earned a masters degree in Education from San Jose State in 1974. In his 30-year career as an educator, Honda was a science teacher, a principal at two public schools, a school board member, and he conducted educational research at Stanford University.
Hondas wife, Jeanne, was a kindergarten teacher at Baldwin Elementary School in San Jos. She passed away in February 2004.[6] He has two children: Mark, an aerospace engineer, living in Torrence, and Michelle, a marketing and communications manager, in San Jose. Michelle is the mother of one daughter and two sons. In February 2015, Honda's announcement that he is a ""proud jichan"", or grandfather of his transgender granddaughter gained regional, national, and international coverage.[7][8][9][10]
In 1971, San Jose Mayor Norman Mineta appointed Honda to the city's Planning Commission. In 1981, Honda was elected to the San Jose Unified School Board. He was elected to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors in 1990, and to the California State Assembly in 1996, where he served until 2001.
Honda won the Democratic nomination for the 15th District, which had once been represented by Norm Mineta. In 2000, Honda won by a convincing 12-point margin.
In November 2003, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Terry McAuliffe appointed Honda as Deputy Chair of the DNC.
In February 2005, Honda was elected a Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee under the chairmanship of Howard Dean. In 2009, Congressman Honda was reelected for a second term as DNC Vice Chair, under the chairmanship of former Virginia Governor Tim Kaine; he served in this role until 2013.
Due to redistricting after the 2010 US Census, Honda began representing the California's 17th congressional district at the beginning of the 113th Congress on January 3, 2013.
Hondas legislative efforts have focused on many areas, including, but not limited to, education, civil rights, environment, LGBT rights, national service, foreign policy, immigration, transportation, and technology.
From 2001 to 2007 Honda served on the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and was the Ranking Member of its Energy Subcommittee from 2005-2007. He also served on the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure from 2001 to 2007. In 2007, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi appointed Honda to the powerful United States House Committee on Appropriations. From 2011-2013, he was Ranking Member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. From 2001-2003, and again from 2011-2013, Honda also was appointed to serve on the House Budget Committee.
Honda is a member of these and other committees, commissions, and caucuses:
Honda has secured over $1.3 billion in appropriations since 2001.[11]
Some of Hondas most notable appropriations were for the extension of the BART system into Silicon Valley. During his five years on the House Transportation Committee he secured $11 million in direct earmarks attached to a number of bills. Also during his time on that committee he facilitated the BART projects qualification for the New Starts Program, which authorized another $900 million in funds,[12] the first $400 million of which Honda managed to appropriate over the three-year period of FY2012, 13, and 14.
During the 2014 midterm election cycle Honda's opponent Ro Khanna alleged that Honda only secured $2 million for the project.[13] In response to this, a number of local officials including a Congresswoman, a State Senator, a former US Secretary of Transportation, and former and current Valley Transportation Authority chairs, sent the Khanna Campaign an open letter refuting their claims and requesting that they correct their campaign language.[14]
The $11 million in direct appropriations was part of:
The $400 million from the New Starts Program was allocated as follows:
Honda has been a long-time supporter of organized labor, and has supported numerous bills for creating a living wage. In 2013 and 2014, he cosponsored the Original Living American Wage Act (H.R. 229), the WAGES Act (H.R. 650), and the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010), which would raise the federal minimum wage. Honda was also a supporter of the San Joses successful ballot initiative that raised the citys minimum wage to $10 per hour.
As former Chairman of the Afghanistan Taskforce for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and former Co-Chair of the CPCs Peace and Security Taskforce, Congressman Honda has consistently critiqued the war strategy through a series of Congressional briefings, legislation, published opinion pieces (Alternative Strategies to Obamas Afghan Agenda, A Different Kind of Surge), and Congressional letters to the Administration. Honda has advocated an orderly withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan and a significant realignment of U.S. aid to focus on strengthening government institutions, capacity building, economic development, and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. Honda has also criticized the Obama administration for failing to seek Congressional approval for U.S. military operations in Libya.
The Congressman is also critical of the wide-scale use of drones and is a cosponsor of the Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act (H.R. 4372) requiring an annual report on the number of civilians and combatants killed and injured in drone strikes.
In 2008, Congressman Honda worked with then-Senator Barack Obama to introduce the Enhancing STEM Education Act. Honda introduced the House version, H.R. 6104, and Obama introduced the Senate version, S.3047, on the same day.[21][22] The bills sought to enhance the coordination among state and federal governments to improve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by creating a committee on STEM education at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and an Office of STEM at the Department of Education, instituting a voluntary State Consortium on STEM education, and creating a National STEM Education Research Repository. Portions of this bill (notably, creating a committee on STEM education at OSTP), as well as Honda's INVENT Act[23] (which would develop curriculum tools for use in teaching innovation and fostering inventiveness at the K-16 level), were eventually included in the America COMPETES Act reauthorization, which President Obama signed into law on January 4, 2011.[24]
Honda led the Congressional authorization for The Equity and Excellence Commission, a commission that began in 2011 and reported its findings to the Secretary of Education in late 2012. The Commission is a federal advisory committee chartered by Congress, operating under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); 5 U.S.C., App.2.
The goal of the commission was to examine the disparities in meaningful educational opportunities that give rise to the achievement gap, with a focus on systems of finance, and recommend ways in which federal policies could address such disparities.
The commission had 27 members from a range of backgrounds, including education, law, tax, government, business, and civil rights. The committee met 17 times in Washington, DC and across the country.
In November 2012, the commission presented its findings in a report titled For Each and Every Child: A Strategy for Education Equity and Excellence. [25] The findings focused around five recommendations: (1) restructuring the financing of schools, focusing on equitable resources; (2) supporting quality teachers and school leaders; (3) supporting early childhood education; (4) promoting increased parental engagement; and, (5) addressing changes in accountability and governance in the education system.
Honda secured millions of dollars in federal funding for the cleanup and demolition of the former Almaden Air Force Station atop Mt. Umunhum.[26] Contaminated with standard-use hazardous materials during its military use (lead paint, asbestos, etc.), the site was remediated, demolished, and is slated to open for public access in spring 2017. Honda has also advocated for programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
In 2014, Honda introduced the Climate Change Education Act (H.R. 4461),[27] legislation that aims to improving public understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment and the steps that individuals and communities can take to combat the global warming crisis.
Honda has been a defender of the civil rights of American Muslims. Soon after the September 11 attacks in 2001, Honda spoke at a convention of the American Muslim Alliance (AMA) on October 2001.[28] He told those in attendance not to change their identity or name. ""My last name is Honda. You cannot be more Japanese than that."" The congressman remembered what he and especially his parents had to go through when Pearl Harbor was attacked. ""We were taken in a vehicle with windows covered, we had no idea where we were being taken."" Because of that episode in his life, the congressman explained that he understood what the Muslims could be going through in America after the attack on September 11.
In the Quran Oath Controversy of the 110th United States Congress, Rep. Virgil Goode (R-VA) issued a letter to his constituents stating his view that the decision of Representative-elect Keith Ellison (D-MN) to use the Quran in his swearing-in ceremony is a threat to ""the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America... I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies. In response, Honda penned a response to Goode expressing his surprise and offense by that letter and declaring No person should be labeled as un-American based on his or her religion, and it is outrageous to cast aspersions on Representative-elect Ellison purely because of his religious background.[29]
In 2014, Honda introduced the Freedom of Faith Act (H.R. 4460).[30] The Act would make permanent the special immigrant provision for non-minister religious workers, which is set to expire in 2015. Honda also urged President Obama to convene the first ever White House Summit on Religious Diversity.
In 2007, Honda voted for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which was the legislative response to the Jack Abramoff scandal and introduced comprehensive new transparency requirements for lobbyists and for Members of Congress. In 2012, he cosponsored H.R. 1148, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which criminalized insider trading by Members of Congress and required numerous disclosures.[31] He voted for H.Res. 895, which created the first-ever independent ethics office, the Office of Congressional Ethics.
Honda has advocated for the expansion of health coverage for all through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is a big proponent of the public option. As the Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Honda was successful in ensuring that the ACA addressed racial and ethnic health disparities, including improvements in data collection, and measures to increase the number of health care providers from different backgrounds.
As the Chairman and Chair Emeritus of Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, he sponsored and supported the Health Care Equality and Accountability Act, which would have expanded access to care for individuals with limited English proficiency, increased health workforce diversity, and encouraged further studies on the minority health issues. As a member of the TriCaucus with the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Honda has introduced legislation focused on health disparities in correlation to an annual health disparities summit.
Honda has led efforts to address tuberculosis by seeking changes to the Centers of Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) formula for direct funding for tuberculosis treatment and education to include highly impacted counties. He was successful in getting report language in the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Bill to have the CDC review its funding distribution policies.
Honda has been a leader in Congress for viral hepatitis and founded and co-chairs the Congressional Viral Hepatitis Caucus.

Honda has supported mobile health technology innovation and introduced the Health Care Innovation and Marketplace Technologies Act of 2013 (H.R. 2363).[35] This bill establishes an Office of Wireless Health at the FDA,[36] award grant for the development of effective product, process, or structure that enhances the use, particularly by patients, of health information technology, and provides medical professionals tax incentives to implement qualified health information technology in their practices.
Honda has been an advocate for womens health including supporting provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act such as the elimination of gender-based discrimination in insurance prices, recognizing that being a woman is not a preexisting condition that should force women to pay higher premiums. Honda fought against the StupakPitts Amendment, which would have prohibited the use of federal funds ""to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion"" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. Through his role in the House Appropriations Committee, he has consistently supported funding Title Xthe only federal grant program that is completely devoted to providing comprehensive family planning and other preventive health services. He has also secured funding for projects that promote womens and childrens health and wellbeing, such as mobile mammography units, youth mentoring grants, and child obesity programs.
Honda has supported Medicare and Medicaid programs throughout his career, fighting for the health rights of seniors and low-income families. He introduced the Peoples Budget, the Congressional Progressive Caucus 2012 budget alternative, which would keep Medicare and Medicaid solvent while closing the national debt within 10 years.[37] Honda supports the permanent repeal of the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) and cosponsored the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015) which would have repealed the SGR and improved the physician payment system to reward value over volume.
On the issue of comfort women, in 2007 Honda proposed US H.Res. 121, which stated that Japan should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner, refute any claims that the issue of comfort women never occurred, and educate current and future generations ""about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the 'comfort women'.""[38] Honda has stated, ""the purpose of this resolution is not to bash or humiliate Japan.""
On July 30, 2007, the House of Representatives passed Honda's resolution after 30 minutes of debate, in which no opposition was voiced. Honda was quoted on the floor as saying, ""We must teach future generations that we cannot allow this to continue to happen. I have always believed that reconciliation is the first step in the healing process.""
Honda later secured report language in the Fiscal Year 2014 Consolidated Appropriation Act (submitted July 2013) urging the Secretary of State to encourage the Government of Japan to address issues raised in H.Res.121. President Obama signed the spending bill into law on January 17, 2014.
Honda works on the elimination of human trafficking. He cosponsored the Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination Act of 2013 (H.R. 3344).[39] The bill address predatory recruiters who use international labor recruitment as a human trafficking medium. On January 23, 2014, Honda hosted a training at the San Jose International Airport for airport and airline employees on how to detect signs of human trafficking.
Honda is a cosponsor of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (H.R. 15), which entails comprehensive immigration reform to increase high skill visas, reunite families, and provide a pathway to citizenship for those living in the shadows.[40]
Honda has been recognized as a long-time supporter of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, with a 100% scorecard rating from the Human Rights Campaign since 2001.[41] HRC endorsed Honda for his 2014 reelection. In the 1990s, he supported same-sex partner benefits as a Santa Clara County Supervisor. In 2008, he was a co-founder of the Congressional Equality Caucus, when there were only two openly gay Members of Congress.[42] He opposed the use of taxpayer funds to protect the Defense of Marriage Act in the Supreme Court.
In 2013, Honda worked with Mayor of Campbell Evan Low to raise awareness for the ban against blood donations from gay and bisexual men.[43] In 2015, Honda revealed in a speech at the event Courageous Conversation, a one-day symposium that addresses how administrators can work to make their schools safer for their students, that his granddaughter was transgender. ""As both an individual, and as an educator, I have experienced and witnessed bullying in its many forms. And as the proud jichan, or grandpa, of a transgender grandchild, I hope that my granddaughter can feel safe going to school without fear of being bullied. I refuse to be a bystander while millions of people are dealing with the effects of bullying on a daily basis.""[7]
In 2013, Honda introduced the Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act (H.R. 615), one of the main bills in the Democratic Partys Make it in America Agenda, which would create a commission of private-sector experts to designate market-changing technologies.[44] These technologies would be eligible for a consumer tax credit as long as they are made in the United States.
Honda also introduced the Scaling Up Manufacturing Act (H.R. 616).[45] The bill would provide companies a 25% tax credit on the costs associated with building their first manufacturing facility in the United States.
He has been a vocal supporter of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation proposed by President Obama to help revitalize American manufacturing. He is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Revitalizing American Manufacturing Innovation Act (H.R. 2996) and has urged President Obama to locate a manufacturing hub in Silicon Valley to focus on the domestic development of the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing tools.
Honda has used his position as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee to prioritize funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technologys Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program which works with small and medium-sized manufacturers to help them create and retain jobs, increase profits, and save time and money.[46]
As the Representative for the heart of Silicon Valley, Honda has been intimately involved in technology and nanotechnology policy for many years. He has supported the principle of network neutrality, and is a cosponsor of the Open Internet Preservation Act (H.R. 3982).[47]
Honda has also been critical of the National Security Agencys surveillance of electronic communications as a violation of privacy. He is an original cosponsor of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet Collection, and Online Monitoring Act (USA FREEDOM ACT - H.R 3361) which seeks to rein in the dragnet collection of data by the NSA, increase transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, provide businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA requests, and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue cases before the FISC. Honda has been a proponent of government intelligence transparency and has pushed to require that top-line intelligence spending be disclosed during annual budget submission to Congress through his cosponsorship of the Intelligence Budget Transparency Act (H.R. 3855).
In 2002, he introduced one of the first nanotechnology bills in Congress, the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002,[48] which sought to establish a Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board to advise the President on a range of policy matters. Such a board was recommended by the National Research Council in its review of the National nanotechnology Initiative, Small Wonders, Endless Frontiers.
In 2003, he worked with then-Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY), to introduce the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003.[49] This bill authorized federal investments in nanotechnology research and development, restructured the National Nanotechnology Initiative to improve interagency coordination and the level of input from outside experts in the field, and laid the path to address novel social, ethical, philosophical, legal, environmental health issues that might arise. H.R. 766 was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7, 2003, signed into law on December 3, 2003, and to date has been funded at nearly $4 billion.
Honda continued his interest in nanotechnology by convening the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology with then-controller Steve Westly in 2005.[50] This group met numerous times to discuss and develop strategies to promote the San Francisco Bay Area and all of California as the national and worldwide center for nanotechnology research, development and commercialization. Under the direction of Working Chair Scott Hubbard, then-Director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center, the Task Force spent a year developing recommendations that would assure California a leading position in what could be a trillion-dollar economic sector. The recommendations were included in the BRTFN report, Thinking Big About Thinking Small.
Honda developed two pieces of legislation based on the report: 1) the Nanomanufacturing Investment Act of 2005[51] and 2) the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act.[52] Many provisions of these bills were included in larger pieces of legislation, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009[53] and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, that passed the House of Representatives in the 111th Congress.[54]
Congressman Honda's accomplishments in the field of nanotechnology policy has been recognized by the Foresight Institute, which awarded him its Foresight Institute Government Prize in 2006.[55]
Congressman Honda has supported expanding and making permanent the Research and Development tax credit, and in the 113th Congress is a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014.[56] He has called the research credit, the best incentive in the tax code to ensure that companies continue to conduct their R&D in the U.S.
Honda has been a vocal advocate for expanding the Social Security program. In the 113th Congress, Honda introduced H.R. 3118, the Strengthening Social Security Act, with Congresswoman Linda Sanchez (D-CA) and Congressman Rush Holt (D-NJ), which would increase benefits for current beneficiaries, eliminate the cap on how much of an individuals earnings can be paid into Social Security, change the benefits formula to increase payments by about $70 a month, and adopt a higher cost of living adjustment called CPI-E, designed to reflect the cost of healthcare for seniors.
Also in the 113th Congress, Honda authored H.R. 4202, the CPI-E Act of 2014, which would apply CPI-E to index federal retirement programs other than Social Security, to include programs such as civil service retirement, military retirement, Supplemental Security Income, veterans pensions and compensations, and other retirement programs with COLAs triggered directly by Social Security or civil service retirement. As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Budget Taskforce, Honda also inserted this CPI-E provision into the FY 2015 CPC Budget, entitled the Better Off Budget. Honda said during floor debate on the CPC budget, that the provision was intended to be a first step to applying CPI-E to all federal retirement programs, including Social Security.
Honda has been a leading voice to overhaul and improve the current VA system. As an appropriator, he worked with his colleagues in both parties to not only call for change, but to provide funds to create a new electronic health record program between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. He is also working to ensure that the government makes use of the knowledge and experience of health information technology experts, such as those in Silicon Valley, to ensure this new platform will eliminate the current backlog of claims.
Honda helped obtain $2.8 million in grants to aid homeless and at-risk veterans and their families in Silicon Valley.
Honda has a 100% legislative score from Planned Parenthood[57] and from the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and has been a long-time supporter of pro-choice legislation and for womens health. Honda has supported Paycheck Fairness Act and voted for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Actthe first piece of legislation to signed by President Barack Obama in 2009.
During the debate over the new health care bill, Honda voted against the Stupak Amendment, which would have limited a womans ability to purchase coverage for reproductive health services with her own money.
In 2013, he voted for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which included updated protections for Native American women, immigrant women, and provided specialized support and resources for LGBT, religious and ethnic communities. VAWA reauthorization also included the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which Honda has also supported. Honda introduced the Domestic Violence Judicial Support Act of 2013, which would strengthen the judicial programs that comprise the basis of VAWA.
To support full implementation of the Obama Administrations Executive Order 13595 and the U.S. National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security, and to secure Congressional oversight, Honda introduced the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2013, along his female colleagues, Congresswomen Jan Schakowsky, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Niki Tsongas."

Menlo College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Eshoo","Anna Eshoo","Democratic","San Mateo County Board of Supervisors","Chaldean Catholic","Anna Georges Eshoo (born December 13, 1942) is the U.S. Representative for California's 18th congressional district, serving in Congress since 1993. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, which includes part of Silicon Valley, includes the cities of San Jose, Redwood City, Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto. She is the only Member of Congress of Assyrian descent. Both she and Jackie Speier have Armenian descent on their maternal side and are the only two members of Congress of Armenian descent.


Anna Eshoo was born in New Britain, Connecticut, of Assyrian and Armenian heritage.[3] Her father, Fred Georges, was a jeweler and watchmaker. She is a Chaldean Catholic[citation needed] and is the oldest of three children. She has a brother, Frederick Kenneth Georges, and a sister, Veronica May Georges.
She earned an Associate of Arts degree in English from Caada College in 1975. She worked for the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) between 1963 and 1966 and for Arcata National Corporation between 1966 and 1970.
She was Chair of the San Mateo Democratic Party between 1978 and 1982. She was also a member of the Democratic National Committee in the 1980s. She was Chief-of-Staff to Speaker pro tempore Leo McCarthy of the California State Assembly between 1981 and 1982. She was elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors in 1982 and served until 1992. She was president of the board in 1986.
In the middle of Eshoo's second term on the San Mateo Board of Supervisors, she ran for Congress in California's 12th congressional district. She won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 43%,[4] but lost the general election to Republican Stanford law professor Tom Campbell, 51% 46%.[5]
Campbell gave up his congressional seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate, and Eshoo entered the Democratic primary for the open seat, which had been renumbered as the 14th District. She won the seven-way primary with a plurality of 40%.[6] In the general election, she defeated Republican nominee Tom Huening 57% 39%.[7]
She survived the Republican Revolution, winning re-election with 61% of the vote.[8]
During this time period, she never won re-election with less than 65% of the vote.
She won re-election against Republican Ronny Santana 70% 22%.[9]
She won re-election against Republican Dave Chapman 69% 28%.[10]
After redistricting, Eshoo ran for and won re-election in California's 18th congressional district based in San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties.[11]
After a bitter race that brought to the fore some dissatisfaction over party leadership, Eshoo lost a party vote for the Democrat who will serve as ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Nancy Pelosi had said Eshoo's elevation to the top Democratic spot on that committee would be important for the Democrats, allowing Eshoo ""to tap into lucrative fundraising interests in Silicon Valley and elsewhere that the committee has jurisdiction."" [12]
In 2003, Eshoo was elected by her Democratic colleagues in the 108th Congress as an At-Large Democratic Whip, and she has served in that position to the present.
On January 30, 2008, Rep. Eshoo formally endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama for President.[13]
In 2005, Eshoo worked with Nancy Pelosi to develop the Democratic Innovation Agenda, which calls for America to achieve independence from Middle East oil over the next ten years. She has led efforts to raise fuel standards for automakers, and pursued reliance on alternative energy sources both in California and nationally.[14] Legislation includes:

Eshoo is a strong supporter of the gay rights movement. In 1992 when a gay bashing mailer was directed at Supervisor Tom Nolan (the first openly gay supervisor in San Mateo and her opponent for her congressional seat) Eshoo stood fast in defending him, his record and years of service. She opposed the Marriage Protection Amendment and the Marriage Protection Act. Her website says the bill is ""discriminatory, singling out for the first time a minority to prevent their interests from being considered by the highest courts in the land.""[16]
As one of just two Assyrian members of Congress, Eshoo has worked hard to protect indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq from continuing religious persecution and political exclusion. She authored an amendment to H.R. 2601, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, requesting that ""special attention should be paid to the welfare of Chaldo-Assyrians and other indigenous Christians in Iraq.""[17]
Rep. Eshoo has been a strong supporter of the Congressional resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide. She also supports closer ties between Armenia and the U.S.
Rep. Eshoo has fought strongly against certain provisions of the Patriot Act, particularly Section 215 (Access to Business Records), which gives federal investigators the right to obtain any tangible business record without obtaining a subpoena.[citation needed]
Rep. Eshoo also introduced ""Kevin's Law,"" which would have given the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat.
As an Assyrian and Armenian American, Rep. Eshoo is co-chair and co-founder of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus. She also serves on the Board of Advisors of THE INSTITUTE on Religion and Public Policy, a freedom of religion organization.
Rep. Eshoo has worked to create a legal ""pathway to citizenship"" for foreign workers of all kinds, from doctors and computer programmers to migrant farm workers. She has voted to increase the annual cap on H-1B visas to allow more temporary foreign professionals to work in the United States (especially those with Master's Degrees or higher).
In her state of California, where as much as 90% of the agricultural workforce is composed of illegal immigrants,[18] Rep. Eshoo cosponsored H.R. 371, the Agricultural Jobs Act, which would confer blue card status on illegal immigrants who had worked an agricultural job in the United States for 150 days or more. This bill never became law.
Other legislation includes:
In November 2005, Rep. Eshoo led the House Democratic Caucus in introducing the ""Innovation Agenda."" Representative Eshoo developed this comprehensive policy in conjunction with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and others after extensive consultation with Silicon Valley and tech leaders around the country, venture capitalists, and scholars.
She authored a bill authorizing electronic signatures and introduced controversial legislation to help alleviate the proliferation of unsolicited email, known as spam. The U.S. House of Representatives passed The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (S. 877), which authorizes a Do Not Spam list, regulates commercial email, and imposes fines on spammers. Eshoo authored the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act of 2001 (H.R. 237), created a program to provide discounts to schools and libraries for Internet access, and authored the Computer Donation Incentive Act.
Rep. Eshoo introduced HR 2428, the Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2009.[19] The bill would require new federal road projects to include plastic conduits buried along the side of the roadway, and enough of them to ""accommodate multiple broadband providers.""[20] According to industry experts, more than half of the cost of new broadband deployment is attributable to the expense of tearing up and repaving roads, said Rep. Eshoo. By putting the broadband conduit in place while the ground beneath the roadways is exposed, we will enable any authorized communications provider to come in later and install fiber-optic cable at far less cost.[19] The bill is supported by Google.[21][22]
Together with Rep. Edward Markey Eshoo introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009,[23] which would make Net Neutrality the law.[24]
Rep. Eshoo currently serves as co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, a bipartisan group of over 150 members of the House and Senate working to educate their colleagues about the promise and potential of the Internet.[25]
Eshoo supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.[26] The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.[27] Eshoo expected Senate support for the bill, saying that they ""shouldn't find it menacing"" and arguing that the bill ""is about the functioning of the FCC in the 21st century.""[28]
Eshoo created student advisory boards in 1993 consisting of youth from her congressional district, who advise her on policies and make recommendations, and are located in Palo Alto, San Mateo and Santa Cruz. The students attend biweekly meetings and choose one topic to focus on each year. Past topics have included health care, the crisis in Darfur, medicine, voter reform, foreign affairs, and the media. Eshoo also hosts a congressional arts competition, which students can apply to win.
She was married to attorney George Eshoo and is now divorced, with two children, Karen and Paul. She now resides in Atherton, California."

She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is based in San Jose.
She is the ranking member on both the House Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight, and on the House Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement.


A Bay Area resident, Lofgren attended Gunn High School (1966) in Palo Alto,[4] and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the Junior State of America, a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.[5] She earned her B.A. at Stanford University (1970) and a J.D. at Santa Clara University School of Law (1975).[2]
In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.[4]
Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in Edwards' district office, while at the same time earning her law degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to a community college board, then to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, where she served for 13 years.[citation needed]
In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor Tom McEnery. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993 and has been the 16th since 1993). She has been reelected eight times with no substantive opposition.[citation needed]
In 2002, Susan Lindauer, a journalist and antiwar activist, worked for Lofgren as her press secretary for two months.[6] Lofgren was a member of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time.[6] Lindauer was later charged with spying for the Iraqi Intelligence Service prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[7] She was arrested in 2004, incarcerated in 2005, and released the next year.[7][8]
In 2006, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) reported that Lofgren had paid her husband's firm, Collins and Day, $285,481 in campaign payments over the prior six years for accounting, fundraising, and regulatory compliance services, and her campaign had paid John Marshall Collins PC, a second company controlled by her husband, $62,705 for rent and office services.[9]
Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the Secure Communities deportation program.[10]
Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the House Ethics Committee. In doing so, she presided over a rare sanction of censure, against long-time member Charles B. Rangel.[11]
In the Stop Online Piracy Act House Judiciary Committee hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill. She has also opposed the data retention requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011).[12]
In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.[13]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. He was elected to Congress in a 1993 special election when longtime Democratic Rep. Leon Panetta resigned to become Director of the Office of Management and Budget.


Farr was born in San Francisco, the son of Janet E. (ne Haskins) and Frederick Sharon ""Fred"" Farr. One of his maternal great-grandfathers was acting mayor of Los Angeles William Hartshorn Bonsall, and one of his paternal great-great-grandfathers was the brother of Nevada Senator William Sharon.[2] He grew up in Carmel, where he still lives. His father was a California state senator for many years. Farr was educated at Willamette University, Santa Clara University and the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
He is married to Shary and has one daughter, Jessica. He is grandfather to two: Ella and Zach.[citation needed]
Farr joined the Peace Corps in 1964 and served for two years as a volunteer in Colombia. He spent his time in a poor barrio near Medellin, teaching community development skills.[3]
While he was serving in Colombia, Farrs mother died from cancer. Following her death, his father visited with Farrs sisters. While riding horses, one of his sisters (Nancy), was thrown and hit her head. She died on the operating table in a Colombian hospital.[citation needed]
Since his Peace Corps service ended, Farr has visited Colombia several times. He took his wife for their honeymoon and has returned several other times for both personal and official business. During a trip in 2007, Farr spoke in front of the Colombian Congress and was awarded the Orden del Congreso de Colombia.[4]
Farrs public service career began in the California Assembly, where he worked as a staffer on budget issues for a decade. In 1975, he ran for and won a seat on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors.
In 1980 he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he became a champion for the organics industry and wrote one of the countrys strictest oil spill liability laws. He served in the Assembly until his election to Congress in 1993.[citation needed]
Farr was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 through a special election when former Congressman Leon Panetta resigned to become President Clintons budget director. Farr was elected to his first full term in 1994.
Farr is active in several congressional caucuses, including the House Oceans Caucus, the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, the Congressional Bike Caucus, the Congressional Organic Caucus, the International Conservation Caucus, and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.[7]
He serves as co-chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus with Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Florida). Farr has taken an active role in supporting the travel industry, boosting membership in the caucus to more than 100 and hosting caucus events, including a June 2008 gathering of travel executives and congressional leaders, the Economic Roundtable: Travels Significance to the U.S. Economy.[8][9]
Farr is also active as co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, which he co-chairs with four other members of Congress. Each year the caucus helps sponsor Capitol Hill Oceans Week, known as CHOW, which draws hundreds of ocean experts from across the country. He is also co-chair of the Congressional Organic Caucus and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.
Farr serves on the House Democracy Assistance Commission, a group established by the House of Representatives mandated to work with emerging democracies throughout the world. The group engages in peer-to-peer cooperation to build technical expertise in partner legislatures that will enhance accountability, transparency, legislative independence, access to information, and government oversight.[10]
Farr is also the former chairman of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation, the largest state delegation in Congress.[citation needed]
On February 26, 2008, at the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Farr said ""the public image of (the ICE agents)"" has become ""not (a) compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a Gestapo-type agency that is knocking down doors""[16] when conducting raids on illegal immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Julie Myers responded to Farr's comments by saying, ""We are not the Gestapo. The men and women of this agency have a very difficult job...and I think they do that with distinction and great honor."".[17] Farr replied that he knew and appreciated this, but reiterated that there is ""there is a very ill will public opinion in the counties (he) represent(s), about ICE"".
On July 12, 2007, Farr joined 11 cosponsors (18 as of August 15, 2007) of H.Res. 333, introduced in Congress, that lays out three articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney. The bill maintains that the vice president purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States (1) by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and (2) about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests and (3) that Cheney has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States. (see http://thomas.loc.gov for more details on H.Res. 333)
""Many residents in the Central Coast support the removal of Cheney from office, and I am proud to represent their values in Congress,"" Farr said in a brief statement.[18]
On July 30, 2007, Farr received the Senator David Pryor Special Achievement Award for his ongoing advocacy for communities with military bases presented by the Association of Defense Communities. The award is given to an individual who advocates for communities with active or closed military bases. ""Communities with active or closed military bases face many special concerns, from land use to economic development to ordnance disposal,"" said Farr. ""I have been lucky enough to assist in the transition efforts at Fort Ord, and that experience has helped me push those issues locally and nationwide."" As vice-chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Farr successfully increased clean-up funds from $221 million to $271 million for military bases closed prior to 2005 [11]."

Valadao was born and raised in Hanford, California. His parents are Portuguese immigrants. He graduated from Hanford High School in 1995, and attended the College of the Sequoias in Visalia. He currently serves as the managing partner of Valadao Dairy, which he owns with his brothers.[3] He has also been a member of the California Milk Advisory Board, Western States Dairy Trade Association, and Regional Leadership Council Chairman for Land O' Lakes.[4]
Valadao announced his candidacy for California's 30th State Assembly district following the retirement of Republican Assemblyman Danny Gilmore in 2010. He defeated Stephanie Campbell in the Republican primary 78%-22%.[5] In the general election, he defeated Shafter Mayor Fran Florez 61%-39%.[6][7]
Valadao announced in August 2011 that he would seek the Republican nomination for California's 21st congressional district.[8] In the June 5 open primary, he ranked first with 57% of the vote, ahead of Democrat John Hernandez - the head of the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce - and Fresno city councilman Blong Xiong.[9] In the November 6 election, he defeated Hernandez by a margin of 58%-42%.[10] His campaign victory in a district that had long been held by Democrats was cited in an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal as a potential template for the GOP, while other analysts cited his opponent's ""weakness as a candidate and a campaigner"" as playing a major role.[11]
Valadao ran for reelection in November 2014. His challengers were Democrat Amanda Renteria, a former political aide for Dianne Feinstein and Debbie Stabenow,[12] and John Hernandez, the Democratic nominee whom he defeated in 2012.[13] In the June 3 primary, he ranked first once again with 63% of the vote, and received majorities of 60% or higher in every county except for Kern. In the November 4 general election, Valadao won reelection to his second term with nearly 60% of the vote.[14]
Valadao was one of the first House Republicans to publicly fight for comprehensive immigration reform.[2] In August 2014, Valadao broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.[15]
In July 2013, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an ethics complaint against Valadao for allegedly failing to disclose the impact that his opposition to proposed high-speed rail routes would have on the value of Valadao Dairy properties.[16][17] In November 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics voted 6-0 to recommend that the House Ethics Committee dismiss the allegation because there is not a substantial reason to believe that a violation of House rules and standards of conduct occurred. In February 2014, the House Ethics Committee formally dismissed the complaint.[18]
In September 2013, in response to threats of a government shutdown over defunding of the Affordable Care Act, Valadao cosponsored the Government Shutdown Fairness Act, which would prevent all members of Congress from receiving their salaries if a shutdown occurred.[19] Valadao himself is the poorest member of Congress, with over $12 million in loans to his family's dairy farm.[20]
The Fresno Bee reported in September 2013 that ""Valadao was one of only 15 House Republicans to vote against a GOP bill that makes deep cuts in food stamp spending.""[21]
On July 31, 2014, Valadao, along with Stevan Pearce of New Mexico, co-sponsored H.R. 5328 by representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, which aimed at prohibiting application of preexisting condition exclusions, under the Public Health Service Act.[22]
In August 2014, the United States Chamber of Commerce awarded Valadao its Spirit of Enterprise Award.[2]
In September 2014, Valadao formally invited Vice President Joe Biden to come to the valley and survey the damage caused by a severe drought. Instead, Biden came on October 7 to hold a fundraising rally for Valadao's opponent, Amanda Renteria.[23][24]

Cal Poly University, San Luis Obispo","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Nunes","Devin Nunes","Republican","California State Director for the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Section","Roman Catholic","Devin Gerald Nunes, OIH, (born October 1, 1973) is the U.S. Representative for California's 22nd congressional district, serving since 2003. The district, numbered as the 21st District from 2003 to 2013, is located in the San Joaquin Valley and includes most of western Tulare County, as well as much of eastern Fresno County. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is also the author of the book Restoring the Republic, published by WND Books in September 2010. Time magazine named Nunes one of the rising stars of American politics under 40, in their list of 40 under 40; that is, the top forty civic leaders under 40 years of age.[1] Nunes is a member of two committees in the House of Representatives: Ways and Means, where he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he is chairman.[2] He was co-chair of the Brazil Caucus and the U.S.-Mexico Friendship Caucus.


Nunes was born in Tulare, California, the oldest of two sons born to Anthony and Diane Nunes[1]. His family has operated a farm in Tulare County for three generations. The Nunes family is of Portuguese descent, immigrating from the Azores to California.[3]
Nunes graduated from Tulare Union High School. He is the second member of Congress to attend Tulare Union, following Olympic gold medalist Bob Mathias three decades later, who served in House of Representatives from 1967 to 1975. After associate's work at College of the Sequoias, Nunes graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he received a bachelor's degree in agricultural business and a master's degree in agriculture.
Nunes was first elected to public office when he was 22 years old. He unseated an 18-year incumbent for a seat on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the College of the Sequoias, earning 65 percent of the vote.[4] He served as a trustee from 1996 to 2002.[5] In 2001, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as California State Director for the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development section. He left this post later in the year to run for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new California district created through reapportionment after the 2000 United States census. Before 2002, the 21st congressional district was part of three districts represented respectively by Bill Thomas, Cal Dooley, and George Radanovich.
Nunes' principal opponents in the crowded seven-way 2002 Republican primary were former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson and state Assemblyman Mike Briggs. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County, while Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical; 42% of the district's population was in Fresno County and 58% in Tulare County.[6] Patterson and Briggs split the vote in Fresno County, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. In addition to Patterson and Briggs splitting Fresno County's vote, Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district.[7] He won the endorsement of the California Farm Bureau and the Fresno Bee.[6] This district is solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November. He has been reelected five times against only nominal Democratic opposition. During the June 8, 2010, California primary, Nunes actually received more write-in votes in the Democratic primary than the Democratic write-in candidate.[8][9] He ran unopposed in the 2010 general election.
Nunes' district was renumbered as the 22nd District after the 2010 census. It lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District, and became plurality-Hispanic. Based on 2014 elections results, it remains predominately Republican.
During 108th Congress, Nunes' first term in Congress, he served on the House Resources Committee, where he was chairman of its National Parks Subcommittee. He was also a member of the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs committees. In the 109th Congress, Nunes was named to the House Ways and Means Committee. In January 2013, Nunes was named chairman of the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee.[10] He was also a member of the House Budget Committee during the 111th Congress. For the 112th United States Congress, Nunes was named to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was named chairman in the 114th Congress by Speaker John Boehner.
In 2003, Nunes became a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, a caucus of Republican Members of Congress of Hispanic and Portuguese descent.
On May 1, 2011, Nunes with the other members of the San Joaquin Valley's Republican Congressional Delegation introduced the San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act to restore the flow of water to the San Joaquin Valley. Water restrictions have been in place to enforce the Endangered Species Act, which has seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years. The result has been what Nunes terms a ""man-made drought"".[11]
In February 2014, during a drought that had hit California, Nunes rejected any link between the drought and global warming, saying ""Global warming is nonsense."" He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of Californias system of water irrigation and storage, and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon. There was plenty of water. This has nothing to do with drought.""[12][13]
In 2006, Nunes authored the ""American-Made Energy Freedom Act"". In July 2008, the Republican Conference introduced the American Energy Act, which included a key Nunes proposal from the American-Made Energy Freedom Act to establish a renewable energy trust fund from revenues generated by deep ocean and Arctic coastal plain exploration and invest the monies in alternative fuels and technology.[14]
On July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, ""A Roadmap for America's Energy Future"". It accelerates the exploration and production of fossil fuel; supports the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies; and expands the number of nuclear reactors from the current 104 to 300 over the next 30 years.[15] Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal wrote that ""It's a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it. It returns government to the role of energy facilitator, not energy boss. It costs nothing and contains no freebies. It instead offers a competitive twist to government support of renewable energy.""[16]
On January 27, 2010, Nunes became an original cosponsor of H.R. 4529, ""A Roadmap for America's Future"", sponsored by Paul Ryan.[17] H.R. 4529 proposes major reforms of the U.S. health care system, Social Security, the federal tax code, job training, and the budget process. The ""Roadmap"" claims to solve the problem of the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and provides for their long-term financial solvency. With respect to Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the plan would increase costs for States or those States would reduce enrollment; with respect to Medicare, the CBO has said the average senior would pay nearly twice what they currently contribute for the same coverage when the plan is fully implemented. On January 29, 2010, President Obama said that the ""Roadmap"" is a ""legitimate"" plan to solve the fiscal crisis facing the United States due to the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Medicaid.[18] Nunes was also a cosponsor of ""Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008"", an earlier version of H.R. 4529.
Also in 2009, Nunes coauthored the ""Patients' Choice Act"" with Paul Ryan (R-WI) in the House, and Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Richard Burr (R-NC) in the Senate. The Patient's Choice Act would establish a system of state health insurance exchanges and amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. The bill also proposes to adsorb Medicaid programs to the exchange system.[19] The Patients' Choice Act was incorporated into A Roadmap for America's Future.
On December 2, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 6484, the ""Public Employee Pension Transparency Act"".[20] Paul Ryan and Darrell Issa (R-CA) are cosponsors. H.R. 6484 enhances transparency for state and local pensions, and would establish a clear federal prohibition on any future public pension bailouts by the federal government.
California State Route 99 is a highway running north and south that breaks off from Interstate 5 at Wheeler Ridge in Kern County and continues through the Central Valley until it connects with I-5 again at Red Bluff in Tehama County. In 2005, Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional High Priority Corridor. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the Interstate Highway System. The bill became law as part of H.R. 3 in August 2005. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the ""San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act"", which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99.[21] H.R. 761 was cosponsored by Jeff Denham (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).[22]
The Hubbard Act of 2008, H.R.5825, was named in honor of the Hubbard brothers of California, Jared, Nathan, and Jason. Jared and Nathan lost their lives serving in Iraq. Jason Hubbard was discharged as a sole survivor, but denied separation benefits on leaving the Army. The Hubbard Act provides sole survivors a number of benefits already offered to other soldiers honorably discharged. Sole survivors also do not have to repay any portion of their enlistment bonus, are entitled to the educational benefits of the Montgomery GI Bill, and can receive separation pay and transitional healthcare coverage.
As chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nunes has oversight over 17 military and national intelligence programs, including the CIA and other clandestine activities. He has traveled extensively as a committee member. Unlike most congressional travel, in the highly secretive world of intelligence little is disclosed where Members of Congress travel unless reported by the House intelligence committee, foreign governments, or international media. Committee records indicate that Nunes has traveled to Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia during 20112012.[23] Foreign country news reports reveal that Nunes was in Kashmir in November 2011 with Mac Thornberry (R-TX) also a member of the House intelligence committee and vice-chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, as part of a larger trip to India. It was further reported (and photographed) that they met with Kashmir Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah.[24]
As co-chair of the Brazil and Mexico caucuses, Nunes was selected by Speaker John Boehner to be a member of a well-publicized congressional delegation that the Speaker led to Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in January 2012. Members of the delegation were Reps. Dave Camp (R-MI), Ways and Means Committee chairman; Doc Hastings (R-WA), Natural Resources Committee chairman; John Kline (R-MN), Education and the Workforce Committee chairman; Greg Walden (R-OR); and Dan Boren (D-OK). Boren was the sole Democrat on the trip.
As co-chair with Jared Polis (D-CO) of the U.S.-Mexico Friendship Caucus, Nunes along with members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference of the House of Representatives met with President Felipe Caldern of Mexico on April 24, 2012, in what is believed to be Caldern's final trip to Washington, D.C, as President of Mexico. Steny Hoyer, the Democratic Whip, also attended the meeting.[25]
Nunes has been characterized as confrontational and sharped-tongued by his opponents.[26] He has been an unrelenting critic of American liberals, particularly the environmental lobby. He wrote in his book that members of the environmental lobby were ""followers of neo-Marxist, socialist, Maoist or Communist ideals."" [27] During the debate over President Obama's health care bill in the House of Representatives, Nunes said of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ""For most of the 20th century people fled the ghost of communist dictators and now you are bringing the ghosts back into this chamber."" [28] He has also had a long-running dispute with another San Francisco Bay Area Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, over California water policy and other issues,[29] even running a series of advertisements against her in California.[30] This fueled media speculation, later denied, that Nunes would challenge her for the Senate.[31] He has said of Feinstein, ""She is either held hostage by extremists or she is an extremist."" [32]
Nunes has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy referring to it as a ""complete disaster"". He has also called Obama administration officials ""wimps' for being opposed to enhanced interrogation techniques but for using drones instead to deal with terrorists. ""People complain about harsh interrogation yet are okay with vaporizing people. In reality, they are kind of wimps, because they are not willing to do the hard stuff of capturing and interrogating people to get actionable information. The enemy knows that this administration won't interrogate them,"" Nunes told the American Thinker.[33]
Nunes' verbal jousting is not restricted to liberals in Congress or the Obama administration. During the October 2013 budget standoff, Nunes famously called certain members of his own Republican Conference who favored a government shutdown, ""Lemmings with suicide vests, it's kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings"" because of their tactics.[34] [35] [36]
In May 2014, Nunes came under fire when he made the charge that Congressman Justin Amash was ""al-Qaeda's best friend in Congress"" due to Amash's voting record on war, foreign policy, and civil liberties.[37]
On September 13, 2010, Nunes' book, Restoring the Republic: A Clear, Concise, and Colorful Blueprint for America's Future was published by WND Books, an imprint of WorldNetDaily.
Nunes is married to Elizabeth Nunes (ne Tamariz), with whom he has three daughters-- Evelyn, Julia, and Margaret[2]."

California State Assembly","Baptist - SBC","Kevin Owen McCarthy (born January 26, 1965) is the House Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Representative for California's 23rd District.
A Republican, he was formerly Chairman of the California Young Republicans and the Young Republican National Federation, McCarthy worked as district director for U.S. Representative Bill Thomas and in 2000 was elected to serve as a Trustee to the Kern Community College District. He then served in the California State Assembly from 2002 to 2006, including a spell from 2004 to 2006 as the Minority Leader. When Thomas retired from the House in 2006, McCarthy ran to succeed him and won the election. The 23rd district (numbered as the 22nd District from 2007 to 2013), is based in Bakersfield and includes large slices of Kern and Tulare counties.
In the House, McCarthy served as House Chief Deputy Republican Whip from 2009 to 2011 and as House Majority Whip from 2011 to August 2014, when he was elected House Majority Leader to replace the outgoing Eric Cantor, who had been defeated in the Republican primary for his seat.[1][2]


Born in Bakersfield, McCarthy is a fourth-generation resident of Kern County. He states that he is the first Republican in his immediate family.[3][4] His father was a fireman and his mother was a homemaker.[4] In one campaign ad, he claimed that, ""Jeremiah McCarthy's house still stands"". At the age of 19 he opened his first business, a deli, after winning five thousand dollars from a lottery ticket.[5] He subsequently sold the deli to attend California State University, Bakersfield.[6] He obtained a B.S. in marketing, in 1989 and an M.B.A., in 1994.[6]
In 1995, he was chairman of the California Young Republicans. From 1999 to 2001, he was chairman of the Young Republican National Federation.[4] From the late 1990s until 2000, he was the district director for U.S. Representative Bill Thomas, who, at the time, chaired the House Ways and Means Committee.[6] Kevin won his first election in 2000 as Trustee to the Kern Community College District.[6]
McCarthy was elected to the California State Assembly in 2002, becoming Republican floor leader in his freshman term in 2003.[6] He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2006.[7][6]
McCarthy entered the Republican primary for the 22ndthe real contest in this heavily Republican districtafter his former boss, Thomas, announced his retirement. He won the general election with 70.7% of the vote.[8][9]
He ran unopposed.[10]
He was virtually unopposed, winning 98.8% of the vote, with opposition coming only from a write-in candidate.[11]
He was a primary author H.R. 1581[12] Wilderness and Roadless Area Release Act of 2011. It released wilderness study areas and forest service road-less areas administered and managed by the Bureau of Land Management from federal protection.[12] It also attempted to undo the decades-old multiple use approach enshrined in the National Forest Management Act and Federal Land Policy and Management Act, where wilderness is balanced with other public uses. Over 4 million acres in California alone would have been stripped of wilderness protection.[citation needed] The bill was widely opposed by environmentalists, as well as outdoor recreation advocates and businesses, and ultimately died in committee.[13]
Redistricting before the 2012 election resulted in McCarthy's district being renumbered as the 23rd District. It became somewhat more compact, losing its share of the Central Coast while picking up a large chunk of Tulare County. However, the district was as heavily Republican as its predecessor, and McCarthy easily won a fourth term, taking 73.2% of the vote vs. 26.8% for independent (No Party Preference, or NPP) opponent Terry Phillips.[14]
McCarthy won re-election to a fifth term in 2014.
As a freshman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican Steering Committee. In 2008, Republican leader John Boehner appointed him chairman of the Republican Platform Committee during the committee's meetings in Minneapolis in August 2008, which produced the Republican Party Platform for 2008. He was also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program.[15]
After the 2008 elections, he was chosen as chief deputy minority whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in the House Republican caucus. His predecessor, Eric Cantor, was named minority whip. On November 17, 2010, he was selected by the House Republican caucus to be the House majority whip in the 112th Congress. In this post, he was the third-ranking House Republican, behind Speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor.
Cantor lost the June 2014 primary for his seat in Congress, and announced he would step down from House leadership at the end of July. McCarthy sought to succeed Cantor, and after some speculation that Representatives Pete Sessions and Jeb Hensarling would challenge him, both dropped out leaving a clear path for McCarthy to become House majority leader.[16] On June 13 conservative Representative Raul Labrador announced he also was seeking the leadership position.[17] On June 19 the Republican caucus elected McCarthy majority leader.[18][19]
According to the University of Minnesotas Humphrey School of Public Affairs, McCarthy is the least-tenured Majority Leader in the history of the House of Representatives. When he assumes the Majority Leader position in July 2014, he will have served for only seven years, six months and 29 days, the least experience of any floor leader in the House's history by more than a year.[20]
McCarthy kept four of his predecessor's staff members on his staff when he took over as majority leader, including deputy chief of staff Neil Bradley, who now has served in that role for three majority leaders.[21]
In 2010 McCarthy signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[22]
McCarthy does not support renewing the charter of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., as he expects the private sector to take over the role.[23]
McCarthy and his wife Judy have two children. They are lifelong residents of Bakersfield.[6]
In 2000, he was elected as a trustee on the Kern Community College District board.[6] He has also been on the board of directors for Community Action Partnership of Kern.[24]"

University of California, Santa Barbara","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Capps","Lois Capps","Democratic","Nurse, Teacher","Lutheran - ELCA","Lois Capps (born January 10, 1938) is the U.S. Representative for California's 24th congressional district, serving in Congress since 1998. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 22nd District from 1998 to 2003 and the 23rd from 2003 to 2013, includes all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and a portion of Ventura County.
Capps serves on the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where she is a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Health. She is a member of the New Democrat Coalition.


Born Lois Ragnhild Grimsrud in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, the daughter of Solveig Magdalene (ne Gullixson) and Rev. Jurgen Milton Grimsrud, her father was a Lutheran minister. Both of her parent's families came from Norway.[1] She has lived in Santa Barbara since 1964. She was educated at Pacific Lutheran University with a bachelor's degree in nursing. She earned a master's degree in religion at Yale University and a master's degree in education at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
In 1960, while at Yale, she married Walter Capps, a divinity student at Yale who later became a prominent religious studies professor at UCSB; they eventually had three children. Walter died in 1997 and their eldest daughter Lisa died in 2000. Lois Capps worked for 20 years as a nurse and health advocate for the Santa Barbara public schools and also taught early childhood education part-time at Santa Barbara City College.
Walter Capps was elected to Congress in 1996 in a rematch of his 1994 race against Republican Andrea Seastrand. However, he died of a heart attack on October 28, 1997, only nine months into his term. His widow won the then-22nd District seat by defeating Republican Tom Bordonaro in a special election on March 10, 1998. She was sworn into the 105th Congress on March 17. Lois Capps successfully defended her seat against Bordonaro in a general election later that year, and commenced her first full term in office. Capps is one of two sitting representatives to be elected to their seats following the deaths of their husbands, along with Doris Matsui (D-CA).
In 2000, Capps retained the 22nd district seat, defeating Republican Mike Stoker with 53% of the vote. She was the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term in over 50 years (the district, known as the 11th from its formation in 1943 until 1953, the 13th from 1953 to 1975 and the 19th from 1975 to 1993, had been held by Republicans from 1947 until Walter Capps was sworn in 1997).
Capps' district was renumbered as the 23rd after the 2000 census and made somewhat safer, and she was reelected without serious opposition in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. Her district was renumbered as the 24th District after the 2010 census.[2] David Wasserman, House editor of The Cook Political Report, predicted that this would be a more difficult race, and local Republicans confirmed that Capps was one of their top targets in California.[3] The reconfigured district still includes Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, but was redrawn to include new inland areas as well.[4] Capps eventually beat her opponent, Abel Maldonado, with 54.8% of the vote.[5]
In 2014, Capps ran against Republican Chris Mitchum, an actor, screenwriter, and businessman. Mitchum is the son of legendary film star Robert Mitchum. This was Mitchum's second consecutive try for the 24th district, having previously lost the 2012 primary to Abel Maldonado.[6] In the closest race of her entire congressional career, Capps ultimately won with only a 3.8% margin over Mitchum.[7]
Capps has been described as a ""solid liberal"". In The Washingtonian magazine's 2006 ""Best and Worst of Congress"" poll of congressional staffers, Capps was named the nicest member of Congress.[8]
In 2011, Capps voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[9]
Capps supported the Obama administration's economic stimulus and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[10] She was strongly critical of the StupakPitts Amendment to the latter, which placed limits on taxpayer-funding of abortions (except in the cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life). Capps had earlier sponsored the Capps Amendment, which was defeated and replaced by the Stupak Amendment. Capps introduced the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013 which would, if enacted, authorize the NIH to support, fund, and coordinate data from research on rare pediatric diseases.
In 2012, she was the only member of the House to vote ""no"" on Resolution 556 to condemn the government of Iran for its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani of the charge of apostasy. The resolution passed 417-1 with 15 non-votes.[11] Her spokeswoman later said that Capps strongly supported the resolution, but cast the no vote by mistake.[12]
Capps has a major interest in environmental policy. In 2004, the House passed her piece of legislation to prohibit ""comprehensive inventory of oil and gas resources beneath the outer continental shelf."" She was also a vocal opponent of drilling for oil in the Los Padres National Forest and offshore drilling off the coast of California.[8]"

Brownley is ran for re-election in 2014, facing Republican Jeff Gorell in the general election.[18] Brownley is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline Program, which is designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents. After Republican candidates garnered over 50% of the vote in the June 2014 blanket primary, the Cook Political Report changed the rating of the race from ""Leans Democratic"" to ""Toss-up.""[19][20] The election did become a close race, making for closer scrutiny of the results. Initial results show Brownley winning 51% to 49%, with about 4,000 votes separating the candidates.[21]

She is a member of the Democratic Party.
Chu was previously Chair of the California Board of Equalization, representing the 4th District.[3] She had also served on the Garvey Unified School District Board of Education, the Monterey Park City Council (with five terms as mayor) and the California State Assembly.
Chu ran in the 32nd congressional district special election for the seat that was vacated by Hilda Solis after she was confirmed as Barack Obama's U.S. Secretary of Labor in 2009.[4] She defeated Republican candidate Betty Tom Chu and Libertarian candidate Christopher Agrella in a runoff election on July 14, 2009.[5] She is the first Chinese American woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress.[6] Chu was redistricted to the 27th District in 2012, but was still re-elected to a third term, defeating Republican challenger Jack Orswell.


Judy Chu is the second of four children of Judson and May Chu, who were married in 1948 in their ancestral home of Xinhui, Jiangmen, Guangdong. After getting married, they moved to Los Angeles, near 62nd Street and Normandie Avenue, where Chu was born and grew up until her early teen years, when the family moved to the Bay Area.[7][8]
Chu graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles. She then earned a Ph.D. in psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology.
She taught as a psychology professor at the Los Angeles Community College District for 20 years, including 13 years at East Los Angeles College.[3][9]
Chu's first elected position was Board Member for the Garvey School District in Rosemead, California in 1985. In 1988 she was elected to the city council of Monterey Park, where she served as mayor for three terms.[3][9] She ran for the California State Assembly in 1994, but lost the Democrat primary to Diane Martinez; in 1998, she lost the primary to Gloria Romero.
Chu was elected to the State Assembly in a May 15, 2001, special election after Romero was elected to the State Senate. She was elected to a full term in 2002 and was reelected in 2004. The district includes Alhambra, El Monte, Duarte, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, San Marino and South El Monte, within Los Angeles County.[10]
Barred by term limits from running for a third full term in 2006, Chu was elected to the State Board of Equalization from the 4th District, representing most of Los Angeles County.
Chu decided to run for the 2009 special election for the California's 32nd congressional district after U.S. Congresswoman Hilda Solis was appointed to become President Barack Obama's U.S. Secretary of Labor. Chu led the field in the May 19 special election. However, due to the crowded nature of the primary (eight Democrats and four Republicans filed) she only got 32% of the vote, well short of the 50% vote needed to win outright.[11] In the run-off election, she defeated Republican Betty Chu (her cousin-in-law and a then-Monterey Park City Councilwoman) 62%33%.[5][12]
She had been heavily favored due to the district's heavy Democrat tilt and with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+15, it is one of the safest Democratic districts in the nation. She won re-election to her first full term with 71% of the vote.[13]
In August 2011, she decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 27th congressional district.[14] The district has the second highest percentage of Asian Americans in the state with 37%, behind the newly redrawn 17th CD which is 50% Asian.[15] Registered Democrats make up 42% of the district. Obama won the district with 63% in the 2008 presidential. Jerry Brown won with 55% in the 2010 gubernatorial election.[16][17] Representative Chu won re-election by defeating Republican Jack Orswell 64% to 36%.[18]
Chu was sworn into office on July 16, 2009.
Chu cosponsored the Global Sexual and Reproductive Health Act of 2010 which authorizes the President of the United States to support measures providing abortions and other reproduction assistance to women in developing countries. In 2010, Chu voting against measures proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives to strip government funding to Planned Parenthood, and opposed restricting federal funding of abortions.[19][20] Chu has received ratings of 100 from all Pro-Choice affiliates including Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has also received ratings of 100 from the NARAL pro-choice California in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 [21] while receiving very low ratings given by Pro-Life organizations in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21]
In 2009, Chu voted to increase the debt ceiling to $12.394 trillion. In 2010, Chu voted to increase the debt ceiling to $14.294 trillion. In January 2011, she voted against a bill to reduce spending on non-security items to fiscal year 2008 levels. In 2011, Chu voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011, which incrementally raised the debt ceiling.[22]
Chu opposed the ""See Something, Say Something Act of 2011,"" which provides ""immunity for reports of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior and response."" She said, ""if a person contacts law enforcement about something based solely on someone's race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, they would not receive immunity from civil lawsuits.""[23][24]
On July 24, 2013, the United States House of Representatives voted on Amendment 100 to the H.R. 2397 Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014 which if passed would have ended the authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act.[25] Chu voted ""Aye"" to pass amendment 100 and end the blanket collection authority; however, the amendment did not pass with the ""Noes"" blocking the amendment 217-205.[26]
In 2011, Rep. Chu became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[27]
On June 18, 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution, introduced by Congresswoman Chu, that formally expresses the regret of the House of Representatives for the Chinese Exclusion Act, which imposed almost total restrictions on Chinese immigration and naturalization and denied Chinese-Americans basic freedoms because of their ethnicity. This was only the fourth time that the U.S. Congress issued an apology to a group of people.[28]
On December 11, 2014, Rep. Chu was formally reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee for interfering with their investigation of her office.[29][30]
[21]
Chu married Mike Eng in 1978. (Eng took Chu's seat on the Monterey Park City Council in 2001, when Chu left the council after getting elected to the Assembly, and in 2006 he took Chu's seat on the Assembly, when Chu left the Assembly.)
Chu's nephew, Lance Corporal Harry Lew, a US Marine, committed suicide while serving in Afghanistan on April 3, 2011, allegedly as a result of hazing from fellow Marines after Lew repeatedly fell asleep during his watch. Chu described her nephew as a patriotic American and said that those responsible must be brought to justice.[31]"

Harvard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff","Adam Schiff","Democratic","California State Senate, Assistant Prosecutor for the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California","Jewish","Adam Bennett Schiff (born June 22, 1960) is the U.S. Representative for California's 28th congressional district. He has served in Congress since 2001. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Schiff represented the 27th and 29th Districts between 2003 and 2013, which included the areas of Alhambra, Altadena, San Gabriel, Burbank, Glendale, South Pasadena, Temple City, Monterey Park, and Pasadena. In 2010, his district was re-districted to include new areas including Hollywood, Echo Park, Hollywood Hills, La Canada-Flintridge, La Crescenta Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Sunland-Tujunga, and West Hollywood, in addition to areas he represented before like Burbank, Glendale, and the western part of Pasadena.
Schiff has become an influential voice for his party in the House of Representatives on foreign policy and national security issues.[1] He serves as Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is currently on leave from the House Appropriations Committee which he joined in 2007. He previously served on the United States House Foreign Affairs Committee, and serves on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.


He was born in Framingham, Massachusetts to a traditional Jewish family, and moved to Oakland during high school.[2] He received a political science degree from Stanford University and a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.
After receiving his degree from Harvard, Schiff was a lawyer, working as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles branch of the U.S. Attorney's Office. During his time as an assistant U.S. Attorney, he gained attention by prosecuting a case against Richard Miller, a former FBI agent convicted of ""passing secret documents to the Soviet Union in exchange for a promised $65,000 in gold and cash."".[3] The first time Miller was tried, it resulted in a hung jury; the second time, it resulted in a conviction overturned on appeal,[4] and the third time he was convicted.
Schiff was elected to the State Senate after two unsuccessful attempts in 1996.[5] He was a member of the California State Senate, serving as the chair of that body's judiciary committee during his one term.
During his tenure in the California Senate, Schiff authored Senate Bill 1847, Chapter 1021. Signed into law in 1998, this created the Pasadena Blue Line Authority, which continued work on the stalled then-Blue Line light rail extension to Pasadena, which would later be named the Gold Line instead.
Schiff is currently serving his seventh term in Congress.
Schiff has been a leading voice in Armenian-American issues; he claims to have over 70,000 Armenian-Americans in his district.[6][7] He has strongly pushed for signing of the US House Resolution 106 recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On October 11, 2007, the resolution sponsored by Schiff was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.[8] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.-Turkey relations.[9] The resolution was again approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4, 2010 by a 23-22 margin.[10] He continues to reintroduce the resolution each subsequent Congress.
After the Supreme Court strike down campaign finance reform legislation in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission cases, Schiff introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn both decisions, H.J.Res 31, drafted by Harvard Law School Constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe.[11] The Amendment would make it clear that the Constitution does not restrict Congress from limiting campaign contributions and independent expenditures and would allow  but not require  states to enact their own public financing laws.[12] Schiff has also stated that after his first race in 2000, which was the most expensive House race ever at the time, the first bill he co-sponsored was the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.[13]
Beginning with Rep. Howard Berman before he was defeated for reelection, Schiff has worked on reducing unwanted helicopter noise across Los Angeles County by proposing legislation to force the FAA to study and regulate helicopter noise in Los Angeles, the Helicopter Noise Relief Act.[14] After reintroducing his legislation, Schiff has worked with Senator Dianne Feinstein to push the FAA to act, and together they attached a provision in the 2014 omnibus appropriations package directing the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and FAA to address helicopter noise in Los Angeles County skies.[15] The FAA has announced that they will create a county-wide helicopter noise public complaint system, the first step towards regulation.[16]
Schiff has been a prominent supporter of surveillance reforms, especially in the wake of the leaks of classified intelligence by Edward Snowden.[17] In 2007, in response to disclosure of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, Schiff and Rep. Jeff Flake offered a successful amendment in the House of Representatives to clarify that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive means for collecting foreign intelligence information within the United States.[18] Schiff has been a critic of the bulk collection of telephone metadata by the National Security Agency. In January 2014, Schiff introduced the Telephone Metatdata Reform Act,[19] which would prohibit the bulk collection of domestic phone records. Schiff has also introduced several bills aimed at reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, including a bill to require outside counsel to be appointed to argue for privacy and civil liberties protections in certain cases before the Court.[20]
Schiff was appointed to the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2014 by Nancy Pelosi to serve as one of the five Democrats on the Committee.[21] Schiff had participated in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation into the attacks on the Benghazi diplomatic compound, which found that the initial talking points provided by the intelligence community were flawed but without an intention to deceive and that diplomatic facilities across the world lacked adequate security.[22] The reports findings were unanimous and bipartisan. Before he was appointed as a Member of the Benghazi Select Committee, Schiff called the establishment of a select committee to investigate the 2012 attack a ""colossal waste of time,"" and said Democratic leaders should not appoint any members, stating: ""I think it's just a tremendous red herring and a waste of taxpayer resources.""[23] Despite those reservations, he still accepted an appointment to the Committee because if he felt he ""could add value, [he] would serve.""[24]
Schiff formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press in 2006[25] aimed at advancing press freedom around the world. The Caucus proposed the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act and it was originally introduced to Congress by Schiff and Rep. Mike Pence (R., Ind.) and by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) on October 1, 2009 in response to the murder of Daniel Pearl by terrorists in Pakistan.[26][27] The legislation requires the United States Department of State to expand its scrutiny of news media intimidation and freedom of the press restrictions during its annual report on human rights in each country.[28] After its introduction, the act passed through the House of Representatives with a vote of 403 to 12 and passed unanimously in the Senate; however, a provision requiring the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Department of States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in consultation with the Undersecretary for Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy, to establish a grant program aiming to promote freedom of the press worldwide.[27] On May 17, 2010 President Barack Obama, accompanied by the Pearl family, signed into law the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act.[29]
After the President's speech at the National Defense University examining the U.S. war powers during the War on Terror, Schiff introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, the legislation passed in the days after the September 11 attacks to combat Al Qaeda, because he felt that ""the current AUMF is outdated and straining at the edges to justify the use of force outside the war theater.""[30] The bill, introduced with Rep. Tom Rooney (R-FL), was intended to sunset, or repeal, concurrent with the last U.S. troops leaving Afghanistan on December 31, 2014.[31] While the bill has not come up for a vote, Schiff has used the appropriations and authorization process for defense programs to force a vote on the legislation, first in 2013 which failed 185-236,[32] and second in 2014 more narrowly 191-231.[33] The 2001 war authorization has been used as justification in the U.S. war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, something Schiff has found uncomfortable, stating that ""if Congress just sits on its hands, it will rue the day that it did because it will set a precedent.""[34] Schiff introduced his own legislation authorizing war against ISIS, including sunsetting the 2001 authorization and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Iraq Resolution), a limit against ground troops used in Syria and Iraq, and a strict 18 month time limit.[35] In addition to his legislation, Schiff has been a forceful proponent of debating and voting on a new war authorization against ISIS.[36]
Schiff was elected in 2000, defeating Republican incumbent Jim Rogan. The district had once been a Republican stronghold, but had been trending Democratic since the early 1990s. In what was the most expensive House race ever at the time[37] (several elections in 2006[38] and 2008[39] later eclipsed it), Schiff unseated Rogan, taking 53 percent of the vote to Rogan's 44 percent. He became only the second Democrat to represent this district since its creation in 1913 (it was the 9th District from 1913 to 1933, the 11th District from 193343, the 20th District from 1943 to 1975, the 22nd District from 1975 to 1993, and the 27th District from 1993 to 2003).
In 2010, Schiff defeated Tea Party backed Republican John Colbert for a 6th term.[40] In 2012, Schiff defeated Republican Phil Jennerjahn.[41] In 2014, Schiff defeated independent candidate Steve Stokes. [42]
Schiff has settled in Burbank, California with his wife Eve Marion (ne Sanderson)[43] and two children, Alexa and Elijah.[44]
Schiff has participated in multiple endurance challenges including triathlons and marathons. Schiff was the only Congressman to participate in the inaugural Washington, D.C. triathlon in 2010,[45] and has since participated in other races in Philadelphia, New York City and Malibu.[46] In 2014, Schiff became the first Member of Congress to participate in the AIDS/LifeCycle, a seven day charity bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles to raise awareness and funding to fight HIV and AIDS.[47] The tour includes up to 2,500 bicyclists and more than 500 support crew participants who cycle or crew to raise funds for HIV/AIDS services & raise awareness of HIV/AIDS."

She is a member of the Democratic Party. She previously served in the California State Assembly and the Norwalk City Council.
Napolitano previously represented the 34th district from 1999 to 2003, and the 38th district from 2003 to 2013. Due to redistricting, Napolitano ran for, and won re-election in the 2012 United States elections in California's 32nd congressional district against Republican candidate David Miller. In the 2014 midterm elections, Napolitano was reelected, defeating Republican challenger Arturo Alas.


Napolitano was born and raised in Brownsville, Texas. After high school, she married and moved with her husband to California where they raised five children.
Napolitano began her political career as a member of the Norwalk City Council, winning her first election in 1986 by a mere 28 votes. Four years later she won re-election by the highest margin of votes recorded in city history. In 1989, Napolitano was elevated by her council colleagues to serve as Mayor. During her council tenure, she focused much of her attention on providing access to constituents and on redevelopment and transportation issues to address the city's need for jobs and a more diversified economic base.
Napolitano made her way up through the ranks of Ford Motor Company for 21 years. Following her retirement in 1992, she was elected to the California Assembly, and became a leader on international trade, environmental protection, transportation and immigration. In 1996 she requested and received the creation of the first new California State Assembly Standing Committee in nine years, the Committee on International Trade, which she chaired until being termed out in 1998. In her six years in the Assembly, she also served as chair of the Women's Caucus and vice-chair of the Latino caucus.
Napolitano has been a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources since the 106th Congress and was selected the Chair of the Water and Power Subcommittee for the 110th Congress. She has promoted conservation, water recycling, desalination, and sound groundwater management and storage to address Southern California's need for adequate water quality and supply.

She is also a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.
At the start of the 110th Congress, Napolitano became the most senior new member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with jurisdiction over America's surface transportation, freight and passenger rail, the inland waterway system, international maritime commerce, the Economic Development Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' support of the nation's water resources, and the federal clean water program. Napolitano's experience includes 6 years on the California State Assembly Transportation Committee, and current work on rail safety and congestion relief in the San Gabriel Valley.
Statistics showing one in three Latina adolescents contemplated suicide prompted Napolitano to spearhead a school-based Latina adolescent mental health program in three local middle schools and one high school. She co-chairs the Congressional Mental Health Caucus with Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA). The bipartisan caucus included more than 70 members during the 108th Congress and over 90 members during the 109th Congress. As co-chair, Napolitano has hosted congressional briefings on children and on veteran's mental health needs, working on proposals to improve VA mental health services. A key priority is legislation to provide mental health parity in health insurance.
During the 109th Congress, Napolitano served as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which continues to address national education, immigration, health, and civil rights issues, and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community.
She claims responsibility for a $2.8 million Labor Department grant for precision and computer numeric control (CNC) machinists, $4 million to spur reuse and redevelopment of the Northrop Grumman B-2 facility in Pico Rivera, $1 million for upgrades to Cal Poly Pomona's Aerospace Engineering Laboratory Facilities, and $1 million for Central Atmospheric Monitoring Systems in Navy Submarines. These programs support research and development, helping expand the reach of local academic institutions and enhancing the local economy.
Napolitano is also concerned with suicide prevention among Latina adolescents noting that nearly one-out-of-three has seriously contemplated suicide, the highest rate for any ethnic or racial group in the country. In 2001, she claimed responsibility for getting funds included in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill for a pilot project supporting school-based, mental health services in her district. To date, $1.6 million has been secured for this program now operating in 4 local schools.
In 2011, Napolitano voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[1]
Napolitano established a district Health Task Force composed of health providers, educators and experts throughout the local area. The Task Force helps keep the Congresswoman apprised of key health issues facing her constituents and works with the Congresswoman to devise programs and projects to improve health care and health outcomes for the local area. The Congresswoman also works with the Health Task Force to pursue funding options through California's Proposition 63 Mental Health Services Expansion and for additional training of nursing professionals at both the entry level (CNAs and LVNs) and RNs with advanced degrees.
The Congresswoman has initiated a Manufacturing Task Force in her district, composed of various small and mid-sized companies. The task force meets as needed to examine key issues and work on strategies that will foster more manufacturing jobs and create a positive climate for manufacturing retention and growth.
Napolitano hosts various events throughout the year, informing residents of her District on the impact of federal legislation and policy, and honoring local constituents for their outstanding achievements. Prominent among these events are the annual Congressional Art Competition and Women of the Year recognition ceremonies.
A 2009 story first reported by Bloomberg News[2] and further detailed by the Los Angeles Times[3] questioned the personal loan interest rate that the Federal Election Commission had authorized her to use during her initial 1998 run for Congress. Both Bloomberg and the Times noted that the FEC had accepted the argument that the eighteen percent rate was equivalent to the early withdrawal penalty that Napolitano was subject to by withdrawing $150,000 from her employee retirement fund and then loaning those funds to her campaign. Both sources also reported the rate dropping to ten percent in 2006, and cited FEC filings as of December 31, 2009 indicating that $221,780 in interest had been paid. The Hill, a Washington DC based newspaper, reported that Federal Election Commission filings[4] for the campaign reporting period ending September 30, 2010 had indicated that the debt had been completed retired.[5] The story was again referenced by CBS News in a 60 Minutes episode in October 2013. This was the first such time that the Congresswoman responded firsthand, where she countered the media's implication that she had personally benefited from the loan, stating It isnt like Ive really profited. I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.
In January 2011, CNN State of the Union featured Napolitano[6] as part of a bipartisan panel alongside Republican Tim Murphy to discuss adolescent mental illness in the wake of the January 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona that resulted in the deaths of six and wounding of nineteen, including Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Asked why there wasn't more coverage of the mental health issues outside of this and other gun violence tragedies, Napolitano Napolitano told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. ""Unfortunately it does not hit the radar scope in Washington or almost in any state house ... It's always something you don't talk about, you don't discuss because of the stigma, and I think we need to address that heavily.""
In February, 2011, MSNBC's NewsNation interviewed Napolitano alongside LA Lakers basketball player Ron Artest to discuss her introduction of HR 751, the Mental Health in Schools Act.[7] When asked why she was focusing her attention on mental health issues, she explained her experience with a successful local pilot initiative partnering with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), however noted that securing funding was challenging despite recent violent school tragedies, saying ""Children don't vote - and to me that's a crime because our children need help and we need to provide it for them.""
Napolitano is married to Frank Napolitano, retired restaurateur and community activist. They have five grown children, fourteen grandchildren, and one great grandson. She is not related to former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano."

Some of his legislative actions as a state senator include the following:
Senator Lieu authored a bill (SB-1172: Sexual orientation change efforts) in 2012 that bans the provision of sexual orientation change therapy (including conversion therapy) to minors. This bill passed both the State Assembly and Senate with substantial support, and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2012.[24] This made California the first U.S. state to have such a ban. Proponents of the ban cited sources including several reports of the American Psychological Association that found that conversion therapy presented a serious health risk ""including confusion, depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, shame, social withdrawal, suicidality, substance abuse, stress, disappointment, self-blame, decreased self-esteem and authenticity to others, increased self-hatred, hostility and blame toward parents, feelings of anger and betrayal, loss of friends and potential romantic partners, problems in sexual and emotional intimacy, sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual behaviors, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to self, a loss of faith, and a sense of having wasted time and resources."" [25]
Lieu and his wife Betty (a former California Deputy Attorney General) reside in Torrance with their two sons, Brennan and Austin.[26] In April 2013, Lieu and his family were the victims of swatting, where someone tricks EMS (911 services) to come to your house when there is no emergency. He believed this to be retaliation for his work on legislation to increase penalties for swatting.[27]"

He is a member of the United States House of Representatives and a member of the Democratic Party.[3] In what was considered a major upset,[4] Ruiz defeated redistricted, incumbent Republican representative Mary Bono Mack in the November 2012 general election in California's 36th congressional district. Ruiz was reelected to Congress in the 2014 elections, after what was considered one of the most competitive congressional races in the country.[5]


Ruiz was born on August 25, 1972[6] in Zacatecas, Mexico[7] and raised in Coachella, California.[8] His parents were farmworkers.[9] He graduated from Coachella Valley High School at age 17, and went to UCLA in 1990, graduating magna cum laude before attending Harvard Medical School.[8] He was the first Hispanic to receive three graduate degrees from Harvard University: an M.D. from the Harvard Medical School; an M.P.P. from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government; and an M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health.[8]
In 1997, while attending Harvard as a medical student, Ruiz participated in an annual Thanksgiving protest in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Ruiz was one of 25 people arrested at the event. The charges were later dropped as part of a deal that also dismissed claims of police brutality.[10]
Two years later, in 1999, Ruiz took part in another Thanksgiving protest at which he read a letter of support for Leonard Peltier, who was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first degree murder in the shooting of two Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents during a 1975 conflict on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. During the 2012 congressional campaign, the incident was used as an attack by his opponent, Mary Bono Mack. In response, Ruiz's campaign stated that he had not supported Peltier.[10][11]
After graduating from Harvard University, Ruiz spent time working abroad in Mexico, El Salvador, and Serbia, before taking a job as an emergency physician at the Eisenhower Medical Center, a nonprofit hospital in the Coachella Valley. He founded the Coachella Valley Healthcare Initiative in 2010. In 2011, he became senior associate dean at the School of Medicine at University of California, Riverside.[8][12]
In 2012, he received a Commander's Award for Public Service from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division for his humanitarian efforts for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[8] Ruiz's background as a physician has gained him attention for several incidents in which he has provided medical aid to fellow airline passengers, including conservative columnist Lisa De Pasquale.[13]
Ruiz ran for the United States House of Representatives in 2012 as a first-time candidate in California's 36th congressional district. The district had previously been the 45th, represented by 15-year incumbent Mary Bono Mack. While Ruiz was initially regarded as a long shot to win,[14] he gained traction in the polls in the months before the November election.[citation needed] He was endorsed by Bill Clinton in October 2012.[14] He was elected with 52.9% of the vote, to Bono Mack's 47.1%.[15] Upon taking office in January 2013, Ruiz became the first Democrat to represent the Coachella Valley since John V. Tunney was elected, in 1971.[16][bettersourceneeded]
Ruiz ran for re-election in 2014. He competed in the blanket primary on June 3, 2014, finishing first with 50.3% of the vote.[17][18] Ruiz then faced Republican nominee and state assemblyman Brian Nestande in the general election, which took place November 4, 2014.[19] Despite being considered one of the most vulnerable incumbent members of the House of Representatives, Ruiz was re-elected with 54.2% of the vote, to Nestande's 45.8%.
In April 2013, Ruiz introduced his first bill, the SelectUSA Authorization Act of 2013. The bill would incentivize international corporations to invest in creating manufacturing jobs in the United States rather than overseas.[20] The bill has not been voted on by the House.[21]
In April 2013, Ruiz voted for CISPA, which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies.[22]
In May 2013, Ruiz voted against repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[23][24] During his 2012 campaign for Congress, Ruiz stated his support for the Affordable Care Act. As full implementation of the law began in late 2013, its popularity with the public plummeted as many Americans had their policies canceled due to lacking coverage requirements mandated by the law,[25] and the federal health care online exchange had many technical problems that delayed the ability to sign up to new plans.[26]
Ruiz voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions that take place 20 or more weeks after fertilization.[27]
In August 2014, a family emergency prevented Ruiz from casting votes on two immigration bills.[28]
Ruiz married Monica Rivers in 2014.[1]"

This bill is a response to the suicide of Megan Meier, a 13 year old girl whose 2006 suicide was attributed to cyber-bullying through the social networking website MySpace. The bill has drawn criticism from members of the on-line community, legal scholars, and others who have contended that the bill would infringe the constitutional right of freedom of speech.[5][6]
After the Arizona State Legislature passed State Senate Bill 1070 and after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed it into law, Linda Sanchez generated controversy[7] when she claimed that the law, and similar laws throughout the United States, were the product of white supremacists: ""There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics.""[8] Rep. Gary Miller called Sanchez's comments ""an outrageous accusation.""[9] Her comments were also condemned by Steve Poizner.[7]
Snchez is married to Jim Sullivan, whom she married on April 13, 2009, in the district office of Congressman John B. Larson, who introduced the two about two years prior to the wedding.[10] The marriage is the second for Sanchez, and Sullivan has three children from a previous marriage.[11] On May 13, 2009, she became the 8th woman to have given birth while serving in Congress when she gave birth to her first son, Joaquin Snchez Sullivan.[12]
Snchez's father, Ignacio, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, which Snchez has cited as a motivation for finding a cure for the disease.[13]
She is the younger sister of 46th District Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, who is nine years her senior, making them the first and to date only sister pair to serve in Congress. Linda Snchez is considered somewhat more liberal than her older sister. While Loretta began her political career as a moderate Republican before becoming a Democrat, Linda has always been a Democrat. Also, while Loretta is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition, Linda is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Stephen Colbert interviewed Snchez for his 434-part series ""Better Know A District"" on The Colbert Report. The segment was aired on Comedy Central on March 9, 2006.
Snchez delivered the Spanish version of the Democratic Radio Address on May 6, 2006.[14]
In September 2006 Linda Sanchez won the contest ""Funniest Celebrity in Washington"" during a charity fundraiser.[15]
In 2008 sister congresswomen Loretta Sanchez and Linda Sanchez published the joint memoir Dream in Color: How the Sanchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress.[16] Publishers Weekly reviewed the book and wrote: ""Linda and Loretta Sanchez present their compelling storynoteworthy not only for their history-making achievements (including first sisters or women of any relation to serve together in Congress, first woman and person of color to represent a district in Orange County, first Latina on the House Judiciary Committee and first Head Start child to be elected to Congress) but also for its American Dream aspecttheir parents immigrated from Mexico and despite lacking a formal education managed to send their seven children to college. Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoirperhaps because these two women are not typical politicians.""[17]
Project Vote Smart, using public statements, voting record, and evaluations from special interest groups,[18] was able to infer the major issues Snchez would or not agree upon. Though not officially admitted by Sanchez, it is concluded that Snchez:
According to careful research done by Project Vote Smart, they were able to determine that Linda Snchez was pro-choice in the issue of abortion.[20]
On October 4, 2011, Linda Snchez made a statement on the LGBT History Month, saying: ""We must continue to strive to end discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation and fight so that all Americans have the right to marry and start families with those they love. I remain committed to supporting marriage equality, investments in HIV/AIDS care, treatment and research, and campaigns that take action against bullying in schools.""[24]
On a letter written on February 9, 2010 to President Barack Obama, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Charles Schumer, Snchez explained how ""Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But, same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as ""families"" under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right."" and how ""This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families.""[25]"

Royce was criticized for attending a rally in his home county, in which members of anti-Muslim groups chanted at Muslim-American families attending Islamic charity event that they should ""go home."" Royce replied that the anti-Muslim chants were done by a splinter group, not the main group of protesters, and he disavowed the chants, saying ""those remarks and conduct were disrespectful and offensive"".[20][21]
As a state senator[22] and US representative,[23] Royce sponsored bills and ballot initiatives on stalking and victims' rights.[24][25][26]
In foreign policy, Royce's voting record has earned the most pro-military possible rating from SANE.[11] In 2002, he voted in favor of authorizing President George W. Bush to use force in Iraq.[27] In 2003, he voted yes on an emergency appropriation of $78 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.[11] In every year from 2003 to 2006, he has voted in favor of the annual supplemental spending bill to continue funding for the Iraq war.[27][28] In 2005, he voted against Amendment 214 to HR 1815, which called on Bush to develop a plan for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq; in favor of Amendment 488 to HR 2601 to keep troops in Iraq; and in favor of HR 612 opposing a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq.[29] In 2006, he voted for HR 861, a resolution labeling the war in Iraq as part of a global war against terrorism.[27] Royce had a mixed voting record on the 2011 US involvement in Libya.[30]

A member of the Democratic Party, Takano has served on the Riverside Community College Board of Trustees since 1990. Upon taking office, Takano became the first openly gay person of color in Congress.


Takano was born in Riverside, California.[2] His family was relocated and interned from California to a ""War Relocation Camp"" during World WarII.[3] He is Sansei, that is, the grandson of people born in Japan who immigrated to the United States.[4] He attended La Sierra High School of the Alvord Unified School District, where he graduated as class valedictorian.[5] He graduated from Harvard University in 1983.[6]
He taught British literature in public schools for 23 years.[3] He was a member of the Republican Party through college, when he became a member of the Democratic Party.[6] In 1990 he was elected to the Riverside Community College Board of Trustees and has served on that body since then. While on the board, he shepherded a measure that provided Riverside Community College employees with domestic partner benefits.[3]
Takano ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives during the 1992 elections in the California's 43rd congressional district. He won a seven-candidate Democratic primary with 29% of the vote.[3][7] During the campaign, Republican State Assemblyman Ray Haynes outed Takano, calling him a ""homosexual liberal"".[8] Republican Ken Calvert defeated Takano by 519 votes, 47%-46%.[9][10]
In 1994, Takano defeated Raven Lopez Workman in the Democratic primary, 70%-30%.[11] In the general election, Calvert defeated Takano 55%-38%.[12][13]
In July 2011, Takano announced he would run for the U.S. House in the newly redrawn California 41st congressional district, established in the redistricting following the 2010 United States Census.[2] Five candidates ran for the open seat. In the June 2012 open primary, John Tavaglione, a Republican, ranked first with 45% of the votes. Takano ranked second with 37%.[14] In the November general election, Takano defeated Tavaglione 58%-42%.[15][16] Takano became the first openly gay member of the House who is not white.[3][17][18]
When Representative Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) circulated a draft letter opposing an immigration reform bill in 2013, asking for signatures, Takano marked it up in red pen like a high school assignment and gave it an F, with comments like, ""exaggeration -- avoid hyperbole.""[19] This was followed (in 2015) by a similar response to an Op-ed, written by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), on recent Net Neutrality legislation. In particular Rep.

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is part of the Inland Empire and south Orange County areas of Southern California.


Calvert was born in Corona, California to Marceline Hamblen and Ira D. Calvert, Jr.,[1] and still lives in Corona. In 1970, shortly after high school, he joined the campaigns of former state legislator Victor Veysey. Calvert worked in Veysey's Washington, D.C., office as an intern after a 1972 victory. He graduated from Corona High School in 1971.
Calvert received an associate of arts degree from Chaffey Community College in 1973 and a bachelors of arts degree San Diego State University in 1975. After graduation, he managed his family's restaurant, the Jolly Fox, in Corona for five years. He then entered the real estate industry and ran Ken Calvert Real Properties until he was elected to Congress.
In 1982, the 29 year old Calvert ran for the United States House of Representatives to represent a newly drawn district. He narrowly lost the Republican primary to Riverside County Supervisor Al McCandless, who had been the choice of the Republican establishment. McCandless went on to win the general election.
Calvert was first elected to the House in 1992, when McCandless was re-elected in a different district. Calvert won the general election with 47% of the vote (a plurality, but he was the highest vote-getter), defeating Democrat Mark Takano by 519 votes. In 1994, he was challenged in the Republican primary by Joe Khoury and won renomination by only 51% to 49%. He was re-elected in the 1994 general election with 55 percent, again defeating Takano. Ironically, he now serves in the House alongside his former opponent; Takano was elected to Congress in an adjacent district in 2012.
In 1996, he was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Guy Kimbrough. In 1998 he defeated Democrat Mike Rayburn with 55 percent of the vote. Calvert won again in 2000 with 74 percent of the vote, facing no major-party opposition.
Calvert was re-elected in 2002, defeating Louis Vandenberg with 64 percent of the vote. He defeated Vandenberg again in 2004 with 61 percent of the vote. Vandenberg, a college administrator, was again Calvert's opponent in the November 2006 election.[3] Calvert won with 59.6 percent of the vote; Vandenburg got 37.5 percent.[2]
In 2008, he had a surprisingly close race. He ran against Democratic candidate Bill Hedrick, receiving 51.8% of the vote.[3] Calvert declared victory immediately, but Hedrick waited three weeks before conceding, due to higher than normal turnout prolonging the vote-counting process.[4]
In 2010, Bill Hedrick ran against Calvert again. While most pundits such as Larry Sabato expected him to lose again,[5] sources such as The New York Times ranked the race more competitive. The New York Times has ranked this race as solid Republican, to ""Leaning Republican.[6] "" In the end, Calvert won by a 10% margin.[7]
The National Journal's Cook Political Report named Calvert one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, largely due to his district's rapidly growing Hispanic population.[8] Despite this Calvert defeated opponent Michael Williamson with 60.6% of the vote.[9]
On June 10, 2009, Rep. Calvert introduced H.R. 2788, the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act. This Act designates a national memorial at March Field Air Museum in honor of current and former members of the armed forces who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Rep. Calvert worked to assemble a bipartisan group of 48 cosponsors for this legislation. On March 19, 2010, H.R. 2788 unanimously passed the House of Representatives.[10]
Rep Calvert introduced H. Res. 377, a bill recognizing Armed Forces Day and the exemplary service of the members of the United States Armed Forces on April 29, 2009. This bill received 70 bipartisan cosponsorships and passed the House of Representatives unanimously on May 14, 2009.[11]
Rep. Calvert introduced H. Res. 1219 to support the designation of a National Child Awareness Month to promote awareness of children's charities and youth-serving organizations across the United States on March 25, 2010. Rep Calvert assembled 40 bipartisan cosponsors for this bill and on July 19, 2010 this bill passed the House of Representatives with unanimous support.[12]
Rep. Calvert is the original author of E-Verify, the only employment verification program available to employers to check the work authorization status of newly hired employees. In 1995, Rep. Calvert introduced H.R. 502, which was later included in the immigration reform bill, H.R. 2202.[13] The immigration reforms were later wrapped into the FY1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act.[14] The original program, known as the Basic Pilot Program, was only available to five states and employers used a call in system. In the 12 years since its implementation, the Basic Pilot Program, now known as E-Verify, has expanded nationwide and has over 100,000 employers using the system. Two states, Arizona and Mississippi, have made use of E-Verify mandatory.
E-Verify is 99.6% accurate, free to employers, web-based and 96.1% of checks to the system receive an instant ""green light"" to work. Rep. Calvert has introduced legislation in the 111th Congress to make use of E-Verify mandatory.[15]
As Chairman of the Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, Rep. Calvert introduced H.R. 2828, The Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act, which reauthorizes the CALFED Bay-Delta program. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program is a unique collaboration among 25 state and federal agencies that came together with a mission: to improve Californias water supply and the ecological health of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.[16] H.R. 2828 provides a long-term federal authorization for the western region for water supply and reliability. The bill became Public Law 108-361 [17]
In the 109th Congress, Rep. Calvert served as the Chairman of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee which oversees NASA. As Chairman Rep. Calvert introduced and passed into law the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-155), the first reauthorization bill of civilian space and aeronautics agency in five years. The reauthorization provided NASA with the direction and tools to implement President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration while stressing the importance of their earth and space science and aeronautics work.[18]
The following is an incomplete list of legislation Rep. Calvert sponsored:
Calvert's May 2005 financial disclosure statement showed that he owned eight parcels of land, most in Riverside County, as of December 31, 2004.[20] In 2005, Calvert and Harpole paid $550,000 for a 4.3-acre (17,000m2) parcel just south of March Air Reserve Base. Calvert's real estate firm, where Calvert's brother, Quint, is the president,[21] and Halpole is vice president, received brokerage fees from the seller, Rod Smith of Greeley, Colorado, for representing both buyer and seller in the deal. Less than a year later, Calvert and Harpole sold the property for nearly $1 million. During the time he owned the land, Calvert used the earmarking process to secure $8 million in federal funds for a freeway interchange 16 miles (26km) from the property, and an additional $1.5 million to support commercial development of the area around the base.
In early summer 2005, Harpole bought property with a group of investors at 20330 Temescal Canyon Road, a few blocks from the site of the what was then a proposed interchange at Cajalco and I-15. The purchase price was $975,000. Within six months, after the bill passed that provided federal funding for the interchange, they sold the parcel for $1.45 million. Calvert's firm took a commission on the sale.[20]
On May 19, 2006, The Riverside Press-Enterprise, the sixth largest newspaper in California, editorialized that The Los Angeles Times got the facts wrong and in fact, there was no impropriety on the part of Rep. Calvert.[22] Rep. Calvert has stated that all requests for federal funding come from local entities.
In the spring of 2006, Calvert and Harpole purchased 4 acres (16,000m2) of land from Jurupa Community Services District (JCSD), a water and sewer district in northwestern Riverside County, for $1.2 million, along with five investment partners who jointly had a one-third interest. A newspaper investigation reported in August 2006 that the district apparently never first offered the land to other public agencies, a requirement of state law intended to provide more recreational land. The district's general manager said other agencies were notified, but representatives of those agencies said they received no such notice. The district could not provide evidence of the notification, saying relevant files had been misplaced.
The community services district did not advertise or list the land for sale, a practice required by counties and many other public agencies seeking top dollar on behalf of taxpayers. District general manager Carole McGreevy, who is stepping down from that position in late 2006 and retiring in late 2007, said the district proclaimed the land surplus in the early 1990s after it was no longer needed for flood control. The record of that decision was among the missing documents, as was the updated appraisal that McGreevy said was done in May 2005.
The Calvert partnership plans to build a mini-storage business.[21] In August 2008, the Jurupa Area Recreation and Parks District (JARPD) filed a lawsuit against JCSD, alleging fraud in the sale of the land. In August 2009, the FBI was looking into the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Calvert said he had not been contacted by the FBI or a grand jury and did not believe that he was a focus of any investigation.[23]
The JCSD and JARPD reached a settlement to the dispute on October 7, 2010 and the agreement stated that Stadium Properties, of which Rep. Calvert is one-third silent partner, had no knowledge that the JCSD had not properly noticed the sale of land.[24]
In 1993, two Corona, California, police officers found Calvert with a prostitute in his car. Calvert told the police that he and the woman were ""just talking."" The Press-Enterprise later went to court to force the Corona police to release the police report.[25] After the report was released, Calvert admitted to having sex in his car with the woman, although the police did not have enough evidence to arrest him, as there was no witness to any exchange of money.[26]

"63","","1991","1938","California 43","California State University, Los Angeles","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters","Maxine Waters","Democratic","California State Assembly","unspecified Christian","Maxine Moore Waters (ne Carr; born August 15, 1938) is the U.S. Representative for California's 43rd congressional district, and previously the 35th and 29th districts, serving since 1991. She is a member of the Democratic Party. She is the most senior of the 12 black women currently serving in the United States Congress, and is a member and former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Before becoming a member of Congress she served in the California Assembly, to which she was first elected in 1976. As an Assembly member, Waters advocated for divestment from South Africa's apartheid regime. In Congress, she was an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War. Waters was charged, and exonerated, by the House's subcommittee on ethics with violations of the House's ethics rules in 2010.[1][2][3][4]


The fifth out of thirteen children, Waters was born 1938 in Kinloch, Missouri to Remus and Velma Lee Carr (ne Moore).[5][6] When Maxine Waters was two, her father left the family.[7] She graduated from Vashon High School in St. Louis, and moved with her family to Los Angeles, California, in 1961. She worked in a garment factory and as a telephone operator before being hired as an assistant teacher with the Head Start program at Watts in 1966.[7] She later enrolled at Los Angeles State College (now California State University, Los Angeles) and graduated with a sociology degree in 1970.
In 1973, she went to work as chief deputy to City Councilman David S. Cunningham, Jr.. Waters entered the California State Assembly in 1976. While in the assembly she worked for the divestment of state pension funds from any businesses active in South Africa, a country then operating under the policy of apartheid and helped pass legislation within the guidelines of the divestment campaign's Sullivan Principles.[8] She ascended to the position of Democratic Caucus Chair for the Assembly.[9]
Upon the retirement of Augustus F. Hawkins in 1990, Waters was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for California's 29th congressional district with over 79% of the popular vote. She has been re-elected consistently with at least 70% of the popular vote in the California's 35th congressional district after significant parts of the pre-1990 29th California Congressional District were folded into the newly defined 35th California Congressional District when California gained seven additional seats in the House following the 1990 United States Census.
Waters represented a large part of south-central Los Angeles and the Los Angeles coastal communities of Westchester and Playa Del Rey, and the cities of Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood and Lawndale.
On July 29, 1994, Waters was challenged for remarks made during the House Banking Committees Whitewater hearings denouncing Rep. Peter King, with whom she had argued the night before. She said, Men and women, the day is over when men can badger and intimidate women!""[10][11]
Waters was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1997 to 1998. In 2006 she was involved in the debate over King Drew Medical Center. She criticized media coverage of the hospital and in 2006 Waters asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny a waiver of the cross ownership ban, and hence license renewal for KTLA-TV, a station The Los Angeles Times owned. She said that ""The Los Angeles Times has had an inordinate effect on public opinion and has used it to harm the local community in specific instances."" She requested that the FCC force the paper to either sell its station or risk losing that station's broadcast rights.[12] According to Broadcasting & Cable, the challenges raised ""the specter of costly legal battles to defend station holdings.... At a minimum, defending against one would cost tens of thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees and probably delay license renewal about three months.""[13] Waters' petition was ultimately unsuccessful; the station's license next expires in 2014.[14]
As a Democratic representative in Congress, Waters was a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She endorsed Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in late January 2008, granting the New York Senator nationally recognized support that some suggested would ""make big waves.""[15][16][17] Waters later switched her endorsement to Sen. Barack Obama when his lead in the pledged delegate count became insurmountable on the final day of primary voting.[18]
Waters had a confrontation over an earmark in the United States House Committee on Appropriations with fellow Democratic congressman Dave Obey in 2009. The funding request was for a public school employment training center in Los Angeles that was named after her.[19]
In 2011, Waters voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[20]
With the retirement of Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) in 2012, Waters became the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee.[21][22]
On July 24, 2013, Waters voted in favor of Amendment 100 included in H.R. 2397 Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014.[23] The amendment targeted domestic surveillance activities, specifically that of the National Security Agency, and if ultimately passed would have limited the flexibility of the NSA's interpretation of the law to collect sweeping data on U.S. citizens.[24] Amendment 100 was rejected 217-205.
On March 27, 2014, Waters introduced a discussion draft of the Housing Opportunities Move the Economy Forward Act of 2014 known as the HOME Forward Act of 2014.[25] A key provision of the bill includes the collection of 10 basis points for every dollar outstanding mortgages collateralizing covered securities estimated to be approximately $5 billion a year. These funds would be directed to three funds that support affordable housing initiatives, with 75% going to the National Housing trust fund. The National Housing Trust Fund will then provide block grants to states to be used primarily to build, preserve, rehabilitate, and operate rental housing that is affordable to the lowest income households, and groups including seniors, disabled persons and low income workers. The National Housing Trust was enacted in 2008, but has yet to be funded.[26]
When south-central Los Angeles erupted in riots - in which 58 were killed - after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, Waters gained national attention ""when she helped deliver relief supplies in Watts and demanded the resumption of vital services.""[27][28] Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying ""If you call it a riot it sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable.""[29] In her view, the violence, was a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice. In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: There were mothers who took this as an opportunity to take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes... They are not crooks.[30]
Waters has visited Cuba a number of times, praised Fidel Castro, and demanded an end to the U.S. trade embargo.[31] In 1998 Waters wrote a letter to Castro citing the 1960s and 1970s as a sad and shameful chapter of our history, and thanked Castro for providing help to those who needed to flee political persecution.[32]
In 1998, Waters wrote an open letter to Fidel Castro asking him not to extradite African-American activist Assata Shakur,[33][34] despite the fact that Shakur is an escaped convicted murderer, former member of the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army, and classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a domestic terrorist.
After a woman drowned during an attempted escape from Cuba to the U.S. in 1999, leaving a six-year-old son, Elian Gonzales, who survived and requested asylum in the U.S., Waters called on President Bill Clinton to return him at once to Cuba.[32]
In 2001, Waters called Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a ""plantation owner."" During the L.A. riots in 1992, Waters described the violence as a ""spontaneous reaction to injustice."" She held ""economic, social, cultural, and political"" factors responsible and that the riots should rightly be called a ""rebellion"" or ""insurrection."" [30]
Waters co-sponsored Rep. John Conyers' bill calling for reparations for slavery to be paid to black Americans.[35]
In September 2011, Waters called for the implementation of a federal ""jobs program of a trillion dollars or more.""[citation needed] ""Weve got to put Americans to work"", she said. ""That's the only way to revitalize this economy. When people work they earn money, they spend that money, and that's what gets the economy up and going.""[citation needed]
Waters opposed the 2004 coup d'tat in Haiti and criticized U.S. involvement.[36] Following the coup, Waters led a delegation to the Central African Republic along with TransAfrica Forum founder Randall Robinson and Jamaican member of parliament Sharon Hay-Webster to meet with Aristide and bring him to Jamaica, where he would remain until May.[37][38][39]
Following a 1996 San Jose Mercury article alleging the complicity of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Los Angeles crack epidemic of the 1980s, Waters called for an investigation. Waters questioned whether ""U.S.-government paid or organized operatives smuggled, transported and sold it to American citizens.""[40] The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had failed to find any evidence to support the original story.[41] The Los Angeles Times also concluded after its own extensive investigation that the allegations were not supported by evidence.[42] The author of the original story, Gary Webb, was eventually transferred to a different beat and removed from investigative reporting, before his death in 2004.[43] Mr Gary Webb was found in his apartment with two bullet holes in his head. His death was declared a suicide. Following these post-publication investigations, Waters read into the Congressional Record a memorandum of understanding in which former President Ronald Reagan's CIA director rejected any duty by the CIA to report illegal narcotics trafficking to the Department of Justice.[44][45] Undeterred, Waters told the Los Angeles Times in 1997: ""It doesn't matter whether the CIA delivered the kilo of cocaine themselves or turned their back on it to let somebody else do it. They're guilty just the same."" The same CIA inspector general then released a second volume to this report, wherein his investigative team admitted that CIA assets traded in cocaine and crack, and that the CIA had pressured Department of Justice agencies (such as the DEA and FBI) to drop or suspend their own drug-related investigations of such assets.
Waters voted against the Iraq War Resolution, the 2002 resolution that funded and granted Congressional approval to possible military action against the regime of Saddam Hussein.[46] She has remained a consistent critic of the subsequent war and has supported an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. Waters asserted in 2007 that President George W. Bush was trying to ""set [Congress] up"" by continually requesting funds for an ""occupation"" that is ""draining"" the country of capital, soldier's lives, and other resources. In particular, she argued that the very economic resources being ""wasted"" in Iraq were those that might provide universal health care or fully fund President Bush's own ""No Child Left Behind"" education bill. Additionally, Waters, representing a congressional district whose median income falls far below the national average, argued that patriotism alone had not been the sole driving force for those U.S. service personnel serving in Iraq. Rather, ""many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they're there.""[47] In a subsequent floor speech, Waters told her colleagues that Congress, lacking the votes to override the ""inevitable Bush veto on any Iraq-related legislation"", needed to ""better [challenge] the administration's false rhetoric about the Iraq war"" and ""educate our constituents [about] the connection between the problems in Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran with the problems we have created in Iraq.""[48] A few months prior to these speeches Waters became a cosponsor of the House resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney for making allegedly ""false statements"" about the war.[49]
In August 2008, Waters introduced HR 6796, or the ""Stop Very Unscrupulous Loan Transfers from Underprivileged countries from Rich Exploitive Funds Act"", also known as the Stop VULTURE Funds Act. This would limit the ability of investors in sovereign debt to use U.S. courts to enforce those instruments against a defaulting country. The bill died in committee.[50]
Waters opposes mandatory minimum sentences.[51]
Waters has been very critical of the Tea Party movement. On August 20, 2011, while at a town hall discussing some of the displeasure that supporters of President Obama have had with the Congressional Black Caucus not supporting the president, Waters stated, ""This is a tough game. You cant be intimidated. You cant be frightened. And as far as Im concerned, the tea party can go straight to Hell... and I intend to help them get there.""[52][53]
According to Chuck Neubauer and Ted Rohrlich writing in the LA Times in 2004, Maxine Waters' relatives had made more than $1 million during the preceding eight years by doing business with companies, candidates and causes that Waters had helped. They claimed she and her husband helped a company get government bond business, and her daughter Karen Waters and son Edward Waters have profited from her connections. Waters replied that ""They do their business and I do mine.""[54]
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) named Waters to its list of corrupt members of Congress in its 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2011 reports. She was accused of using her position to prevail upon officials to meet with OneUnited Bank without disclosing that she and her husband had significant stock holdings in the company.[55] Since she was on the Financial Services Committee she largely had the role of determining where TARP funds would go. 12 Million in TARP funds went to OneUnited without her ever disclosing that she had a financial stake at the company.[56][57][58][59] Citizens Against Government Waste named her the June 2009 Porker of the Month due to her intention to obtain an earmark for the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center.[60]
In 2010, Waters came under investigation for ethics violations and was accused by a House panel of at least one ethics violation related to her efforts to help OneUnited Bank, where her husband had been a director and in which he had stock holdings, receive federal aid.[61] Waters' husband is a stockholder and former director of OneUnited Bank and the bank's executives were major contributors to her campaigns. In September 2008, Waters arranged meetings between U.S. Treasury Department officials and OneUnited Bank, so that the bank could plead for federal cash. It had been heavily invested in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and its capital was ""all but wiped out"" after the U.S. government took them over. The bank received $12 million in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) money.[62][63] The matter was investigated by the House Ethics Committee,[64][65] which charged her with violations of the House's ethics rules in 2010 [1][2][3][4] On September 21, 2012, The House Ethics Committee completed a report clearing Waters of all ethics charges after nearly three years of investigation.[66]
Previously, she had served on the Committee on the Judiciary.
Waters resides in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles, which is approximately six miles west of downtown. Her second husband, Sid Williams, played professional football in the NFL[67] and is a former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas under the Clinton Administration.[citation needed] In 1990, Waters, along with 15 other African American women and men, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom.[68]"
"64","","2011*","1952","California 44","Abilene Christian University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_Hahn","Janice Hahn","Democratic","Los Angeles City Council, former businesswoman and teacher","Churches of Christ","Janice Kay Hahn (born March 30, 1952) is the U.S. Representative from California's 44th congressional district and a member of the Democratic Party. She was previously a Los Angeles City Councilwoman representing the 15th district from 2001 to 2011. From 1997 to 1999 she served as an elected representative on the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission.[1]
On July 12, 2011, Hahn won a special election for Congress to fill the seat vacated by Democrat Jane Harman. She defeated Republican Craig Huey, a Tea Party-backed direct marketer from the Torrance area, with 55 percent of the vote to Huey's 45 percent.[2]


Hahn was raised in a politically involved family. She is the daughter of the late Ramona Hahn (ne Fox)[3] and the late Kenneth Hahn, a 40-year Los Angeles County Supervisor who started his career in elective politics as a Los Angeles City Councilman.[4] Her uncle, Gordon Hahn, was a member of the California Assembly and a Los Angeles City Councilman from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Her brother, James Hahn, served as Los Angeles City Controller from 1981 to 1985, City Attorney from 1985 until 2001, and Mayor of Los Angeles from 2001 until 2005.[1][4] Hahn's maternal grandparents served as missionaries in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s.[3]
Hahn attended Abilene Christian University in Texas, earning a bachelor of science in education in 1974.[5] She taught at the Good News Academy, a private school in Westchester from 1974 to 1978.[5] Her other work in the private sector has included Public Affairs Region Manager at Southern California Edison from 1995 to 2000;[5] Vice President for Prudential Securities in Public Finance, Director of Community Outreach for Western Waste Industries, and Director of Marketing for the Alexander Haagen Company.
Hahn was elected to represent the Fifteenth District on the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission, serving from 1997 to 1999.[6] As a Commissioner, she fought for many of the reforms included in the new charter, including Area Planning Commissions, local representation on the citizen commissions governing Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles, and a system of neighborhood councils.[4]
In 1998, U.S. Congresswoman Jane Harman declined to run for re-election, choosing instead to run for Governor of California. Hahn then won the Democratic nomination to succeed Harman, but lost the general election to Republican State Assemblyman Steven T. Kuykendall 49%-47%.[7]
Hahn served on the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 15th District, from 2001 to 2011. The 15th District encompasses the San Pedro Harbor and includes the ethnically diverse communities of Harbor City, Harbor Gateway, San Pedro, Watts and Wilmington.[8] She was reelected to her third and final term in November 2009.[1]
She has been called ""one of the most pro-labor members"" of the City Council, and a ""consistent opponent of layoffs and furloughs for city workers.""[9] Hahn walked the picket lines with unionized dockworkers in 2002.[10] After the Bush administration suggested it would intervene in the labor dispute by using government troops to operate the ports, Hahn urged non-intervention.[10] ""'There's no room for the federal government. There's only one reason for them to get involved, and that's to break the union,' she said.""[10] She was the leading force on the City Council behind both the passage of a living wage ordinance for the hotel workers along Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the provision of improved health benefits to LAX employees.
Hahn cites her efforts to clean up the Port of Los Angeles as one of her main accomplishments while on the City Council.[11] The 2006 Clean Air Action Plan, which she and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed forward, set a goal of reducing pollution by 45 percent within five years and shifted the movement of goods at the ports to off-peak traffic hours.[11] Hahn also supported the addition of the Clean Trucks Program that requires the 16,000 diesel trucks serving the ports meet 2007 EPA emission standards within five years.[11][12] She has noted that the ports have been Southern California's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and diesel emissions and that the Clean Trucks Program also provides for improved working conditions, wages and benefits for port truckers.[12] Prior to the Clean Air Action Plan, she had already shifted about 35% of goods to be moved during off-peak hours. Hahn also helped advance redevelopment projects at the Port of Los Angeles in both San Pedro and Wilmington.
On the City Council, Hahn was a major proponent of gang prevention, intervention, and suppression programs. She led the campaign to pass Measure A, which would have dedicated a sustainable revenue stream for those programs, but fell just shy of the two thirds percentage needed to pass. On a smaller level, she expanded the Gang Alternatives Program to all elementary schools in her district.
Hahn ran for California Lieutenant Governor but was defeated in the primary by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, finishing second in a field of three candidates.[13]
On February 7, 2011, Hahn announced her intention to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the special election to fill California's 36th Congressional District seat vacated by Congresswoman Jane Harman's departure to head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Hahn was one of sixteen candidates from all parties who competed in the special election primary on May 17, 2011.[14] She finished first with 24 percent of the vote; Republican Craig Huey finished second with 22 percent. Because no candidate received more than 50 percent, Hahn and Huey, the top two finishers, faced off in a special runoff election on July 12.[14] Many had expected California Secretary of State Debra Bowen to secure one of the top two spots, but Bowen finished in third place.
The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFLCIO, endorsed Hahn in March 2011, a move the Daily Breeze called ""significant"" because of the fundraising and get out the vote power of the large organization.[15] As of March 23, 2011, Hahn had received endorsements from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, California Assembly Speaker John A. Prez, California State Senator Ted Lieu, Torrance Firefighters Association Local 1138, and other notable figures such as former LA Laker Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and environmentalist and actor Ed Begley, Jr..[16] On April 25, 2011, Hahn secured the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times.[14] Following her victory in the primary, Hahn was endorsed by California Democrats Governor Jerry Brown, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom (who defeated Hahn in the 2010 primary race for Lieutenant Governor), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland.[17] Emily's List, an organization that supports women candidates who support abortion rights also endorsed Hahn.[17] On June 5, 2011, Hahn was officially endorsed by primary opponent Marcy Winograd, California State Controller John Chiang, Assemblyman Warren Furutani and Assemblywoman Betsy Butler, as well as the gun-control group Brady Campaign.
A poll conducted by the Daily Kos and Service Employees International Union shortly before the July 2011 election had Hahn in the lead over Huey by 8 points, (52 percent to 44 percent) with 4 percent undecided.[18] Her final margin of victory was 9 points, 54.56 percent to 45.44.[2]
After redistricting dismantled her old district, Hahn decided to run in the newly redrawn 44th district, which included her home in San Pedro. That district had previously been the 37th, represented by fellow Democratic Congresswoman Laura Richardson. The California Democratic Party endorsed Hahn.[19] In the all-party primary (created as a result of Proposition 14), she finished first over Richardson by a wide margin, taking 60 percent of the vote to Richardson's 40 percent. This was all the more remarkable since Hahn was running in territory that was more than 60 percent new to her. In the general election, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60.2 percent of the vote to Richardson's 39.7 percent.
Some of the awards received by Hahn include the Rosa Parks Award from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Bold Vision Award from the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, the Public Service Award from the African-American Chamber of Commerce, the Recognition Award from the Harbor Area Gang Alternative Program, and enshrinement on the Promenade of Prominence in Watts.[1]
Hahn is a lifelong resident of Los Angeles and lives in San Pedro.[1] She is the mother of three children, the grandmother of five, and a member of the Churches of Christ.[21]"
"65","","2015","1962","California 45","University of California, Los Angeles","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimi_Walters","Mimi Walters","Republican","California State Senate, California State Assembly, Mayor of Laguna Niguel","Roman Catholic","Marian E. Krogius ""Mimi"" Walters (born May 14, 1962) is an American politician who is the U.S. Representative for California's 45th congressional district. A Republican, she was a member of the California State Senate for the 37th District from 2012 to 2015. She previously represented the 33rd Senate District from 2008 to 2012 before redistricting.[citation needed] She also served in the California State Assembly from 2004 to 2008, where she served in the Republican leadership as Assistant Republican Leader and Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee.
On November 4, 2014, Walters was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Californias 45th congressional district, formerly held by John Campbell. She was subsequently elected by her colleagues as the Freshman Class Representative to the House Republican Conference leadership team for the 114th United States Congress.


Walters earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from UCLA in 1984. Before her election to the California State Assembly, Walters was a stockbroker.
Walters was Councilwoman and Mayor of Laguna Niguel during 19962004, and helped defeat efforts to convert Marine Corps Air Station El Toro to a commercial airport.
Walters was elected in 2004 to represent the 73rd Assembly District, which includes coastal Orange and San Diego county communities of Laguna Niguel, Laguna Hills, Oceanside, Dana Point, San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Aliso Viejo.
Since the US Supreme Court decision Kelo v. New London in June 2005, Walters has been at the forefront of amending California government acquisition and the regulation of private property laws. She introduced two bills, AB 590 and AB 1990, in the 2005-06 session on these topics. After both bills failed in committee by party line votes, Walters became a leading figure in the campaign for Proposition 90. She was named honorary chair of the Save Our Homes initiative campaign. Supporters of Proposition 90 referred to their effort as protecting property rights. The initiative received over one million signatures to qualify for the November 2006 ballot. Proposition 90 failed with 47.6% of the vote.
In the 2007-2008 session, Walters introduced ACA 2, a state Constitutional Amendment to change government acquisition and the regulation of private property by California local governments.
Walters introduced a package of bills in February 2011 to address the California pension crisis, SB 520 through SB 528.[2]
In an op-ed written by Senator Walters in October of 2012, Walters questioned the wisdom of creating a state-run retirement pension plan for private-sector workers.[3] The bill, SB 1234, established the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program for private-sector workers that requires employers that may not offer retirement plans to participate in the program.[4]
Walters is the co-founder of the California Womens Leadership Association (CWLA.) She currently serves on the Board of the Orange County Gang Reduction Intervention Program (G.R.I.P.). She has also served on the Boards of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO,) the Laguna Niguel Republican Women Federated, the American Cancer Society, and the South Coast Medical Center Foundation.
In January 2010, Walters announced that she would run for California State Treasurer against Democratic incumbent Bill Lockyer. She became the Republican nominee for State Treasurer the following June.
In early 2012, the Fair Political Practice Commission opened an inquiry as to whether Walters violated conflict-of-interest laws when her office assisted constituents who were having problems receiving feedback from California prison officials regarding the status of a financial claim that Senator Walters husband ultimately had an economic interest in.[5]
The inquiry was disclosed in a written notice to Walters' attorney by Gary Winuk, chief of enforcement for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. He wrote that his office ""will be pursuing an investigation regarding whether or not Sen. Walters violated the Political Reform Act's conflict-of-interest prohibitions.""[6]
The FPPC inquiry ultimately found that there was no wrongdoing on the part of Senator Walters or her staff. [7]
On September 20, 2012, Democratic candidate Steven R. Young filed a petition of extraordinary writ[8] seeking declaratory relief to the California Secretary of State to exclude opponent Mimi Walters from the 2012 election ballot for failing to establish a clear residency status in the district she was running in. Under state law, state legislators are required to live in the districts they represent.[9][10]
Walters and her family have long been associated with Laguna Niguel, where she served on the City Council and was elected to two terms in the Assembly and one in the Senate. But last year, the new California Citizens Redistricting Commission re-drew the states legislative districts. To run in the newly drawn 37th Senate District, Walters says she moved to Irvine. Young and two registered Republicans who have joined in the suit say Walters move was pure fiction. According to the suit, Walters and her husband, David, have lived in a 14,000-square-foot mansion in Laguna Niguel since 1999. Then, this year, the suit says that Walters changed her voter registration to reflect that shes living in a 570-square-foot apartment in Irvine with no dishwasher or washer/dryer hook ups.[11][12]
A Sacramento County Superior Court judge denied Young's petition to have Walters' name removed from the ballot. According to the judge, ""the court doesn't have jurisdiction to hear questions about the qualifications of members of the state Legislature."" [13]
On July 2, 2013, Walters formally announced her candidacy for Congress, replacing Congressman John Campbell, who announced he would not be seeking another term. [14] She was endorsed by a number of Republican Congressmen from California, including Campbell, Kevin McCarthy, Darrell Issa, and Ed Royce.[15] Walters was placed in the National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) ""Contender"" category of their ""Young Guns"" program.[16] In September 2014, the NRCC named Walters along with 13 other candidates to their ""Vanguard"" program.[17] In the nonpartisan blanket primary, she came in first place in a field of three candidates with 44.8% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Democratic candidate Drew Leavens with 65.2% of the vote.[18]
She and her husband, David, live in Bear Brand Ranch in Laguna Niguel with their four children, Katherine, Caroline, David Jr. and Tristan."

Sanchez has represented California's 47th congressional district from 2003 to 2013 and the 46th district from 1997 to 2003. She is a member of the Democratic Party, and a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.[1] The district lies in central Orange County.


Snchez was born in California and was graduated from Katella High School in Anaheim in 1978. Her father was a unionized machinist and her mother worked as a secretary.[citation needed] Her Mexican immigrant parents had seven children.[2] She joined the United Food and Commercial Workers when she worked as an ice cream server in high school, and received a union scholarship to college. She received her undergraduate degree in Economics from Chapman College in Orange in 1982, obtained her MBA from American University in Washington, DC in 1984, and was a financial analyst until entering the House.[3] Sanchez describes herself as growing up a ""shy, quiet girl"" who did not speak English. She credits government with much of her success in public life.[4]
In February 2006, Snchez withdrew from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's political action committee, along with 5 other members, because the caucus chairman, Joe Baca, authorized political contributions to members of his family who were running for state and local offices in California.[5] Sanchez and other CHC members also claim that Baca was improperly elected chairman of the caucus in November 2006 because the vote failed to use secret ballots, as required in the group's bylaws.[6] On January 31, 2007, Sanchez quit the CHC because she claimed that Baca repeatedly treated the group's female members with disrespect. Other female lawmakers have made the same complaint about Baca.[7] In the election for caucus chairman, only one female member of the 23-member Caucus voted to support Baca's candidacy.[8]
According to Loretta Sanchez, Linda Sanchez, and Hilda Solis, Baca also called Loretta Sanchez ""a whore"" while speaking to other lawmakers.[5][9] Baca denied the charge. Politico.com reported that Sanchez claimed California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nez heard the comment from Baca and repeated it to Sanchez, yet Nez claimed not to recall any such comment.[10] Sanchez, however, claimed after the article was published that she had never mentioned Nez to Politico.com.[11]
Snchez has stated she is a moderate Democrat, but, in 2009, Sanchez had a 0% approval rating from the American Conservative Union.[12]
She represents a district in Orange County, long a bastion of suburban conservatism, and is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition; she reportedly voted with Nancy Pelosi 97.8% of the time during the 111th Congress.[13]
Snchez is known for her interests in education, crime, economic development, and protections for senior citizens.[14]
National Journal rated her votes in 2006 in three areas: Economic, Social, and Foreign. The ratings are: Economic = 71 liberal/28 conservative; Social = 80 liberal/19 conservative; Foreign = 70 liberal/28 conservative.[15]
She staunchly opposed the Republicans' Head Start program overhaul in the 108th Congress, invoking her experience growing up poor and challenged by a speech impediment. ""I know about these kids, because I am one of those kids"", she said during debate on the bill. ""It hurts to hear you talk about how we are not successful, or how we are losers. But we are very successful. We have had a lot of successes with Head Start"", she said. Sanchez has asserted that conservative Republicans are not committed to improving public education.[16] When President Bush's 2003 budget proposal threatened to cut education grants, she responded, ""If he can run deficits for the military, then he can run deficits to educate our children.""[4]
Snchez is the second-ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee. She is also a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, and the most senior woman on that committee. Loretta has fought to reform both the law and culture of the U.S. military relating to investigation of sexual crimes, prosecution of sex offenders and care of sexual assault victims. Her leadership contributed to a decision to examine the problem of sexual assault at the military service academies, which revealed that the problem was much more prevalent than previously thought. As a result, she led the fight to change sexual assault provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.[citation needed] In early 2011, Snchez introduced a bill requiring the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue rules governing searches and seizures of the laptops, cellphones, and other electronic devices of American citizens returning to the U.S. from abroad.[17]
Snchez is regarded as a liberal on social issues. She voted against a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and supports abortion rights. She also sought to reverse the ban on abortions at overseas military bases and installations. In August 2000, Sanchez refused to relocate a political fundraiser she had planned at the Playboy Mansion in California. As a result, Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Andrew cancelled her scheduled speaking role at the Democratic National Convention. Sanchez's address was reinstated just before the convention, when she agreed to relocate her fundraiser to Universal Studios.[18]
According to Congressional Quarterly, ""In 2002, Sanchez voted against reviving fast-track procedures for congressional action on trade deals. And, coming from a district with one of the largest ethnically Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam, she voted against a trade agreement with Vietnam, saying that political and human rights conditions in that country needed improvement. Her outspokenness led the Hanoi regime to refuse to allow her into the country late in 2004 when she applied for an entry visa to meet with dissidents.""[4] By April 2006, Sanchez had been denied a visa to visit Vietnam four times by the country's officials.[19] In honor of International Human Rights Day, she joined a bipartisan group of 11 House Members that issued a letter to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung calling for the release of two U.S. citizens arrested by the government of Vietnam.[20]
On October 10, 2002, Sanchez was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq, but she has voted in favor of every appropriation bill for the war in Iraq. She opposed the troop surge in February 2007.[21] On March 7, 2007, Sanchez led a female congressional delegation to visit troops in Iraq. This was her third visit to Iraq.[22]
Snchez has a strong record on supporting human rights and is a member of the bipartisan Congressional Human Rights Caucus. Two major votes include voting yes in 2001 to keep the Cuba travel ban until political prisoners are released, but later voting in 2009 to lift the travel ban unilaterally, and yes to acknowledge the Armenian genocide of the early 1900s.[23] She voted to implement the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007.[24]
Snchez has stated that she was briefly denied access to a United Airlines flight in October 2006 because her name appeared on a no-fly list set up after the September 11 attacks. Sanchez said she was instructed to check in with a United employee, who told her she was on the terrorist watch list. The employee asked her for identification.[citation needed]
In 1994, Snchez ran unsuccessfully for the Anaheim City Council under her then married name, Loretta Brixey.
In 1996, Snchez ran as a moderate Democrat in the 46th District against six-term Republican incumbent Bob Dornan. The bitterly fought race saw Snchez charge that Dornan was out of touch with his constituency, especially after a distracting run for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination. The 46th had always had a Democratic tilt, but became even more Democratic after the 1990 census when it received a considerably larger number of Hispanics than had previously been in the district. Sanchez won by 984 votes, and Dornan contested the election, alleging that many votes were cast by people who were not American citizens. A Congressional investigation found evidence that 624 votes were indeed cast by non-citizens. An additional 124 votes had already been thrown out by California officials. These votes were not enough to throw Sanchez's victory into doubt, so the investigation was halted and the outcome was upheld by a Republican-controlled Congress,[25] making Sanchez the first American of Mexican heritage to represent Orange County in Congress. Dornan continues to assert that illegal voter registration of non-citizens was decisive in Sanchez's victory. In consultation with the INS, the House committee identified as many as 4,700 questionable registration affidavits;[26] but the probe was dropped before these affidavits could be investigated. As Article I Section V of the Constitution of the United States provides that ""Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members"" the investigation was without binding authority.[27]
In a 1998 rematch, she heavily defeated Dornan and has not faced serious opposition since. Her district was renumbered the 47th District after the 2000 census. During that redistricting process, Sanchez hired lobbyist Michael S. Berman, brother of California Democratic Congressman Howard Berman,for ""redistricting consulting"" on her behalf. She paid Berman $20,000 for his work.[28]
In 2006, she defeated Tan D. Nguyen (R) with 62% of the vote.
During California's 2003 gubernatorial recall election, Sanchez was one of the first Democrats to break from Governor Gray Davis and state that a Democrat should run to succeed Davis in case the recall measure passed. Though she recommended that the Democratic candidate be Californias Senior Senator Dianne Feinstein, Sanchez stated that if no other serious Democratic contender stepped forward, she would be willing to run herself. Many California Democrats ultimately adopted Sanchezs position, paving the way for Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to enter the race.[29]
Snchez won against Republican nominee Rosemarie Avila and American Independent Robert Lauten.
Snchez considered running for Governor and for the United States Senate, but declined to enter the gubernatorial race after former Governor Jerry Brown declared his candidacy and deferred to incumbent Senator Barbara Boxer, who ran for re-election.[30]
Snchez was challenged by Republican nominee Van Tran and Independent candidate Ceci Iglesias. According to Roll Call, Sanchez considered running for governor or for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[31] In November 2005, she opened an exploratory committee called People for Loretta 2010.[32] However, in June 2009, she announced she would run for reelection to the House.[33]
In September 2010, Loretta Sanchez appeared on the Spanish language network, Univisin and said that ""the Vietnamese and the Republicans are  with an intensity  trying to take away 'our' seat"", referring to her Vietnamese-born opponent, Van Tran.[34][35][36] Sanchez also described Tran as ""anti-immigrant"".[36]
In September, 2011 Snchez's campaign treasurer, Kinde Durkee, was arrested on suspicion of mail fraud. Sanchez and several others of Durkee's clients found their campaign funds wiped out. Sanchez's chief of staff, Adrienne Elrod, remarked that ""Kinde was someone whose services and counsel we trusted for many years. These charges if true are disheartening and a betrayal by a long time Democratic treasurer for many candidates and committees.[37]
Snchez was re-elected.
Senator Boxer is speculated to retire in the 2016 election and Snchez has not ruled out running for her seat in the U.S. Senate.[30]
In November 2002, Snchez's younger sister, Linda, who is nine years her junior, was elected for the new 39th District. They are the first pair of sisters to serve simultaneously in the United States Congress.
In November 2010, Roll Call and the Orange County Register reported Loretta's engagement to retired Army Colonel Jack Einwechter. Einwechter is currently a lawyer practicing in Washington, D.C. The couple was married on July 16, 2011 in a private ceremony in Orange County, California.
The Hispanic Caucus Controversy (see above) was parodied on The Colbert Report on February 7, 2007.[38]
Loretta Snchez appeared as herself in the September 10, 2007 episode of The Closer entitled ""Til Death Do Us Part, Part II"". Within the fictional narrative of the show, she was briefly seen on the program Larry King Live being interviewed about a criminal legal case."

Hobart College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lowenthal","Alan Lowenthal","Democratic","California State Senate, California State Assembly","Jewish","Alan S. Lowenthal (born March 8, 1941) is an American politician who has been the United States Representative for California's 47th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served in the California State Assembly from 1998 to 2004, representing the 54th Assembly district, and then as a member of the California State Senate, representing the 27th district from 2004 to 2012. In both posts, he represented the city of Long Beach and its surrounding suburbs.


Lowenthal was born and raised in Queens, New York City. He graduated with a B.A. from Hobart College and earned a Ph.D. from Ohio State University. In 1969, Lowenthal moved to Long Beach and became a professor of community psychology at California State University, Long Beach. He went on leave to become a Long Beach City Councilman in 1992. He remained on leave for several years until retiring in 1998.[1]
In 1998, Lowenthal decided to run for the 54th district of the California State Assembly. He defeated Republican nominee Julie Alban 50%-47%.[2] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term defeating Republican nominee Rudy Svorinich, a Los Angeles City Council member, 59%-39%.[3] In 2002, he won re-election to a third term defeating Republican nominee Cesar Castellanos, 60%-40%.[4]
In the Assembly, Lowenthal authored gun control in California that would ban gun selling in people's homes.[5] He was also a founding member of the Assembly's Bipartisan Caucus and authored legislation for the creation of Californias first ever Bipartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission.[6]
In 2004, he decided to run for the California Senate in the 27th Senate district. He won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Cesar Navarro Castellanos 63%-37%.[7] In 2008, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Allen Wood 67%-33%.[8]
The 27th District includes the Los Angeles County communities of Avalon, Long Beach, Signal Hill, Lakewood, Cerritos, Artesia, Bellflower, Downey, South Gate, Lynwood, Paramount, Hawaiian Gardens, Florence-Graham and Willowbrook.
Senator Lowenthal was named Legislator of the Year by the California Firefighters Association in 2002 after he passed a law that limited liability for organizations that donated firefighting equipment. The League of California Cities named him Legislator of the Year in 2001 due to his advocacy on behalf of local governments. He has also received the ""Rivie"" Award from the Friends of the Los Angeles River due to his efforts to help clean up the troubled river. Other legislation that Senator Lowenthal has had signed into law is a law to reduce diesel emissions at the ports by limiting idling time for trucks conducting transactions at the ports, a bill established a grant program to provide financial incentives for purchasing or leasing electric vehicles, and a bill to protects highways.
With Bonnie Lowenthal's election and Alan Lowenthal's reelection in 2008, Senator and Assemblywoman Lowenthal are the first divorced husband and wife to serve concurrently in the California State Legislature (although Senator George and Assemblywoman Sharon Runner, who served concurrently from 2004 to 2008, and Senator Tony and Assemblywoman Audra Strickland, who are serving concurrently with the Lowenthals, were both non-divorced pairs of husbands and wives to serve concurrently).
Lowenthal provided significant commentary throughout the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?.
On November 6, 2012, Lowenthal was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from California's 47th congressional district after defeating Republican Gary DeLong.[12] He took office on January 3, 2013.
His ex-wife, Bonnie Lowenthal, was elected to the California State Assembly in 2008. His son Daniel is an elected judge to the Los Angeles County Superior Court.[13]"

University of Southern California","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher","Dana Rohrabacher","Republican","Special assistant to Ronald Reagan","Baptist","Dana Tyrone Rohrabacher[1] (born June 21, 1947) is the U.S. Representative for California's 48th congressional district, and previously the 46th, 45th and 42nd, serving since 1989. He is a member of the Republican Party.
He chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and emerging threats. He is known for his long-time friendship with Russia's Vladimir Putin and his support for Russian positions in European affairs.[2]
Rohrabacher's district covers the areas of Seal Beach, Sunset Beach, Huntington Beach, Midway City, parts of Westminster, Fountain Valley, parts of Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Beach, and Laguna Niguel.[3]


Rohrabacher, who is of German descent, was born June 21, 1947, in Coronado, California, the son of Doris M. (ne Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. Rohrabacher has a long history in Orange County. Rohrabacher attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach.
Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. While in graduate school and during the early 1970s, he had a side activity as a folk singer.[citation needed] He was also a writer for the Orange County Register.[4] During this time he was considered as a free market anarchist and libertarian activist after his previous membership in Young Americans for Freedom. Libertarian Samuel Konkin recalled that: The final step toward my libertarianism was provided by an anti-communist free-market anarchist named Dana Rohrabacher at the St. Louis YAF Convention. He was a charismatic campus activist, radicalized by Robert LeFevre who provided him with small funding to travel the country with his instrument and folk songs from campus to campus, converting YAF chapters into Libertarian Alliances and SIL chapters. Alas, later he fell into politics, but not the LP. The Libertarian billionaire Charles Koch supported him in two failed Republicans primary campaigns, and after Rohrabacher put in time as Ronald Reagan's speechwriter, he got his reward of a safe seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Orange County. He is still in office today, with growing seniority. There are few issues on which he is still Libertarian, certainly fewer than, say, Ron Paul holds.But in 1969-71, Dana Rohrabacher was the most successful and most beloved Libertarian activist, and, in my opinion, there would not have been a Movement without him. And he was a close friend of mine until he crossed the line with his campaign for Congress.""[5]
Rohrabacher served as assistant press secretary to the 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan.[6] From 1981 to 1988, he was one of President Reagan's senior speech writers. During his tenure at the White House, Rohrabacher played a leading role in the formulation of the Reagan Doctrine.[citation needed] He also helped formulate President Reagan's Economic Bill of Rights, which was a series of policy proposals that Reagan introduced in a speech at the Jefferson Memorial.
Rohrabacher left the Reagan administration in 1988 to pursue the open House seat recently vacated by Dan Lungren. With the fundraising help of friend Oliver North, Rohrabacher was able to win the Republican primary with a plurality of 35%.[7] He won the general election with 64%.[8] He only had serious primary competition twice, in 1992 and 1998. After redistricting, he won a three candidate primary election in 1992 with a plurality of 48%.[9] In 1998, he won an open primary with 54% of the vote.[10][11] As far as general elections, he only dipped below 55.0% once (2008).
He defeated Democratic nominee Debbie Cook, Mayor of Huntington Beach, 53%43%, the lowest winning percentage of Rohrabacher's career.[12]
He defeated Democratic nominee Ken Arnold 62%38%.[13]
After redistricting, he announced that he would run in the newly redrawn California's 48th congressional district. He said ""The new 48th District is a good fit and something that will enable me to serve my constituents and the country well.""[14] He won re-election in this Orange County district with 61% of the vote.
A friend and fellow White House aide, Christopher Cox, won a southern Orange County seat in the same election.
In 2011, Rohrabacher voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[15]
During a trip to Iraq in June 2011, he said that Iraq should pay back the U.S. for all the money it had spent since the invasion, when it becomes a wealthy country. Rohrabacher also commented he would be holding a hearing with the Sub-Committee on Oversight and Investigations into if Iraq committed ""crimes against humanity"" at Camp Ashraf when a massacre occurred last April. The incident left 34 residents killed and over 300 wounded. The delegation was denied access to the camp by Iraqi government, citing their sovereignty. Rohrabacher's delegation was subsequently asked to leave the country.[16][17]
On November 4, 2005, the Los Angeles Times reported that Rohrabacher was paid 23,000 dollars for a thirty year old screen play of his. At issue was whether the producer paid him for the screenplay or for the introductions to congressional and federal officials. Rohrabacher claims that the introductions were made in good faith, were nothing that was not done regularly for legitimate causes, and that the introductions have only become an issue because of Joseph Medawar's alleged misdeeds.[18]
In May 2006, Rohrabacher announced through his press secretary that he would return the $23,000. The decision was made public shortly before Medawar took responsibility in a United States District Court for bilking $3.4 million from about 50 investors.[19]
In a debate at Orange Coast College, he voiced his support for Proposition 8, which defines marriage in California as only between a man and a woman, and said that he ""would suggest not changing the definition of marriage in our society to make a small number of people feel more comfortable.""[20]
Rohrabacher chaired the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee from 1997 until January 2005; he received a two-year waiver to serve beyond the six-year term limit.
As a senior member of the International Relations Committee, Rohrabacher led the effort to deny Most Favored Nation trading status to the People's Republic of China, citing that nation's dismal human rights record and opposition to democracy. His subcommittee assignments are East Asia and Pacific, and Middle East and South Asia.
Rohrabacher's interest in Afghanistan extends back at least to the late 80s, before his time in office, when he entered the country in the company of mujahedin fighters who were intent on confronting Soviet occupation forces. Reportedly, these fighters ""actually engaged Soviet troops in combat near the city of Jalalabad during the two months Rohrabacher was with them.""[21] In 2003, he defended the new Afghan constitution against those who saw in it mainly empowerment of warlords, saying
I've heard a lot of negative posturing about...these people who happened to have been the guys who sided with the United States ...Dostam, Atta, Khan...these were the people who defeated the Taliban... Just keep that in mind if you're an American. They came to help us defeat people who slaughtered our own people [September 11, 2001]. And I'm grateful for that. And I'm not about to label them in these pejorative terms [as warlords], especially when the Taliban are still on the border...I would admonish [you] not to go so quickly in getting rid of people who helped us defeat the Taliban.[22]
Rohrabacher has since become a proponent of withdrawing from Afghanistan. He protested against the troop build up to Afghanistan by President Obama saying ""If the Taliban is going is be defeated, it's got to be by the Afghan people themselves, not by sending more U.S. troops, which could actually be counterproductive.""[23] When Congressman Jim McGovern offered an amendment earlier this year requiring the Pentagon to draw up an exit plan from Afghanistan, Rohrabacher was just one of six Republicans to sign on. Rohrabacher further voted for McGovern's Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, requiring an exit plan from Afghanistan. The bill failed by 204215 margin.[24]
Rohrabacher is against President Obama's gradual draw down of troops supporting a full withdrawal. Saying If were going to leave, we should leave."" Rohrabacher has gone on to state The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave, continued Rohrabacher. So lets quit prolonging the agony and inevitable. Karzais regime is corrupt and non representative of Afghanistans tribal culture. This failed strategy is not worth one more drop of American blood. Under the current strategy, our military presence alienates more Afghans that it pacifies. So if youre going to pull the plug, then we need to get the hell out now. [25] Rohrabacher has repeatedly raised high-level concerns in the US Congress and Washington, D.C., about the significant corruption in Afghanistan, including the Kabul Bank scandal where hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars allegedly disappeared in a short period of time at the apparent hands of close Karzai family members, including brothers Mahmoud Karzai (a.k.a. Mahmood Karzai), Ahmed Wali Karzai and others. Rohrabacher worked to bring attention to the systemic corruption in the Karzai government and cut U.S. taxpayers' funding for these wasteful projects and programs, involving corruption within the Hamid Karzai government.
In April 2012, CNN reported that ""A top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee was asked by the State Department not to go to Afghanistan because President Hamid Karzai objected to the visit. ... Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told Security Clearance he was readying to travel with five other Republicans from Dubai to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, when the State Department requested he stay behind.""[26]
Rohrabacher voted in support of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002,[27] a position that he later admitted was ""a mistake.""[28]
In August 2012, Rohrabacher noted on his official website that he had written a letter written to the U.S. State Department noting he supported U.S. sponsorship of separatist movements in Iran, which elicited criticism from the Iranian-American community that included challenging Rohrabacher's understanding of the historical background he included in his letter to the Department of State.[29]
During a US Congressional delegation's visit to Uzbekistan in February 2013, Rohrabacher made several controversial statements. The chief among those statements was that the United States should treat Uzbekistan like Saudi Arabia by disregarding the former's human rights abuses in achieving America's national interests, particularly in selling armaments and drones to Uzbekistan. [30]
Rohrabacher is a huge opponent of the America Invents Act, a bill that is attempting to change the current Patent System. Rohrabacher opposes changing from a ""first to invent system"" to a ""first to file system"" claiming it ""hurts the little guy."" Rohrabacher commented ""Make no mistake, first to file weakens patent protection. It is likely to make vulnerable individual and small inventors, who dont have an army of lawyers on retainer. These little guys have been the lifeblood of American progress and competitiveness for more than 200 years. Our system was designed to protect individual rights, and it has worked for all  not just the corporate elite."" Rohrabacher went on to comment in a Politico article ""Were told this is necessary to harmonize with Japanese and European patent law. But those systems were established by elitists and economic shoguns interested in corporate power, not individual rights.""[31]
Rohrabacher is a supporter of the medicinal use of marijuana as a right of the state. He and Maurice Hinchey have jointly offered the Hinchey-Rohrabacher medical marijuana amendment to a Commerce Justice and Science appropriations bill that would prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting patients in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes.[32] Rohrabacher said that conservatives should take states' rights into consideration when they consider the issue of marijuana. In July 2014, Rohrabacher announced his support for the legalization of marijuana for recreational use in the state of California.[33]
Rohrabacher was chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics from 1997 to January 2005[34] and has been active on space-related issues. In 2000, Space.com described Rohrabacher as ""a strident advocate for supremacy in space, a philosophy shaped along a winding road from libertarian activist to White House speech writer in the Reagan administration."" In 2007, Rohrabacher introduced a bill that would direct NASA to develop a strategy for deflecting and mitigating potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.[35] Rohrabacher has applauded the Apollo astronauts claiming them as unofficial ambassadors. Rohrabacher stated I applaud their efforts and accomplishments over the past fifty years. And I encourage all Americans to join with me in thanking them for their accomplishments and for the international role they have played in serving as unofficial Ambassadors to the world on our behalf.[36]
In May 2011 Rohrabacher introduced a bill to stop aid to Pakistan in the wake of Osama Bin Laden's death, claiming the Pakistani's were either sheltering Bin Laden or completely incompetent. We can no longer afford this foolishness, said Rohrabacher. The time has come for us to stop subsidizing those who actively oppose us. Pakistan has shown itself not to be Americas ally. Rohrabacher also demanded the return of the US helicopter that crashed in the operation to kill Bin Laden. If this is not done immediately, it is probable, given Pakistans history, that our technology has already found its way into the hands of the Communist Chinese military that is buying, building, and stealing the necessary military technology to challenge the United States, Rohrabacher stated.[37]
In February 2013, Rohrabacher gave a poignant speech urging the right to self-determination for the Baloch people in Pakistan at a UNPO conference in London.[38]
In March 2005, Rohrabacher introduced HR 1061, the American Property Claims Against Ethiopia Act, which would ""prohibit United States assistance to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia until the Ethiopian government returns all property of United States citizens."" The bill was introduced by Rohrabacher at the behest of Gebremedhin Berhane, a former Eritrean national and friend of the Rohrabacher family, after his business was expropriated by the Ethiopian government.
On March 7, 2006, Rohrabacher introduced HR 4895, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, ""to limit the provision of the United States military assistance and the sale, transfer, or licensing of United States military equipment or technology to Ethiopia."" [39]
On September 8, 2008, at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, Rorabacher argued that the Georgians had initiated the recent military confrontation in the ongoing Russian-South Ossetian conflict. [40] [41] .[42]
During an appearance on MSNBC's The Ed Show, Rohrabacher accused Barack Obama of allowing violence in Iran to get out of hand because he did not speak forcefully enough against the country's leadership. He also claimed that Gorbachev tore down the Berlin Wall because Reagan told him to (Tear down this wall).[43]
In early 2010, he went to Honduras to commend the election of the new president. His entourage included a group of Californian property investors and businessmen, a dealer in rare coins, and CEOs from San Diego biofuels corporation (which is headed by a family friend).[44]
Rohrabacher was opposed to American ground troops in the Yugoslav Wars. He advocated for the direct bombing of the Serb military on Serbian soil, criticizing the ineffectiveness of western forces against the Serbs, NATO was limited to small fixed attacks, as the Serbs penetrated UN safe areas and attacked Bosnian forces. Rohrabacher said they ""should bomb Serbia's military infrastructure, in Serbia  get that, in Serbia  rather than dropping a couple of duds on tents, which only proves the West's gutlessness, and emboldens Serbian cutthroats.""[45][46] Rohrabacher considered the events in Bosnia to constitute genocide.[47] In 1995, Rohrabacher personally visited Sarajevo in Bosnia, criticizing the devastation Serb forces inflicted on the city, saying ""This is a loss to all mankind, not just to the people of Sarajevo,"". He also encountered vagabond children asking for money.[48]
The leader of the Albanian American Civic League ethnic lobby group, Joseph J. DioGuardi, praised Rohrabacher for his support to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), saying ""He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosova Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosova.""[49] Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War, saying ""Based on our own experience, the Kosova Liberation Army should have been armed."" ""If the U.S. had armed the KLA in 1998, we would not be where we are today. The 'freedom fighters' would have secured their freedom and Kosova would be independent."" [50]
Rohrabacher voiced support for the Taliban when they seized power in the 1990s, visiting Afghanistan when it came under their control, saying that the Taliban would provide ""stability"", and eliminate threats to the United States. He also claimed the Taliban ""intend to establish a disciplined, moral society"". He said he believed complete Taliban control over Afghanistan would be a ""positive development"", that they were ""devout traditionalists, not terrorists or revolutionaries"", and that ""sensationalist"" media coverage of the Taliban's introduction of Sharia law was ""nonsense"".[51][not in citation given] Later, during the Clinton administration, he was critical of the Taliban for harboring Osama Bin Laden.[52]
In 2007 Rohrabacher supported Mohiuddin Ahmed, detained in the USA, who was involved in a coup in Bangladesh during which several people were murdered. Rohrabacher halted his deportation to Bangladesh when they requested his extradition and voiced concern about his legal rights, saying that he should be sent somewhere with no death penalty. His support was applauded by both Amnesty International and the Conference of Catholic Bishops.[53][54]
On April 17, 2007, while defending the Bush administration's program of extraordinary rendition. During a House hearing on trans-atlantic relations, Rohrabacher stated that the unfair treatment of one innocent suspect is an acceptable ""unfortunate consequence"" of holding others who would otherwise be free to commit terror acts. After he received boos and groans from the gallery, Rohrabacher responded, ""Well, I hope it's your families, I hope it's your families that suffer the consequences"", and ""I hope it's your family members that die"". Rohrabacher was subsequently interrupted by protesters wearing orange jumpsuits who were removed from the gallery. For his comment that imprisoning and torturing one innocent person was a fair price to pay for locking up 50 terrorists who would ""go out and plant a bomb and kill 20,000 people,"" Rohrabacher was named Countdown with Keith Olbermann's ""Worst Person in the World"" on April 25.[55][56]
In 2006, Rohrabacher chaired the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the U.S. House Committee on International Relations, which investigated whether the Oklahoma City bombers had assistance from foreign sources and determined there was no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection.[57][58] In the 113th Congress, Rohrabacher is chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.
Rohrabacher has stated that he sees radical Islam as the source of a major terrorist threat to the U.S.[59] Speaking about radical Islam he said during a hearing in April 2013, ""I hope we all work together against a religion that will motivate people to murder children and other threats to us as a civilization.""[60]
In 2014, Rohrabacher suggested that Iraq's borders be redrawn in response to the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[61]
Rohrabacher was an advocate for the state of California's Proposition 187, which prohibited illegal immigrants from acquiring government services. In 2004, he sponsored an amendment that would have prohibited federal reimbursement of hospital-provided emergency care and certain transportation services to undocumented aliens unless the hospital provided information about the aliens' citizenship, immigration status, financial data, and employer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Aliens who were in the country illegally would receive reimbursement only after they were deported. The proposed bill was defeated 88  331.[62]
In early 2008, Rohrabacher endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican presidential primary, citing his positions on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing John McCain. About McCain, he said, ""He's been the enemy of those of us who have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments.""[63]
In 2011 Rohrabacher proposed the bill H.R. 787 known as the ""No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011."" The bill ""Amends title II of the Social Security Act to exclude from creditable wages and self-employment income any wages earned for services by aliens performed in the United States, and self-employment income derived from a trade or business conducted in the United States, while the alien was not authorized to be so employed or to perform a function or service in such a trade or business.""[64]
In 2013, an 18 year old student visited Rohrabacher's office to discuss immigration reform. At some point their conversation became disagreeable, and the student claims the congressman yelled at her ""I hate illegals,"" and threatened to deport her family, statements which Rohrabacher's spokesperson has disputed. The spokesperson claims that it was the student who started the confrontation by yelling at her and telling her to ""butt out."" [65]
Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by ""dinosaur flatulence.""[66] He stated, ""In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress."" On May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming. However, he suggested that if it is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and possibly replanting. This was strongly criticized by scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming.[67][68] In response, Rohrabacher stated,
Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that Im advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position.""[69]
Rohrabacher supported the right of Crimea to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in 2014. On March 6, 2014, he was one of 23 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a $1billion loan guarantee to support the new government of Ukraine.[70] In the March 11, 2014, House of Representatives vote (402 voting yes; 7 opposed) to condemn Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty, Rohrabacher voted ""present."" Commenting on the issue, he stated, ""Starting with our own American Revolution, groups of people have declared themselves, rightfully, to be under a different government or a government of their choosing. People forget thats what our Declaration of Independence is all about."" He also said, ""The sanctions are an abomination of hypocrisy. This is ridiculous: What we were doing with the violence and military action we took to secure the Kosovars right to self-determination was far more destructive and had far more loss of life than what Putins done trying to ensure the people of Crimea are not cut off from what they would choose as their destiny with Russia.""[71]
Rohrabacher is married to his campaign manager, Rhonda. They have been married since 1997, and in 2004 they became parents to triplets: Annika, Christian and Tristen.[72]
Rohrabacher was described by the Los Angeles Times as ""an avid surfer.""[73]"
"69","","2001","1953","California 49","Kent State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Issa","Darrell Issa","Republican","Electronics executive","Eastern Orthodox","Darrell Edward Issa (/as/; born November 1, 1953) is the Republican U.S. Representative for California's 49th congressional district, serving since 2001. The district (numbered the 48th District during his first term) covers the northern coastal areas of San Diego County, including cities such as Oceanside, Vista, Carlsbad and Encinitas, as well as a small portion of southern Orange County.[3] Since January 2011, he has served as Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Issa was formerly a businessman. He was CEO of Directed Electronics, a Vista, California-based manufacturer that is one of the largest makers of automobile aftermarket security and convenience products. Issa is a multi-millionaire with a net worth estimated at as much as $450 million (in 2013), which makes him the wealthiest currently-serving member of Congress.[4][5][6]


Issa, the second of six children, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Martha (ne Bielfelt) and William Issa, who sold trucks and ground valves.[7][8] His father was Eastern Orthodox and his mother was a Mormon.[9] His paternal grandparents were Lebanese immigrants who both belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, also known as Antiochian Orthodox,[10] and his mother is of German and Bohemian (Czech) descent.[11][12] In 2006, he was one of four Arab-American members of Congress.[13]
The family moved to the predominantly Jewish suburb of Cleveland Heights in the later years of his childhood. Many of his friends were Jewish, and Issa reportedly worked for a rabbi at one point. He became very familiar with Jewish culture.[9]
On his 17th birthday, he dropped out of high school and enlisted for three years in the Army.[9][14] He became an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technician assigned to the 145th Ordnance Detachment.[15] Trained to defuse bombs, Issa claimed his unit provided security for President Richard Nixon, sweeping stadiums for bombs prior to games in the 1971 World Series.[16] A May 1998 investigation by Lance Williams of the San Francisco Examiner said Nixon had not attended any of that year's World Series games. Issa's unit did perform security sweeps for the World Series. The investigation revealed that after the World Series Issa was transferred to a supply depot after receiving poor ratings. According to Issa, the Examiner reporter misunderstood an anecdote he had related.[9]
A fellow soldier, Jay Bergey, claimed Issa stole his Dodge Charger in 1971, and that ""I confronted Issa ... I got in his face and threatened to kill him, and magically my car reappeared the next day, abandoned on the turnpike."" No charges were ever filed. Issa has denied any theft.[9]
After receiving a hardship discharge in 1972 after his father suffered a heart attack, Issa earned a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.[9] Twice that year, he was arrested. In the first incident he was indicted by a grand jury for an alleged theft of a Maserati, but prosecutors dropped the charge.[17] In the second incident, he was stopped for driving the wrong way on a one-way street, and a police officer noticed a firearm in his glove compartment. Issa was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. He pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was sentenced to six months' probation and a small fine.[17] Issa has said he believes the record has since been expunged.[9]
Issa attended Siena Heights University, a small Roman Catholic college in Adrian, Michigan, followed by Kent State University at Stark, where he enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.[9] He served in the Army Reserve from 1976 to 1980 and was promoted to the rank of captain.[18] While serving on active duty for training with the 1/77th Armor Battalion as an Assistant S-1 from September 9 to 26, 1980, he received an evaluation report by then-Lt. Col. Wesley Clark, who wrote ""This officer's performance far exceeded that of any other reserve officer who has worked in the battalion"" and ""Promote ahead of contemporaries. Unlimited potential.""[9][19][20]
Shortly before his discharge in 1980, Issa was again indicted for grand theft auto. According to court documents, his brother, William Issa, had gone to a used car dealer and offered to sell his brother's car, a 1976 Mercedes sedan, while impersonating his brother. With an Ohio driver's license belonging to Darrell, William was given $16,000 for the car from the dealer. Shortly after the sale, Darrell reported the car stolen and told the police that he had left the title in the trunk. During the investigation Darrell reportedly gave conflicting statements as to whether or not he had recently obtained a replacement driver's license.[citation needed] The brothers were indicted for grand theft. Darrell claimed he had no knowledge of his brother's impersonation and sale, while William claimed that his brother had authorized him to sell the car. As the investigation continued, Darrell went to the dealership the car was sold to and repurchased his car. A few months later, investigators dropped the charges against him. In 1981 in Cleveland, Darrell Issa crashed a truck he was driving into another motorist's car and, according to court records, Issa told her that he did not have time to wait for the police and left the scene. The other motorist sued Issa for $20,000; they eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[9]
After leaving the military, Issa and his second wife, Kathy Stanton, moved back to the Cleveland area. According to Issa, he and his wife pooled their savings, sold their cars: a 1976 Mercedes and a 1967 VW Beetle as well as a BMW motorcycle and borrowed $50,000 from family members to invest in Quantum Enterprises, an electronics manufacturer run by a friend from Cleveland Heights that assembled bug zappers, CB radio parts and other consumer products for other companies. One of those clients, car alarm manufacturer Steal Stopper, would become the path to Issa's fortune. It was struggling badly, and he took control of it by foreclosing a $60,000 loan he had made to it when its founder, Joey Adkins, missed a payment. Adkins remained as an employee.[9]
Issa soon turned Steal Stopper around, to the point that it was supplying Ford with thousands of car alarms and negotiating a similar deal with Toyota. But early in the morning of September 7, 1982, the offices and factory of Quantum and Steal Stopper in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights caught fire. The fire took three hours to put out. The buildings and almost all the inventory within were destroyed. An investigation of the cause of the fire noted ""suspicious burn patterns"" with fires starting in two places aided by an accelerant such as gasoline.[9]
Adkins said Issa appeared to prepare for a fire by increasing the fire insurance policy by 462% three weeks previously, and by removing computer equipment holding accounting and customer information. St. Paul Insurance, suspicious of arson and insurance fraud, initially paid only $25,000, according to Issa.[9] [21]
Steal Stopper soon regained its previous prosperity. As car theft rose in the United States during the 1980s, so did the demand for security devices. Rolls Royce, BMW, and General Motors joined Ford and Toyota as customers. In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of home alarms, and moved to the San Diego suburb of Vista, where he has lived ever since, to work for the company. Shortly afterward he left to start Directed Electronics, Inc. (DEI).[9]
Issa was able to use his knowledge of the weaknesses in automotive security that car thieves preyed on to develop effective theft deterrents. Using sensors that would detect motion and pressure on the body of the car when armed, his design would create loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car's horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa's voice saying: ""Protected by Viper. Stand back"" and ""Please step away from the car"", warning for DEI's signature product, the Viper car alarm.[22] Sales grew from a million dollars its first year to $14 million by 1989.[9] DEI diversified, and eventually became one of the largest makers of aftermarket electronic automotive accessories in the U.S. As of 2004, Directed Electronics was North America's largest aftermarket automotive electronics manufacturer. Issa divested personal interest in Directed Electronics after being elected to public office.[citation needed]
From his involvement in consumer-electronics trade organizations, he started becoming politically active. He went to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and became one of California's largest individual campaign contributors to Republican candidates. In 1996, he was chairman of the successful campaign to pass California Proposition 209, a ballot initiative which prohibited public institutions in California from considering race, sex, or ethnicity in the areas of public employment, public contracting or public education. He was instrumental in persuading the national Republican Party to hold its 1996 convention in San Diego.[2][9]
Issa's first campaign for elected office came in 1998, when he sought the Republican nomination for United States Senate to run against incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. He backed the campaign with $10 million of his personal wealth, but lost the primary election to California State Treasurer Matt Fong. Fong's campaign raised $3 million from contributions and complained that Issa's wealth made for an uneven playing field (Issa had only $400,000 in contributions). An Issa spokesman countered that the money was needed to compensate for Fong's statewide name recognition.[23] Fong defeated Issa 22%-20%. A San Francisco exit poll suggested large numbers of Asian-Americans, who typically vote in the Democratic party primary, had crossed party lines to vote for Fong.[24]
Nine-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Ron Packard decided to retire two years after Issa's senate bid. Issa capitalized on his name recognition from the 1998 Senate race and decided to run for California's 48th congressional district. The district was primarily based in San Diego County, but did have small portions in Riverside and Orange counties. He finished first in the all-party primary with 35% of the vote, winning a plurality in all three counties. He defeated Republican State Senator Bill Morrow, who got just 24% of the votes.[25][26] He won the November general election, defeating Democratic nominee Peter Kouvelis 61%-28%.[27][28]
After redistricting, Issa's district was renumbered as the 49th District. He lost his share of Orange County. Like its predecessor, this district was heavily Republican; it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of R+10. No Democrat filed against him that year. He won re-election to a second term, defeating Libertarian nominee Karl Dietrich 77%-22%.[29]
A write-in candidate from the 2002 election, Mike Byron, went on to become the Democratic challenger in 2004.[30] Issa won re-election to a third term, defeating Byron 63%-35%.[31]
Issa won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee Jeeni Criscenzo, 63%-33%.[32]
Issa won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Robert Hamilton, 58%-37%. The 21-point margin of victory was the second smallest in his career. He carried San Diego with 60% of the vote and Riverside with 57% of the vote.[33]
Issa won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Democratic nominee Howard Katz 63%-31%.[34]
After redistricting, Issa ran in the newly redrawn 49th district. It lost its share of Riverside County, along with most of its share of inland San Diego County. In their place, a small portion of Orange County was added. The new 49th was approximately six points less Republican than its predecessor. The old 49th had a PVI of R+10, making it the most Republican district of the five that divide San Diego. The new 49th, however, has a PVI of R+4.
Issa won re-election to a seventh term, defeating the Democratic nominee, Jerry Tetalman, 58%-42%. The sixteen-point margin of victory was the smallest in Issa's political career. He carried the San Diego part with just 55% of the vote, while he dominated the Orange County part with 66% of the vote.[35][36]
The open primary in June was contested by Issa and two Democrats: Dave Peiser and Noboru Isaga. The top two vote getters, Issa (62%) and Peiser (28%), advanced to the general election.[37][38] In the November election Issa was elected to an eighth term, 60% to 40%.[39][40]
Issa has voted with the majority of House Republicans 94.7% of the time during the 111th Congress.[41]
He opposes abortion and supports stem cell research, saying that ""The promise of stem cells to provide innovative treatments and cures warrants investment in more advanced research"".[42]
In 2001 Issa voted for the authorization of the PATRIOT Act and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.[43] He voted for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2005 after successfully amending it to require judicial notification, reporting requirements and facts justifying the use of roving survelliance at new facilities or places.[44]
He voted against the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit employers from discriminating on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation.[45]
He has opposed attempts to ease restrictions on illegal immigration such as the ""Blue Card"" system, arguing that it provides amnesty for illegal immigrants.[46]
Issa has said he supports efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He voted against a cap and trade bill designed to cut them.[47] Issa believes that ""the science community does not agree to the extent of the problem or the critical threshold of when this problem is truly catastrophic.""[48]
He has been critical of No Child Left Behind, supporting a modification that would, in his words, ""give states the freedom to adopt best practices for their students by returning flexibility and control to the educators and parents who are the real experts on education"".[49]
He signed the ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge"" of the Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that opposes all tax increases.[50]
He is opposed to the Stop Online Piracy Act based on the amount of discretion the Department of Justice would have under the legislation as it is currently drafted. He plans to propose amendments that would reduce that discretion.[51] Issa subsequently went on to cosponsor the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.[52]
He co-sponsored both the 2008 and 2009 versions (H.R. 6845 and H.R. 801, respectively) of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act and sponsored the Research Works Act (H.R. 3699) introduced in 2011, all of which aim at a reversal of the NIH's Public Access Policy,[53] which mandates open access to NIH-funded research.[54]
He endorsed Mitt Romney's candidacy for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election.[55]
Issa supported the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (S. 994; 113th Congress), a bill that aims to make information on federal expenditures more easily accessible and transparent.[56] While ultimately it was the Senate version of the bill that passed the Senate and then the House, Issa was responsible for introducing the Senate bill's companion House version, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 2061; 113th Congress).[57]
Issa supported a bill to allow a slightly taller height limit for penthouses in the District of Columbia.[58]
On March 11, 2014, Issa introduced the Smart Savings Act (H.R. 4193; 113th Congress), a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).[59] Issa said that the bill ""will ensure that workers who are planning ahead for retirement are investing in an account that works for them at every stage of their career.""[60]
Issa also introduced the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress) on March 11, 2014.[61] The bill would require the Federal Register to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the Federal Register be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form.[61]
Issa supported the All Circuit Review Extension Act (H.R. 4197; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals.[62][63] Issa argued that ""whistleblowers are a critical asset for congressional oversight"" and that extending the pilot program would give Congress ""more time to gauge the impact of an 'all circuit' review.""[63]
In 2001, Issa's district office in San Clemente was targeted in an aborted bombing plot. Jewish Defense League leader Irving Rubin was arrested along with Earl Krugel in connection with the plot, which reportedly had focused on other targets before shifting to Issa's office.[11][64]
Issa speculated that the cause of the incident may have been a column written by political commentator Debbie Schlussel in which she charged that Issa sympathized with Hezbollah despite its being listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization, charges he denied.[11][65][66]
In September 2011, the liberal advocacy group American Family Voices filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics against Issa, alleging he had repeatedly used his public office for personal financial gain. Issa's office rejected the allegations.[67]
The year before that the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, awarded Issa with its Good Government Award for his contributions to government oversight and transparency. These included publicizing documents produced by the New York Federal Reserve Bank in response to a congressional subpoena, publicly exposing the NYFR's secret ""back-door bailout"" of AIG's counterparties, and cofounding a Transparency Caucus dedicated to ""promoting a more open and accountable government through education, legislation, and oversight.""[68][69]
Issa is one of a few Lebanese-Americans in Congress. a total of five as of 2006,[70] and has had a significant role in U.S. peace initiatives in the Middle East. He traveled to Lebanon and Syria in an effort to negotiate the end of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2003, he appeared at a Washington rally by Iranian groups protesting against the Islamic government in Iran.[71]
Issa supported the use of military force in Iraq (2002)[72] and Afghanistan. On June 16, 2006, he voted to reject setting timetables for withdrawal from Iraq. On April 5, 2007, Issa met with Syrian president Bashar Assad to discuss Middle East issues, one day after Assad met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[73]
As of 2010[update], Issa served as a director of the American Task Force for Lebanon, a nonprofit organization working to advance Lebanon and its ties with the US.[74]
After the 2008 elections, Issa was appointed ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ahead of some more senior colleagues. Chairman Edolphus Towns clashed with Issa when Issa sought to investigate Countrywide Financial, which had granted Democratic U.S. Senators Chris Dodd and Kent Conrad loans with especially favorable terms. Republicans had filmed Democrats leaving the room after a canceled hearing on Countrywide; Towns then changed the locks to bar Republicans from the room.[citation needed] They clashed again when Issa sought a special prosecutor to consider whether the Obama administration had unlawfully offered a federal job to Joe Sestak as an inducement to refrain from running against Arlen Specter for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Towns and Issa did cooperate on some matters, improving transparency of some federal agency reports, and a Government Accountability Office examination of the Federal Reserve.[citation needed]
Following the 2010 elections, Issa became chairman. He has become a vocal advocate for investigations into the Obama administration, including the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, corruption in Afghanistan, WikiLeaks, and the Food and Drug Administration, among other issues.[75] In 2010 he told the press that he wanted the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to hold investigative hearings ""seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks.""[76]
In February 2011, the Watchdog Institute, an independent nonprofit reporting center based at San Diego State University, published an investigation alleging that as leader of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Issa built a team which included staff members with close connections to industries that could benefit from his investigations.[77]
On February 16, 2012, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on the Department of Health and Human Services's regulation requiring insurance plans to cover birth control, which Issa believes is a violation of the religious freedom of people who oppose the use of birth control. Sandra Fluke was submitted as a witness by Democratic members, but Issa did not permit her to testify, saying her name was submitted too late,[78] a claim which was challenged by Democrats.[79]
In May 2013, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform passed by voice vote a bill that was introduced by Issa, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 2061; 113th Congress).[57] H.R. 2061 aims to make information on federal expenditures more easily available, accessible, and transparent.[80] The bill was scheduled for a vote on the House floor on November 18, 2013.[81]
Issa introduced the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) on March 15, 2013. It is a proposed bill that would amend the Freedom of Information Act in order to make it easier and faster to request and receive information.[82][83] The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to create a single FOIA website for people to use to make FOIA requests and check on the status of their request.[82] The bill would also create a Chief FOIA Officers Council charged with reviewing compliance and recommending improvements.[82] This bill would also require the federal agency to release the information it disclosed to the person who requested it publicly afterwards.[83] Issa argued in favor of the bill because it ""shifts the burden of proof from the public requestor seeking information about a government agency...to the government being open and transparent unless it has a good reason to withhold.""[84] The bill passed unanimously in the United States House of Representatives on February 25, 2014.[85]
Issa introduced the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 1232; 113th Congress) on March 18, 2013. It is a proposed bill that would make changes and reforms to the current framework that manages how the federal government buys new technology.[86] One of the requirements would be that the government develop a streamlined plan for its acquisitions.[87] The bill would increase the power of existing Chief Information Officers (CIO) within federal agencies so that they could be more effective.[88] Each agency would also be reduced to having only one CIO in the agency, who is then responsible for the success and failure of all IT projects in that agency.[89] The bill would also require the federal government to make use of private sector best practices.[88] The bill is intended to reduce IT procurement related waste.[90] It passed the House in a voice vote on February 25, 2014.[87]
On May 7, 2014, Issa introduced a simple resolution in the House Recommending that the House of Representatives find Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The resolution holds Lois Lerner, one of the central Internal Revenue Service officials involved in the 2013 IRS scandal, in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify about the scandal before Issa's committee in response to a subpoena.[91][92]
In April 2008, the Daily News reported that Issa questioned federal expenditures made after 9/11. He was criticized for making comments that the federal government ""'just threw' buckets of cash at New York for an attack 'that had no dirty bomb in it, it had no chemical munitions in it'""[93] and asking ""why the firefighters who went there and everybody in the city of New York needs to come to the federal government for the dollars versus this being primarily a state consideration.""[93] In September 2009, Issa's office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to that statement ""would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero.""[94][95]
Issa came to national prominence in 2003 when he contributed over $1.6 million to help fund a signature-gathering drive for the petition to recall California Governor Gray Davis. At the time he made the contribution, it was widely believed that Issa intended to place himself on the ballot to replace Davis. However, following the entrance of fellow Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger into the race, two days before the filing deadline, Issa announced that he would not run.[96] Issa later said his mission had been accomplished with Davis' recall and that he wanted to continue to represent his district in Congress and work towards Middle East peace.[17] At one point in the campaign he suggested people [clarification needed] should vote against recalling Davis unless one of the two leading Republican contenders dropped out, concerned that Schwarzenegger and fellow Republican Tom McClintock would split votes, resulting in Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante being elected to succeed Davis.[97] Issa endorsed Schwarzenegger in the election."

Hunter","Republican","Military officer, businessman","Baptist - SBC","Duncan Duane Hunter (born December 7, 1976) is a member of the United States House of Representatives. He has served in Congress since 2009, previously representing California's 52nd congressional district, where he was preceded in office by his father, Duncan Lee Hunter. As a result of redistricting, Hunter switched to the neighboring 50th district at the start of the 113th Congress in 2013.
Hunter is a member of the Republican Party, and his district covers almost all of San Diego County except for the coastal and border areas. Hunter's district includes Fallbrook, San Marcos, Valley Center, Escondido, Santee, Lakeside, and mountain and desert areas stretching to the Imperial County line.
Hunter is a reserve United States Marine Corps officer and a veteran of both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. He was the first combat veteran of either Iraq or Afghanistan to serve in the U.S. Congress.[3] As of 2014, he was one of 17 veterans of the Iraq War serving in the U.S. House of Representatives.[4]


Hunter was born in San Diego, California,[5] the son of Helynn Louise ""Lynne"" (ne Layh) and Duncan Lee Hunter.[6][7] He graduated from Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. He attended San Diego State University, where he earned a degree in Business Administration. Hunter started a web design company in college to help pay for tuition. Upon graduation from San Diego State, he worked full-time in San Diego as an information technology business analyst.[8]
The day after the September 11 attacks, Hunter quit his job and joined the U.S. Marine Corps. He attended Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon graduation in March 2002, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He subsequently served as a field artillery officer in the 1st Marine Division after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and completed a second tour in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, serving in Battery A, 1st Battalion, 11th Marines. During his second tour, he participated in Operation Vigilant Resolve. In September 2005, Hunter was honorably discharged from active duty but remained in the Marine Corps Reserve. He then started a residential development company. In 2007, he was recalled to active duty and deployed to Afghanistan in support of the War in Afghanistan; this was his third tour of duty during the War on Terrorism. Hunter was honorably discharged from active duty in December 2007, but continues to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve.[9] Hunter was promoted to major in 2012.[2]
Hunter's awards include:[10]
Hunter ran for his father's seat and won the Republican primary with 72.2% of the vote in a four candidate field.[11][12] In the general election, Hunter defeated Democratic nominee Mike Lumpkin, an Iraq War veteran, 56.4%-39%.[13][14] Hunter thus replaced his father, Congressman Duncan L. Hunter (R-Calif.), who retired from Congress after fourteen terms.[15]
He won re-election to a second term with 63.1% of the vote, defeating Ray Lutz and Michael Benoit.[16]
After redistricting, Hunter decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 50th congressional district.[17] In the five-candidate open primary field, Hunter ranked first with 67.4% of the vote; Democratic nominee David Secor ranked second with 16.8% of the vote, qualifying for the November election.[18] In the general election, Hunter defeated Secor 67.7%-32.3%.[19]
In a 2009 interview with KPBS, Hunter expressed support for ""overriding"" the designation of smelt fish as an endangered species, saying that overriding it would reduce unemployment in California.[20] Hunter also opposed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, saying that it would ""take away"" the doctor-patient relationship and the right for people to choose ""what type of operations they have,"" and that it would allow a ""government bureaucrat"" to make health care decisions for people. In the KPBS interview, Hunter said, ""Things that you have problems with now would be exacerbated if you had government-run healthcare.""[21]
At an April 2010 Tea Party movement rally in Ramona, California, Hunter advocated for the deportation of United States citizens who are the children of illegal immigrants.[22] At the rally, Hunter said, ""It's a complex issue and...you could look and say, 'You're a mean guy. That's a mean thing to do. That's not a humanitarian thing to do.' "" Hunter added, ""We simply cannot afford what we're doing right now. We just can't afford it. California's going under."" Hunter confirmed the comments to San Diego County's North County Times, telling the newspaper that he also supported House Resolution 1868, a measure that called for the elimination of birthright citizenship in the United States. Hunter has also expressed support for the controversial 2010 Arizona immigration law, calling it a national security issue and ""a fantastic starting point.""[23]
In July 2010, Hunter introduced legislation into the 111th Congress to allow tobacco products to be shipped to service members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan;[24] the legislation died after being referred to committee.[25]
Hunter opposed the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and advocated for delaying the repeal after it was ratified by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, Hunter introduced legislation to require that all ""four military service chiefs certify that the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell won't negatively affect their combat units.""[26]
In 2011, Hunter voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.[27]
Columnist Dan Murtaugh of the Press-Register has suggested that Hunter's 2011 call to rebid the littoral combat ship program is an attempt to get federal funds for a shipyard in his district.[28] Hunter returned to the LCS program in 2012, with a call to reduce LCS builds in favor of amphibious ships, because he had read a report that the Marines had leased a ferry with similar characteristics to the LCS and JHSV.[29] In 2013 Hunter said the United States Navy was overworked and spread thin, and said that a ""306-ship target might represent the absolute minimum capacity the navy needs"".[30]
Hunter has called for the system of awarding the Medal of Honor to be evaluated, due to the cases of Sergeant Rafael Peralta and Captain William D. Swenson.[31][32][33] Even after Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel became the third Secretary to deny the award to Peralta, Hunter maintained his pressure on the Pentagon. In late March 2014, he sent a letter asking the Pentagon to reevaluate Peralta's case, as well as the case of Bradley Kasal, who used his body to shield a fellow Marine from a grenade blast in Iraq in 2004.[34]
In 2011, Hunter opposed a complete withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, citing the concern of an ""unreliable Afghan leadership,"" and called upon the Obama Administration to ""stop echoing a misshapen worldview that puts American interests last.""[35] In October 2012, Hunter returned from a visit to Afghanistan, as part of a congressional delegation, with a more upbeat assessment, stating ""Frankly I was very skeptical last year when I went last, and have been, on whether [the Afghans] can do this, but they are.""[36]
In 2013, Hunter accused the nation's military leaders of theatrics in the cuts that resulted from the failure of Congress to come to a deal to avert sequestration. He listed targeted spending reductions that he would prefer to make instead of the across the board cuts.[37] Hunter also voiced his concern regarding potentially different standards for women and men for the same direct combat positions, following the Obama Administration's decision to allow women to serve in those positions.[38]
On July 24, 2013, Hunter voted against the Amash amendment to rein in the domestic surveillance conducted by the NSA.[39]
In October 2013 Hunter was the only Representative from San Diego County to vote against the bill which ended the nation's 16-day partial government shutdown, explaining that he voted against it because it did not reduce spending or the national debt.[40]
On December 4, 2013, Hunter commented that if war with Iran becomes inevitable, which he ""sure as hell"" hoped wouldn't happen, the American response should be a ""massive aerial bombing campaign"" including ""tactical nuclear devices"".[41] He also said that the culture of Middle Easterners made them unreliable negotiating partners.[42]
Hunter has strongly criticized the Army's use of its internally developed DCGS-A system for tracking battlefield intelligence. He says that an alternative technology developed by Palantir Technologies is more effective at identifying IEDs and is preferred by Army personnel.[43] Hunter says that if Lt. Gen. Mary A. Legere is nominated to head the Defense Intelligence Agency, he will oppose her because of her support of the DCGS-A system.[44]
Hunter has moved to block a plan by the military to ban sales of tobacco products on bases and ships, indicating that he believes servicemembers should be able to make their own choices regarding use of tobacco.[45]
In 2013 Hunter called for the United States to train and arm Syrian rebels and stated his opinion that President Obama would be breaking the law if he bombed Syria without a Congressional mandate, and that it should be considered an impeachable offense.[46][47] In September 2014 Hunter voted against a proposal to train and arm Syrian rebels fighting against Islamic State extremists; he said the proposal didn't go far enough.[48]
Hunter introduced the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress) into the House on February 6, 2014.[49] The bill would amend laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC).[50] Hunter argued that the bill ""improves the effectiveness of Coast Guard missions by reducing inefficient operations and enhancing oversight, places the Coast Guard's major systems acquisition program on a sustainable track, and encourages job growth in the U.S. maritime industry by cutting regulatory burdens on job creation.""[51]
A provision in the bill would increase the amount of food aid that must be transported on private U.S.-flagged cargo ships to 75%. Supporters of the provision argue that it will support jobs in the maritime industry and enhance military readiness by ensuring a viable supply of cargo ships during wars and other emergencies. Opponents argue that it will increase the cost of food aid and delay delivery by months. They also argue that most private cargo ships are not ""militarily useful"".[52]
Hunter, his wife Margaret, and their three children have lived in Lakeside, California since 2007; he has previously lived in Oklahoma, Virginia and Idaho.[21][53]"

Vargas (born March 7, 1961) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for California's 51st congressional district since 2013. The district includes all of Imperial County as well as the southernmost portions of San Diego County.[1] He is a Democrat.
Vargas previously served in the California State Senate representing the 40th District, the California State Assembly representing the 79th district, and the San Diego City Council.


Juan Vargas was born on an egg ranch in National City, California, where he grew up very poor. He is the third of ten children of Tomas and Celina Vargas, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico in the late 1940s as part of the Bracero program.[2] Vargas graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BA from University of San Diego and earned an MA in Humanities from Fordham University in New York.
After college, Vargas joined the Jesuit Novitiate (introduction) in Santa Barbara. In the Jesuits, Vargas served in an orphanage in the civil-war-torn jungles of El Salvador. After leaving the Jesuits, he decided on law school and graduated in 1991 with a JD from Harvard Law School,[3] making him a classmate of President Barack Obama.
In 1992, he decided to run for the newly created 50th Congressional District, which was based in San Diego. He lost the Democratic primary, ranking fourth with 19% of the vote. Bob Filner won the primary with a plurality of just 26%[4] and went on to win the election.
Vargas served on the San Diego City Council from 19932000. While on the Council, he created ""Operation Restore"" to employ homeless individuals to remove graffiti and to rehabilitate homes.[5]
In 1996, Vargas decided to challenge Filner in the Democratic primary. Vargas wouldnt debate Filner, so the incumbent instead sparred with a life-sized Vargas cardboard cutout. Vargas said he agrees with Filner on 99 percent of issues.[6] Filner defeated him 55%-45%.[7]
In 2000, Vargas decided to run for California's 79th State Assembly district. He defeated Republican Jon Parungao 77%-19%.[8][9] In 2002, he defeated Republican Mark Fast 66%-30%.[10] In 2004, he defeated Libertarian Eli Wallace Conroe 85%-15%.[11]
In his first year in the Assembly, he was appointed Assistant Majority Leader. He authored AB 188, which was legislation that bans smoking in children's playgrounds. He also introduced legislation aimed at protecting children from arcade video games. Vargas also authored legislation to mandate life sentences for people who commit violent sex crimes against children, which served as a model for Chelseas Law.[12]
In 2006 Vargas decided to challenge Filner for a third time, this time in California's 51st congressional district. Vargas accused Filner of being a part of the culture of corruption of Washington, pointing out that Filner had paid his wife more than $500,000 in campaign funds for consulting services performed from their condominium in Washington. Filner in return argued that Vargas had controversial payments to his brother-in-law, who was a lobbyist for realtors.[15][16] Filner defeated Vargas 51%-43%, with Danny Ramirez getting 6% of the vote.[17][18][9]
After leaving the State Assembly in 2006 due to term limits, Vargas took a job with a home, auto and small business insurance company and was tasked with creating jobs and outreach in diverse San Diego Communities as part of the company's diversity initiative.[citation needed] Vargas left his job at the end of 2009 to return to public service as a Democratic candidate for the California State Senate.
In 2010 Vargas narrowly won a seat in the California State Senate, 40th District. He defeated Assemblywoman Mary Salas by 22 votes, after recounts in San Diego and Riverside counties. He resigned from the Senate effective January 2, 2013 so that he could take his seat as a Congressman. A special election to fill his seat was held in March 2013.[19]
In 2012 when Filner announced he would retire from Congress to run for Mayor of San Diego, Vargas endorsed him despite their history of bitter rivalry.[22] Vargas then ran for Filner's seat in the 51st district. In the open primary, he ranked first with 46% of the vote. Republican Michael Crimmins ranked second with 20%, Democrat State Senator Denise Moreno Ducheny came in third with 15%, and four other candidates received single digit percentages.[23] In November, he defeated Crimmins 71%-29%.[24][25]
He was sworn in on January 3, 2013.
He and his wife Adrienne live in the Golden Hill area of San Diego and have two daughters. During the 1999 armed conflict in Kosovo, Vargas welcomed a Kosovar refugee family into his family's home for nearly two years.[3]"

Peters (born June 17, 1958) is an American politician who has been the United States Representative for California's 52nd congressional district since 2013.[2] He is a Democrat. The district includes coastal and central portions of the city of San Diego, as well as the suburbs of Poway and Coronado.[3]
Peters previously served two terms on the San Diego City Council from 2000 to 2008, and he was the first person to hold the post of President of the City Council (20062008). He also served as a Commissioner for the Unified Port of San Diego before becoming a member of Congress.


Peters was born in Springfield, Ohio in 1958. He was raised in Michigan. His father was a Lutheran minister and his mother was a homemaker.[4][5][6] In an interview, Peters said that he took out student loans and participated in his school's work-study program, through which he was given jobs answering phones and cleaning pigeon cages.[4] He received his undergraduate degree from Duke University.[7]
He served as an economist on the staff of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),[8] then earned a law degree from the New York University School of Law.[7] Peters served as a deputy city attorney in San Diego from 1991 to 1996.[6] Prior to his election to the City Council, Peters worked as an attorney in private practice and practiced environmental law. He gained notability in a lawsuit against a local shipbuilder.[9]
In 2002, Peters was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[10] He served one three-year term on the Commission. A coalition of environmental groups gave his votes an environmental score of 31% in 2002, 52% in 2003 and 40% in 2004.[11][12] He was ""involuntarily retired"" in 2005 when new State Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez did not renew his appointment.[13]
In 2000, he ran for the San Diego City Council's 1st district. In the open primary, he ranked second with 24% of the vote, qualifying for the November general election. Businesswoman Linda Davis ranked first with 32% of the vote.[14] In the November election, Peters defeated Davis 53%-47%.[15]
In the 2004 open primary, he came in first with 48% of the vote. Businessman Phil Thalheimer ranked second with 31% of the vote.[16][17] In the November election, Peters won re-election to a second term, defeating Thalheimer 55%-45%.[18]
In 2004, San Diego city residents voted to change the structure of city government from a council-city manager form of government to a mayor-council form of government, which made the mayor the city's chief executive officer.[19] Serving as a member of the city council during this time, Peters was elected to chair the transition committee in charge of this project.[20]
In 2005, Peters was elected by his fellow council members to serve as the first President of the San Diego City Council,[21] which under the new form of government made him the chief officer of the city's newly defined legislative branch. In 2008, San Diego's mayor vetoed a 24% pay raise for the city council which Peters and four other members of the council had voted for themselves.[22][23]
Peters was a member of the San Diego City Council during the San Diego pension scandal.[24] In 2002, he voted with the majority to underfund the employee pension system.[25][26] The ensuing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared Peters and the other council members of fraud, but the Kroll Report investigation called them ""negligent."" The city spent $7 million defending officials involved in this case, including $631,000 defending Peters.[27][28] During the 2012 congressional election campaign, his Republican opponent, Brian Bilbray, made the scandal a major theme against Peters.[29]
Peters cited a reduction in sewer spills and beach closure days as accomplishments during his city council tenure. He stated that the city averaged one spill per day when he was elected in 2000, but that, during his terms in office, the incidence of such spills fell by 80%.[30] He was involved in the push to ban alcohol from the city's beaches, as well as to ban smoking from public beaches and parks.[31][32]
Having reached the end of his eight-year term limit on the city council, Peters ran for San Diego City Attorney in 2008, challenging incumbent City Attorney Mike Aguirre. In the open primary, state legislator Jan Goldsmith ranked first with 32% of the vote. The incumbent ranked second with 29% of the vote, qualifying for the runoff election. Peters ranked third with 20% of the vote and did not advance to the November runoff.[33] He later served as deputy county counsel for the County of San Diego.[34]
In 2008, Peters was criticized by the Voice of San Diego for excessive water use. Citizens were urged to curb their water use due to a drought. Peters was revealed as a heavy water user and said he would try to conserve but ended the year having consumed more than 1 million gallons of water for his home, which sits on a 34,848-square-foot lot near Mount Soledad, and for an adjacent landscaped parcel.[35]
Peters was a port commissioner from 2009 through 2012, serving as chair of the Port Commission in 2011. He was sworn in as a commissioner in January 2009, after having been appointed by the San Diego City Council.[36][37] He represented the City of San Diego on the Port Commission, making decisions regarding the uses of San Diego Bay and its adjacent waterfront land.[38]
Peters was chosen by his fellow commissioners to serve as chair of the board of commissioners for 2011.[39] In January 2011, he said one of his top priorities was to have the South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista decommissioned to make room for better use.[39] In the year Peters served as chair, the board of commissioners reached a deal with the former operator of the plant for its demolition.[40] The Port also conducted community outreach over a period of six months to gather ideas for improving San Diegos waterfront front porch between the airport and Seaport Village.[41]
Peters ran for the newly redrawn California's 52nd congressional district in 2012. Incumbent Republican Representative Brian Bilbray of the 50th district was drawn into the 52nd district due to redistricting. Eleven candidates filed to run. In the open primary, Bilbray ranked first with 41% of the vote. Peters ranked second with 23% of the vote, qualifying for the November general election ballot. He narrowly edged out State Assemblywoman Lori Saldaa, a fellow Democrat, who earned 22% of the vote. The other candidates all received single-digit percentages.[42] During the primary, Peters received the endorsement of the retiring incumbent Representative, Bob Filner.[43] On election night the vote was too close to call, but Peters' small lead increased each day as more absentee, vote-by-mail, and provisional ballots were processed. On November 16, Bilbray conceded the race to Peters.[44] Peters officially defeated Bilbray 51%-49%, a difference of 6,956 votes.[45]
In the June 2014 primary, Peters was opposed by three Republicans. Peters was the top vote getter in the primary with 42%. Under California's ""top two"" primary system, he faced the second place finisher, former city councilman Carl DeMaio, in the November general election.[46] After a hotly contested campaign the vote was too close to call on election night, but Peters pulled ahead as additional ballots were counted, and DeMaio conceded three days after the election.
Peters is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline Program. The program is designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic candidates.[47] In August, Peters was endorsed for re-election by the United States Chamber of Commerce, a relatively rare action by the Chamber of Commerce, which usually endorses Republicans.[48][49]
In a poll conducted by SurveyUSA for U-T San Diego and 10News during September 11-15, 2014, DeMaio and Peters were in a virtual dead heat with Peters polling at 47% and DeMaio at 46%.[50] The same poll taken October 2-6 was again described as a dead heat, with DeMaio showing a 3-point lead over Peters - within the margin of error.[51] An earlier Survey USA poll showed Peters leading by one point.[51]
On election night the result was too close to call, with DeMaio ahead by 751 votes. Over the next few days Peters pulled into the lead. By Friday Peters had a lead of 4,491 votes and the Associated Press said he had won.[52] The final result was Peters 51.59% and DeMaio 48.41%.[53]
Documents released after the election stated that the initial accuser of DeMaio met with Peters' campaign manager before going public with his accusation of sexual harassment, that he gave her some internal DeMaio campaign documents, and that the Peters campaign copied some of the documents before turning them over to police.[54][55] Peters' campaign received the documents on 5 June, and turned it over to police on 9 June; Peters later said his campaign ""immediately turned over to the police.""[56]
In April 2013, Peters voted for the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, a bill that would allow federal intelligence agencies to share cybersecurity intelligence and information with private entities and utilities.[57]
In May 2013, Peters voted against repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).[58][59] In October 2013, Peters was one of nine Democratic co-sponsors of HR3425, an unsuccessful proposal which would have delayed any penalties under the PPACA until four months after the program's website is fully functional.[60]
As of October 2013, Peters had voted the same way as Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner on 9 out of the 16 times that Boehner has chosen to cast a vote.[61] The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Peters voted with the Chamber position on key bills 69% of the time.[48]
Peters says he would prefer that Congress develop a strategy to deal with climate change, but that in lieu of congressional action, he would support President Obama's moves toward bypassing Congress and looking for an international climate change deal.[62]
Peters is a member of the House Democratic Caucus and the New Democrat Coalition.[63] He is also a member of the No Labels Caucus.[64][65]
Peters lives with his family in La Jolla.[8] He and his wife, Lynn E. Gorguze, have a daughter and a son. Lynn is president and CEO of Cameron Holdings,[66] and his family has a net worth of $112 million.[67] As of 2014 Peters is the sixth wealthiest member of Congress.[67]
Peters' campaign website reports that he has been affiliated with the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, CleanTECH San Diego, and the UCSD Chancellors Community Advisory Board.[8]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is based in Denver.


A fourth-generation Coloradan, DeGette was born in Tachikawa, Japan, the daughter of Patricia Anne (ne Rose) and Richard Louis DeGette.[1] Her parents were American, and, at the time of her birth, her father was serving in the armed forces. She graduated from Colorado College where she earned a B.A. in political science, and was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society in 1979.[2] She earned a Juris Doctor degree from New York University in 1982. She then returned to Denver and began a law practice focusing on civil rights and employment litigation.
Long active in Denver politics, she was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1992. She was reelected in 1994 and chosen as assistant minority leader. She authored a law that guarantees Colorado women unobstructed access to abortion clinics and other medical care facilities, also known as the ""Bubble Bill"". The United States Supreme Court found DeGette's ""Bubble Bill"" constitutional in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000). She also authored the state Voluntary Cleanup and Redevelopment Act, a model for similar cleanup programs.
DeGette serves as the co-chair of both the Congressional Diabetes Caucus and Pro-Choice Caucus, and is Vice Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus. With the Democrats' victory in the 2006 midterm elections, DeGette briefly considered running for House Majority Whip, but bowed out in favor of Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.
DeGette received national attention in 2005, when the House of Representatives passed legislation she cosponsored to lift President George W. Bush's limits on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. DeGette, who had been working on the measure since 2001, enlisted the support of Representative Michael N. Castle (Republican from Delaware), who became DeGette's principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation. The DeGette-Castle bill passed the Senate on July 18, 2006. President Bush vetoed the bill the next day  his first veto.
In 2007, DeGette served as the House Democrats' designated whip on the bill reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (HR 3162). Although President Bush announced his opposition to the legislation, the House passed the bill on August 1, 2007, by a vote of 225 to 204. The Senate adopted a different version of the legislation the next day.
DeGette was also a cosponsor for the Udall Amendment to the House Energy Bill, which the House approved by a vote of 220 to 190 on August 4, 2007. The Amendment creates a national Renewable Energy Standard that requires electric suppliers to produce 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources, 4 percent of which can come from efficiency, by the year 2020.
On September 12, 2007, DeGette announced that she would introduce the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 in Congress. The bill was unsuccessful and did not pass the committee level.[3] She reintroduced the bill in 2009.
She is a cosponsor of legislation to provide the District of Columbia voting representation.[4]
On January 24, 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Representative DeGette to the House Page Board.
On November 26, 2007, DeGette announced her endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for president, and was named national co-chair of Clinton's Health Care Policy Task Force and adviser on stem-cell research.[5] DeGette was a superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August 2008.
DeGette was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions (except in the case of rape, incest, or life of the mother) in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.
DeGette is pro-choice and the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus. DeGette and her fellow co-chair, Louise Slaughter, are the sponsors of the Prevention First Act.[6] This act aims to decrease the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases through better womens healthcare. The NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC endorsed DeGette and gave her a 100% approval rating based on her positions.[7][8] DeGette also received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood.[8] The National Right to Life Committee gave her a 0% rating due to her strong pro-choice stance.[8]
DeGette has consistently voted in favor of the use of embryonic stem cell research.[9] DeGette says we must pass common-sense embryonic stem cell research legislation, placing these regulations into statute and once and for all, ensuring this critical life-saving research can be conducted for years to come, unimpeded by political whims or naysayers. [10] DeGette and Charlie Dent introduced the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Act of 2011, which would provide lasting support for stem cell research.[11]
DeGette supports bans on semi-automatic firearms like those used in the 2012 Aurora shooting which happened in a movie theatre near her district. DeGette believes that the sole purpose of these guns and these magazines is to kill people.[12] DeGette and Carolyn McCarthy introduced the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2012.[13] The Brady Campaign endorsed DeGette's reelection in 2008, 2010, and 2012.
According to a Denver Post Journalist, during a public hearing in Denver, April 2, 2013, DeGette did not appear to understand that a magazine can be reloaded with more ammunition. Instead she stated that it was ""ammunition"" and will get used up.[14] Gun magazines are designed to be reused hundreds of times.[14]
Longtime First District Congresswoman Pat Schroeder chose not to run for a 13th term in 1996, which prompted DeGette to run. Her principal opponent in the 1996 primary election was former City Council member Tim Sandos, whom Denver Mayor Wellington Webb endorsed shortly before the primary. DeGette won the primary with 55 percent of the vote, all but assuring her of election in the heavily Democratic district (the 1st District has been in Democratic hands for all but six years since 1933). Schroeder, who stayed neutral during the primary, endorsed DeGette once DeGette became the Democratic nominee. DeGette won with 57 percent and has been reelected seven times since.
DeGette won against Green Party nominee Tom Kelly.
DeGette won against Republican nominee George Lilly, Libertarian nominee Martin Buchanan, and Independent Gary Swing.
DeGette won reelection against Republican nominee Mike Fallon, Green nominee Gary Swing, American Constitutional Party nominee Chris Styskal, and Libertarian nominee Clint Jones.
DeGette won reelection against Republican nominee Danny Stroud, Libertarian nominee Frank Atwood and Green Party nominee Gary Swing. DeGette won with 68.23% of the votes.
DeGette is married to Lino Lipinsky, a partner in the law firm of McKenna Long & Aldridge, and she has two daughters."

A Democrat, Polis is the member of the United States House of Representatives for Colorado's 2nd congressional district, serving since 2009. He is a former member of the Colorado State Board of Education. Polis is the first openly gay parent in Congress.[4]


Polis is the son of Stephen Schutz and Susan Polis Schutz. He attended La Jolla Country Day School in San Diego, California and later received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Princeton University.
Polis co-founded American Information Systems (AIS), Inc while still in college. AIS was an internet access provider and was sold in 1998. In 1996, he co-founded[5] a free electronic greeting card website, Bluemountain.com, which was sold to Excite@Home in 1999 for $430 million in stock and $350 million in cash.[6][7]
In February 1998, Polis founded ProFlowers, an online florist, in La Jolla, California. In December of that year, economist Dr. Arthur Laffer began advising Polis and joined ProFlowers as a Director.[8] ProFlowers, later renamed Provide Commerce, Inc., went public on NASDAQ as PRVD on December 17, 2003. In 2005, Provide Commerce was acquired by media conglomerate Liberty Media Corporation for $477 million.
In 2000, Polis founded the Jared Polis Foundation, whose mission is to ""create opportunities for success by supporting educators, increasing access to technology, and strengthening our community.""[9] Its main programs are the annual ""Teacher Recognition Awards"";[10] the ""Community Computer Connection"" program,[11] which refurbishes and donates more than 3,500 computers a year to schools and non-profit organizations; and the semi-annual ""Jared Polis Foundation Education Report"". Polis has also founded two charter schools, one with multiple campuses across three states and a post-secondary school, the New America College, for at-risk students. In 2004, he established the charter school ""New America School"", which is a high school that primarily serves older immigrant youth ages 1621 and has three campuses in Colorado, in the Denver Metro area, two campuses in New Mexico[12] and a campus opening in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2013.[13] In 2005, Polis co-founded with Urban Peak the charter school Academy of Urban Learning[14] in Denver to help youth at risk of becoming homeless or living in unstable living conditions.
Polis was named Outstanding Philanthropist for the 2006 National Philanthropy Day in Colorado. He is a recipient of many awards, including the Boulder Daily Cameras 2007 Pacesetter Award in Education;[15] the Kauffman Foundation Community Award;[16] the Denver consul general of Mexico Ohtli;[17] the Martin Luther King, Jr. Colorado Humanitarian Award; and the Anti-Defamation Leagues inaugural Boulder Community Builder Award.
At the time of his election, Polis had founded a number of companies and is one of the 10 richest members of the United States Congress, estimated to be worth at least $65.91 million.[18]
In 2000, Polis was elected at-large as a member of the Colorado State Board of Education, and served for a single six-year term until January 2007 when the district was eliminated.[19] His election was one of the closest in Colorado history, as he defeated incumbent Ben Alexander by 90 votes out of 1.6 million cast.[20] Polis served as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education during his term.[21][22][23]
In 2006, Polis served as Co-chair of ""Coloradans for Clean Government"", a committee that supported Amendment 41, a citizen-initiated ballot measure to ban gifts by registered lobbyists to government officials, establish a $50 annual restriction on gift-giving from non-lobbyists, establish a two-year cooling-off period before former state legislators and statewide elected officials can begin lobbying, and create an independent ethics commission. In November 2006, 62.3% of Colorado voters approved the ""Ethics in Government"" constitutional amendment.[24]
In 2007, Polis Co-chaired the ""Building for our Future"" campaign that supported ballot question 3A in the Boulder Valley School District to issue $296.8 million in bonds for the improvement and modernization of aging school facilities the largest capital construction bond issue in the districts history and the largest school bond proposal in Colorado that year. In November 2006, 58% of Boulder Valley School District voters approved the measure.[25]
In 2014, Polis planned to champion two ballot measures which would have limited fracking in Colorado by banning drilling near schools and homes and by empowering communities to pass their own rules. However, he dropped the divisive measures after reaching a deal with Governor John Hickenlooper, which will create a task force. The absence of the initiatives is seen as a relief to vulnerable democrats who would have had to take controversial stances on the issue.[26]
In 2008, Polis won a heavily-contested Democratic primary election, and went on to win the general election on November 4, 2008, winning 62% of the vote to succeed Mark Udall.
In 2010, Polis won 57% of the popular vote to win re-election.[27][28]
In 2012, Polis ran uncontested in the Democratic primary, and won a third election to Congress with 55% of popular vote.[29]
Polis is currently the Red to Blue program chair for the DCCC, helping recruit and raise money for Democratic candidates in competitive congressional districts.[30] According to sources close to Polis, he has eyed a higher leadership role in the DCCC, running for Vice-Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, after then-chairman Xavier Becerra was term limited.[31] The position ended up going to New York Congressman Joe Crowley.[32]
For the 2013-14 session of Congress, Polis will serve on following committees
The following is an incomplete list of legislation that Polis introduced:
In 2011 Polis, along with Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT), introduced the 2011 Race to the Top Act (H.R. 1532). The legislation authorized old provisions and some new ones including; new standards on encouraging and rewarding states based on implementing comprehensive reforms in innovation through 4-year competitive grants, allowing more funding and expanding Charter schools, and compensating teachers in part based on their students performance.[34][35][36]
Polis has sponsored other education bills and legislation regarding students including;
Polis has also introduced the Computer Science Education Act, which helps prepare job training for computing jobs, and the ACE Act, which would provide funding to improve outcomes for students in persistently low-performing schools, and to authorize school turnaround grants.[44][45]
Polis opposed the Iraq War saying that, The invasion of Iraq was a colossal mistake, and I opposed the war from the very beginning. Bush's blunders and the Democrats who gave him cover along the way have left us without easy solutions for improving the situation.[46] During a congressional trip to Iraq Polis has praised the Sons of Iraq policy, which funds former military and police officials under Saddam Hussein, to lay down their arms against coalition forces, patrol neighborhoods, and to fight against other Sunni insurgents. Saying in an op-ed that, If we had started this policy sooner after the invasion, we no doubt could have prevented loss of life. As can be expected, some of them turn out to be corrupt and attack us anyway but most seem to be helping to keep the order. The challenge is to bring them into the fold of the new Iraqi government and a proper chain of command structure.[47]
In the op-ed Polis also said, The hippie in me bemoans the fact that we defeated the Iraqi military only to help them build an even stronger one that might one day be used against children and innocents, as often is the case. When will all the killing end? Where have all the flowers gone? And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and they shall study war no more.[48]
Polis supports removing all troops from Afghanistan.[49] In 2010 Polis supported a failed resolution to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan within 30 days, saying that I don't believe that this ongoing occupation is in our national interest, and that, I supported the initial action to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that succeeded, The challenge we face now is a stateless menace.[50]
Polis also took a Congressional Delegation trip to Afghanistan, meeting with the former Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar, US military officials and Diplomats. During his meeting with Mohammed Hanif Atmar, Polis focused on the Education gap between Afghanistan and Western nations, the low literacy rate for Afghan police and military officials, and combating Political corruption.[51] Polis has criticized expanding US troops in Afghanistan, and supports putting resources in intelligence and special operations. Writing in a report after visiting Afghanistan that We need all the high-level diplomatic support we can to master the diplomatic complexities of fighting against an enemy holed up in two countries, as well as navigating the complex regional politics. Also adding that, Our best estimates show there to be no more than 5,000 al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They operate out of areas in southern and eastern Afghanistan and on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. Do we really need to occupy an entire country of around 30 million people to root out 5,000 enemies? I harbor a deep degree of ambivalence about the military surge. The diplomatic surge is good, increasing our covert ops and intelligence abilities focused on al-Qaeda is good, but adding tens of thousands of American troops for years doesn't necessarily get us closer to defeating al-Qaeda.[52]
Polis voted in favor of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act expanding economic sanctions against Iran under the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, and co-sponsored H.R. 1327; the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2009, authorizing state and local governments to direct divestiture from, and prevent investment in, companies with investments of $20,000,000 or more in Iran's energy sector.[53] [54]
Polis, along with Representatives Barney Frank and Tammy Baldwin, has called on the United States embassy in Iraq and former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to prioritize investigating the allegations of rape, torture and executions of LGBT Iraqis, saying Such disturbing violations of human rights should not be ignored and the United States should not stand idly by while billions of taxpayer dollars are used to support their government.
Along with the support of 35 members of the House, Polis has also called on the State Department to address violence against the LGBT community in Honduras. [55]
While in the House, Polis has been a staunch advocate for civil liberties, saying while campaigning in 2008 that balance must be restored between the executive and the judicial branch [through the restoration of Habeas corpus], (clarifying that the President does not have the Constitutional authority to alter legislation through signing statements), and between the executive and the people of the United between the executive and the legislative branch States (clarifying that the Fourth Amendment requires probable cause and a warrant for the government to monitor Americans).[56]
Polis has been a vocal opponent of the PATRIOT ACT. In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, Polis stated, Mr. Speaker, the Patriot Act is a bill that has been plagued with abuse since it was first passed, and todays rule is yet another example of short-circuiting the system that our Founding Fathers set up. If there were ever the need for the close supervision and congressional oversight of a law, it is a law that discusses how and under what conditions a government can spy on its own citizens.[57] On February 2011 Polis voted against H.R. 514, extending expiring provisions of the Patriot Act, authorizing court-approved roving wiretaps that permit surveillance on multiple phones, allowing court-approved seizure of records and property in anti-terrorism operations, and permitting surveillance against a so-called lone wolf, a non-US citizen engaged in terrorism who may not be part of a recognized terrorist group.[58] [59]
Polis supports an open and free internet, and has been critical of SOPA, PIPA and CISPA, saying in an interview with Forbes that; I oppose piracy and want to see intellectual property protected because that is what fosters and rewards innovation. But SOPA wont accomplish a meaningful reduction in piracy and causes massive collateral damage to the Internet ecosystem.[60] While debating SOPA on the house floor Polis said that SOPA and PIPA directly threaten the very internet that has brought humanity great prosperity and greater peace, and that, Allowing the military and NSA to spy on Americans on American soil goes against every principle this country was founded on. [61][62] Polis, along with 167 other members of the house, voted against CISPA.[63]
Polis, along with representatives Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and Darrell Issa (R-CA), sponsored Aaron's Law,[64] in the wake of the suicide of computer programmer and internet activist Aaron Swartz, (the co-founder of Reddit), who was facing computer and wire fraud charges and more than 30 years in prison and fines of over $1,000,000 for violating the terms of service for illegally downloading academic journal articles from the digital library JSTOR.[65] The proposed bill would exclude terms of service violations from the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute.[66][67] Polis said that the charges brought on by US Attorney Carmen Ortiz were ""ridiculous and trumped-up,"" and that ""It's absurd that he was made a scapegoat. I would hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else.""[68]
Polis voted against the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, and is against Section 1021, which has drawn controversy about implications to detention policy.[69] After the law was signed, Polis, along with other members of the house, introduced legislation to repeal the indefinite detention provision. Though legislation has failed to pass the house, Section 1021 is now pending in the courts.[70]
Polis has been an early critic of the War on Drugs, stating that ""Just as the policy of prohibition failed nationally with alcohol - it's now up to states and counties - I think we should do the same with marijuana.""[71] During a June 2012 testimony of DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, Polis questioned whether marijuana should be classified as a schedule one drug.[72] Polis questioned Leonhart, who refused to answer whether or not cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin posed a greater risk to someone's health than marijuana.[73] Polis also advocated the legalization of medical marijuana to combat prescription drug abuse.[74]
Polis is the leading sponsor of H.R. 499, or, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013.[75] If passed, the act would: Decriminalize possession of cannabis at the federal level; Relinquish the Drug Enforcement Administration's regulation of cannibus under the Controlled Substances Act, transferring its federal regulation from the DEA to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (renaming the ATF the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana, Firearms and Explosives); and would authorize the Food and Drug Administration to apply the equivalent regulatory powers it has over alcohol, to cannabis.[76] The act currently has 16 cosponsors - Fifteen Democrats and One Republican - in the House.[77]
Polis is currently one of seven openly gay members of the 113th Congress, and caucuses in the LGBT Equality Caucus. Polis has pushed for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, and has praised the Obama Administrations decision for the Justice Department to no longer defend DOMA, saying that Section 3 of the law is unconstitutional.[78] In a statement Polis said I applaud the Administration for finally recognizing what my colleagues and I have long criticized, to deny people the ability to officially acknowledge their relationship and feel welcomed as partners only for being LGBT is absurd and todays decision confirms this.[79] Polis has also credited President Obama for openly endorsing Gay Marriage calling it Welcome news to American families.[80] Polis is an original cosponsor of H.R. 116, or the Respect for Marriage Act. H.R. 116 repeals DOMA allowing Marriage recognition for Gay and Lesbian couples in the US, the District of Columbia, and US territories.[81]
Polis is the leading sponsor of the Student Non-Discrimination Act with Senator Al Franken (D-MN), who introduced the act in the Senate. SNDA would establish a comprehensive federal non-discrimination prohibition in all public and elementary and secondary schools based on sexual orientation and gender identity, expanding Title IX of the Education Amendments Act to LGBT students.[82] In a statement, Polis said education is the right of every student regardless of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. ""The alarming increase in teen suicides has shown us just how far we are from making our childrens schools safe spaces.[83] The SNDA has 167 co-sponsors in the house, with only two Republicans signing on.[84] SNDA is also supported by the ACLU and Change.org.[85]
Polis voted for the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell, which prohibited openly Gay and Lesbian members of the Military from serving.[86] Along with 67 members of the House, in a letter to President Obama, Polis urged for the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell. In the letter it cited a California District Judges ruling of the unconstitutionality of DADT, and the 14,000 service members that have been discharged from the Military since the passage of DADT.[87] In a press release on the repeal of DADT Polis said: The repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell is a victory for the cause of equality and our national defense. For too long, this wrongheaded policy prevented brave Americans from serving in our military and defending our country just because of who they love. It undermined our national security by forcing gays and lesbians out of the military service at a time when America needs the most talented and the bravest protecting us, regardless of their orientation.[88]
Polis is also a supporter and cosponsor of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, giving adequate funding and ability to federal authorities to investigate hate crimes, and has advocated for protections against LGBT victims of domestic abuse to be included in the Violence Against Women Act.[89][90]
On the morning of September 18, 2014, Congress Member Polis filed a discharge motion to bring the LGBT Employment Non-Discrimination Act to the floor of the House of Representatives for a proper vote. House Representatives Garamenedi, Holt, and Connolly joined Jared in support in filing the petition. The revised legislation includes narrow religious exemptions. [91]
Polis vowed to protect Bitcoin in Congress and to fight against any attempts by the government to enact policies that restrict the growth of bitcoin and its burgeoning startup community.[92] In May 2014, Jared Polis became the first U.S. representative to accept campaign donations via Bitcoin.[93]
In 2014, Polis sponsored two ballot measures targeting hydraulic fracturing, Initiatives 88 and 89. Polis sought to move fracking from 500 feet from people's homes to 2,000 feet to improve the quality of life for homeowners in affected areas.From Time.com On 4 August 2014, Polis announced that he would withdraw his support for the two ballot measures.[94]
Polis is one of the few openly gay people elected to the House as a freshman[95] and the first gay parent in Congress.[1][2][96][97][98][99][100] Polis and his partner, Marlon Reis, have two children: son Caspian Julius, born on September 30, 2011, and daughter Cora Barucha, born July 4, 2014.
Polis enjoys computer games such as League of Legends.[101] He is a member of the Jewish faith[3] and resides in Boulder, Colorado."

Tipton (born November 9, 1956) is the U.S. Representative for Colorado's 3rd congressional district. In November 2010, he defeated three-term, Democratic incumbent John Salazar, whom he lost to by a wide margin, in 2006. He is a member of the Republican Party. He was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives and a co-owner of a pottery company in Cortez, Colorado. Prior to being elected to public office, he was chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, from 1997 to 2008.


Tipton was raised in Cortez, where he attended public schools with his brother Joe and graduated from Montezuma-Cortez High School. He went on to Ft. Lewis College in Durango where he studied political science and graduated in 1978. After Ft. Lewis, he returned to Cortez and founded Mesa Verde Indian Pottery, which he co-owns with his brother, Joe.[citation needed]
A lifelong Republican, he became involved in the unsuccessful Reagan presidential campaign of 1976 and was a delegate to the Republican Convention that year. He also assisted with local campaigns for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 across Montezuma County, Colorado and the 3rd Congressional district.
He held various roles for the campaigns of Scott McInnis, Ben Campbell, Bill Owens and George W. Bush. A former Montezuma County Republican chairman, he was also the party chairman of the 3rd Congressional District for eight years.[citation needed]
On February 5, 2008, he announced his candidacy for the Colorado House seat representing District 58. The announcement came shortly after the incumbent, Ray Rose, announced he would retire in 2008. He had no opposition in the Republican primary,[1] but faced Democratic candidate Noelle Hagan in the November 2008 general election. Hagan's candidacy was endorsed by the Denver Post[2] and the Montrose Daily Press, [3] but Tipton won the with 59 percent of the vote.[4]
With Representatives Laura Bradford and Frank McNulty, Tipton planned on re-introducing a version of Jessica's Law to establish minimum sentences for child sex offenders,[5] sponsoring bills to create a full-time judge position in Montrose[6][7] and to simplify water rights filing.[8] The attempt to introduce a version of Jessica's Law was unsuccessful, it dying in committee.[8]
For the 2009 legislative session, Tipton was named to seats on the House Agriculture, Livestock, and Natural Resources Committee and the House Local Government Committee.[9]
He unsuccessfully challenged the then, first term, Democratic U.S. congressman, John Salazar. Tipton lost 38% to 62% for Salazar.[10]
He again challenged Democratic incumbent John Salazar in Colorado's 3rd congressional district. Libertarian Gregory Gilman and independent Jake Segrest were also on the ballot, with independents John W. Hargis, Sr. and James Fritz qualified as write-in candidates. He decided to retire from the Colorado House of Representatives to run for Congress in 2010, again challenging Salazar.[11] In the Republican primary, he defeated Bob McConnell 56% to 44%.[12] In the general election, he defeated Salazar 50.10% to 45.76%.
In 2012, he was challenged by Sal Pace, a Democratic state representative from Pueblo. His re-election campaign was aided by $1.3 million in advertising against Pace, funded by the Grover Norquist led, Americans for Tax Reform.[13] SG Interests, an oil and gas company from Texas, that sought to drill in the Thompson Divide area, also campaigned against Pace.[14]
He has signed Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[15] He has also supported the Ryan Plan, having twice voted for it.[16]
In 2010 Tipton signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[17]
Tipton introduced the Water Rights Protection Act (H.R. 3189; 113th Congress) into the House on September 26, 2013. The bill would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands.[18] Tipton said the bill was needed because it ""provides critical protection for water rights' holders from federal takings by ensuring that federal government agencies cannot extort private property rights through uneven-handed negotiations.""[19] Tipton argued that the bill ""prohibits federal agencies from pilfering water rights through the use of permits, leases, and other land management arrangements, for which it would otherwise have to pay just compensation under the 5th Amendment of the Constitution.""[19]
In 2011, it was reported that he spent over $7,000 on vendors that did business with his nephew's company.[20] Also in 2011, Tipton wrote an apology letter to the House Ethics Committee after it became known that his daughter was using his name in an effort to secure government contracts from other Congressional offices. In 2012, he violated House rules when his office mistakenly used taxpayer resources to promote a campaign event.[21]
A super PAC, funded by oil and gas driller SG Interests, is registered at the address of Tiptons campaign attorney and run by a law clerk in his office. Although it is a violation of election laws for super PACs and a candidate's campaign to coordinate their activities, Tipton's attorney said: I have specifically put up Chinese walls to make sure Charlie (law clerk) is in no way involved with the Tipton campaign, and Im in no way involved with the Colorado Future Fund.[22]
He and Jean Tipton have been married for over 30 years. They have two daughters, Liesl and Elizabeth.[citation needed]"
"77","","2015","1959","Colorado 4","Princeton University, University of Wyoming","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Buck","Ken Buck","Republican","Weld County District Attorney, 2010 U.S. Senate nominee","unspecified Christian","Kenneth Robert ""Ken"" Buck (born February 16, 1959) is an American politician who is the U.S. Representative for Colorado's 4th congressional district. A Republican, he previously served the District Attorney for Weld County, Colorado. Buck was also the unsuccessful Republican challenger to Michael Bennet in the 2010 Senate race in Colorado.


Buck was born in Ossining, New York in 1959.[2] He and his two brothers were encouraged by their parents, both New York lawyers, to attend Ivy League colleges,[3] and Buck earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 1981. Buck later said that the Princeton degree was ""more important to [my father] than me"".[3] Buck played four years of football at Princeton, one year as a defensive back/punter/kicker and three years as a punter, earning All-Ivy League honors as a punter his senior year.[4]
After college Buck moved west and worked in Wyoming at the state legislative services office and received a law degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 1985. He was also an instructor at the University of Denver Law School and for the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in Colorado.
In 1986, he was hired by Congressman Dick Cheney to work on the Iran-Contra investigation. Following that assignment, he worked as a prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington D.C.[5]
In 1990 Buck joined the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado where he became Chief of the Criminal Division. Buck was formally reprimanded and required to take ethics classes in 2001 for a meeting he had with defense attorneys about a felony case he thought should not be pursued.[3][6] Only one of the three men initially indicted on felony charges was convicted, for a misdemeanor offense.[6] Buck said he is ""not proud"" of the incident that effectively ended his career with the Justice Department,[6] but says he felt it was ""unethical"" to prosecute such a ""weak"" case against the three men.[7] One of the three men donated $700 to Buck's 2010 Senate campaign.[6]
Buck was elected the District Attorney for Weld County, Colorado in 2004. When he suspected that Social Security numbers were being stolen by illegal immigrants, he raided a tax service in Greeley, Colorado and seized more than 5,000 tax files. The American Civil Liberties Union sued Buck's office for violating the privacy of the service's clients and after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court, costing the county approximately $150,000, the raid was deemed unconstitutional.[3] Buck has said that his time enforcing laws for the Justice Department and Weld County stoked his desire to become a lawmaker himself.[3]
During the 2010 Senate race, The Colorado Independent ran an article entitled ""Suspect in 2005 Buck rape case said he knew it was rape,"".[8] The article, about a case Buck refused to prosecute in 2006, included a complete transcript of a tape between the victim and her attacker, including the following dialogue:
Victim: You do realize that  its rape.
Suspect: Yeah, I do.
Victim: Like in a number of different ways, because I didnt want to do it and because I was intoxicated and because I was afraid.
Suspect: Yes I do. I know.
The tape, which Greeley police had the victim record during their investigation, was available before Buck made his decision not to prosecute the woman's admitted rapist. According to a following article in the Independent, ""Bucks refusal to prosecute 2005 rape case reverberates in U.S. Senate race,""[9] the reporter provides a transcript of another tape of a conversation between the woman and Buck, in which ""Buck appears to all but blame her for the rape and tells her that her case would never fly with a Weld County jury.""
A jury could very well conclude that this is a case of buyers remorse, he told the Greeley Tribune in 2006.[10]
That comment made me feel horrible, the victim told the Colorado Independent in 2010. The offender admitted he did it, but Ken Buck said I was to blame. Had he (Buck) not attacked me, I might have let it go. But he put the blame on me, and I was furious. I still am furious, she said. According to the Independent, ""A man entered the alleged victims apartment and had sex with her while she was drunk, she says. As she passed in and out of consciousness, she says she told him no and tried to push him away. If he had been a stranger, the case may have played out differently, but he was a former lover, and she had invited him over.""
In the meeting that she recorded, Buck said, It appears to me  that you invited him over to have sex with him,"" and that he thought she might have wanted to file rape charges to retaliate against the man for some bad feeling left over from when they had been lovers more than a year earlier. According the Independent, ""Buck also comes off on this tape as being at least as concerned with the womans sexual history and alcohol consumption as he is with other facts of the case.""
Drawing on Buck's abortion stance, the Independent also points out that ""The suspect in this case had claimed that the victim had at one point a year or so before this event become pregnant with his child and had an abortion, which she denies, saying she miscarried. The suspects claim, though, is in the police report, and Buck refers to it as a reason she may be motivated to file charges where he thinks none are warranted."" [11]
Buck opposes abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, but makes exceptions if the mothers life is in danger.[12]
Buck supports the U.S. military's ""Dont ask, dont tell"" policy. He said, I do not support the repeal of don't ask don't tell. I think it is a policy that makes a lot of sense.[13] Buck believes that being gay is a choice. He said, ""I think birth has an influence over it, like alcoholism but I think that basically you have a choice.""[14] The Log Cabin Republicans have rebuked him for this comment.[15]
He opposes the health care reform laws that were enacted in 2010. He instead favors free market-based reforms.[16] His campaign website states, We need to let the market work, make people responsible for their own insurance, and restore Americans' freedom to decide for themselves whether and how much insurance to buy.[17] He supported a state constitutional amendment that would give rights to unborn fetuses, but then later withdrew his support reportedly after he found out that the measure would have restricted certain fertility and contraception procedures.[18]
Buck proposed privatizing Veterans Administration hospitals so they would ""be better run"".[19] Three months later, Buck changed positions and his campaign said, ""...while Buck does indeed believe that private sector providers might do a better job than the VA in delivering health care to veterans, he is not in favor of fully privatizing health care for veterans.""[20]
Buck supports a revamp of the Department of Education and questions the department's constitutionality.[16] Buck supports gun rights and is endorsed by Gun Owners of America. He stated that he would ""oppose any federal legislation to compile a database of gun owners or to further proscribe Americans' freedoms under the Second Amendment"".[21] He also stated that if elected to the Senate he would never raise taxes.[16]
In an October, 2010 meeting with supporters in Fort Collins, Colorado, Buck endorsed the views of Senator James Inhofe, saying ""Sen. Inhofe was the first person to stand up and say this global warming is the greatest hoax that has been perpetrated. The evidence just keeps supporting his view, and more and more peoples view, of whats going on.""[22] According to a Buck spokesman, ""Ken believes there is global warming but thinks the evidence points to it being natural rather than man-made.""[23]
Angered by what he later called the nation's ""lurch to the left,[7] Buck announced his plans to run for U.S. senator on April 28, 2009.[24] In his first run for state-wide office, Buck frequently referenced national issues in defining his goals as a U.S. senator. Among these were his opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (a program of federal economic stimulus initiated under President George W. Bush and finalized under President Barack Obama) and the role of federal policy czars.[7] Buck also stressed mounting governmental debt, an issue to which he was to frequently return throughout the primary campaign.[7] Buck, contrasting himself to what he argued was the ""top down"" style of early Republican favorite Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton, also pledged a ""bottom-up"" campaign that would include visits to each of Colorado's 64 counties.[7]
Initially Norton was seen to have had a nearly insurmountable advantage against ""a band of underfunded unknowns"" that included Buck, who early in the primary season was called ""a dead-in-the-water Republican U.S. Senate candidate with laughable fundraising totals and little establishment GOP support"". Norton's staff at the beginning of the campaign was twice the size of Buck's. He attempted to make a virtue of his meager war chest by positioning ""himself as the small-money underdog"" in an election cycle that saw a ""populist push for outsider candidates to upset the Washington establishment"".[25]
After receiving nearly $600,000 in a television advertising support from Americans for Job Security and a victory in March at the state party's caucuses, Buck began to receive endorsements and notice. By late spring of 2010, Colorado had highly competitive Republican and Democratic primaries.[25]
Although Buck positioned himself as the candidate for the Tea Party movement during the Republican primary,[26] he stirred controversy at times with remarks critical of former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a Tea Party favorite, and the statement ""Will you tell those dumbasses at the Tea Party to stop asking questions about birth certificates while I'm on the camera?""  a reference to those suspicious of President Barack Obama's place of birth. Buck blamed the comments on his exhaustion and frustration after months of campaigning, and on his exasperation that it was difficult to keep campaign debate focused on the issue of mounting governmental debt.[27] Tea Party leader Lu Busse criticized Buck's ""choice of words"" and inclination to treat all Tea Party adherents as a uniform group.[28]
Buck again stirred controversy by suggesting voters should cast their votes for him over Norton because, unlike his female competitor, ""I do not wear high heels.""[29][30] Buck later stated that he was responding to Norton's television ad claiming he was not ""man enough"" to attack her himself.[31] (According to mass email, sent on behalf of Senator Jim DeMint, it was a joking paraphrase of his opponent's suggestion to vote for her, ""because I wear high heels"").
Making reference to Buck's mandatory ethics classes, Norton argued that she ""didn't need an ethics class to know what's right. ... Ken broke the rules, and the facts speak for themselves.""[32] After Buck's former supervisor, U.S. Attorney John Suthers, endorsed Norton, the Colorado Democratic Party Chair called for Buck's resignation from his Weld County post because of his ""career bypassing justice and ethics to reward political allies and campaign contributors"".[32]
On August 10, Buck defeated Norton in the Republican primary election by a 52% to 48% margin,[33] the end of ""a bitterly contested primary that saw him go from an obscure and cash-starved underdog to a gaffe-prone mascot for anti-establishment conservatives [in Colorado] and nationally.""[34]
In the November general election, Buck was defeated by Senator Michael Bennet.
On August 19, 2013, Buck emailed supporters and announced that the lymphoma he had been diagnosed with was in remission following treatment and he would run against Senator Mark Udall in 2014. He had already filed to run on August 7, 2013, before he sent out the email.[35] In March 2014, Buck withdrew from the race following the entrance of Rep. Cory Gardner, and decided to run for Gardner's House seat instead.[36]
Buck won the Republican primary, defeating three other candidates, with 44% of the vote[37] and proceeded to win the general election, defeating Democratic nominee Vic Meyers with 65% of the vote.[38]
Buck married his Princeton girlfriend in 1984, and they divorced in 1994. His mother introduced him to his current wife, Perry, after meeting her at a gathering for antiques collectors; they married in 1996. Formerly a successful banker and businesswoman, Perry Buck has ""given up much of her professional life"" to support her husband in his Senate campaign.[39] He has two children from his first marriage. Son Cody (born 1988) is a 2011 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. Daughter Kaitlin (born 1991) received college credit to work on her father's 2010 Senate campaign.[39]"

""Doug"" Lamborn (born May 24, 1954) is the U.S. Representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district, in office since 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Colorado Springs.


Born in Leavenworth, Kansas, Lamborn earned a B.S. in journalism from the University of Kansas in 1978 and J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1985. Lamborn moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado and became a private attorney focusing on business and real estate law.[1][2]
In 1994, Lamborn was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives. In 1998, he was elected to the Colorado State Senate.
He was elected Republican House Whip in 1997. He was elected Senate President Pro-tem in 1999. Lamborn served in the Colorado Senate until winning a seat in Congress.[3]
While in the State Senate Lamborn sponsored the largest tax cut in Colorado State history,[4] and was named the highest-ranking tax cutter in the Senate five times, by a conservative activist group called the Colorado Union of Taxpayers.[3]
Lamborn was the ranking Republican on the Colorado State Military and Veterans Affairs, and Appropriations committees.
On February 16, 2006, Joel Hefley announced he would retire after 10 terms in Congress.[5] In the Republican primary to succeed him, Hefley backed his long-time aide, former administrative director Jeff Crank. The election was held on August 8, 2006, with Lamborn defeating Crank and four other candidates to win the party nomination in a contentious six-way race. Hefley was incensed at the tactics used in the election, particularly a mailed brochure from the Christian Coalition of Colorado associating Crank with ""public support for members and efforts of the homosexual agenda."" Hefley said that he ""suspected, but couldn't prove, collusion between Lamborn's campaign, which is managed by Jon Hotaling, and the Christian Coalition of Colorado, which is run by Hotaling's brother, Mark."" [6] Hefley called it ""one of the sleaziest, most dishonest campaigns I've seen in a long time,""[6] and, as a result, refused to endorse Lamborn. In the Republican primary, Lamborn ran on conservative positions:[7] opposing gun control, abortion except when the mother's life is threatened, federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, not providing public benefits to illegal immigrants, and new eminent domain rulings.[8]
He ran against Lieutenant Colonel Jay Fawcett, the Democratic nominee for the open seat in Colorado's 5th congressional district. Lamborn won the election on November 7, 2006.
Jeff Crank and Major General Bentley Rayburn[9] both challenged Lamborn in the 2008 Republican primary. Both lost to Lamborn in the 2006 primary. Lamborn won the primary election on August 12, 2008 with 45 percent[10] of the 56,171 votes cast. Crank got 29 percent and Rayburn got 26 percent.
Lamborn defeated Democratic challenger Lieutenant Colonel Hal Bidlack in the 2008 election.
Lamborn was challenged by Democratic nominee Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Bradley. He won re-election.
Lamborn was challenged in the Republican primary by businessman Robert Blaha. Lamborn won 62-38 percent.[11] Lamborn carries the support of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum political action committee.[12]
Lamborn is being challenged by Democratic nominee Major General Irv Halter.
An office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was established in Colorado Springs in Lamborn's district. The office opened in February 2009 and increased immigration enforcement agents in the area from two to ten. The immediate need is to address those that have committed a crime and make sure theyre sent out of the country, Lamborn said. However this would not place in jeopardy employers who hire illegal immigrants in the first place or who pay these workers without any withholding tax or below the minimum wage.[13]
There has also been a Brigade Combat Team in his district since December 2007. The Brigade Combat Team consisting of almost 5,000 soldiers, their families, support personnel as well as increased military construction.[14]
Congressional Quarterly said that through the first August recess, Lamborn had voted by strict partisan lines the most of any member in the U.S. House and more than any other Republican.[7] Lamborn led an effort among conservative Republicans to force the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to discard proposed regulations that would have affected accessibility to small arms ammunition, which were opposed by Second Amendment groups.[15] In February 2010, The National Journal named Lamborn the most conservative member of the U.S. House of Representatives.[16]
Lamborn is one of the House Republicans leading the effort against public funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR (National Public Radio). ""I have been seeking to push Big Bird out of the nest for over a year, based on the simple fact that we can no longer afford to spend taxpayer dollars on nonessential government programs. It's time for Big Bird to earn his wings and learn to fly on his own."" [17]
On August 24, 2007, Jonathan Bartha, who works for Focus on the Family (headquartered in Colorado Springs), and his wife Anna wrote a letter to the editor in a community newspaper expressing concerns about Lamborn's opposition to more restrictions on dog fighting. They were also concerned that he'd taken several campaign contributions from the gaming industry. A few days later, Lamborn left two voice mails threatening ""consequences"" if they didn't renounce their ""blatantly false"" letter. He also said that he would be ""forced to take other steps"" if the matter wasn't resolved ""on a Scriptural level."" The Barthas were shocked by the messages, and Anna Bartha called Lamborn's behavior ""not anything we would ever anticipate an elected official would pursue.""[18]
Lamborn is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[19]
In 2008 Lamborn signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[20]
On July 29, 2011, Lamborn appeared on a Denver radio program to discuss the debt crisis and the failure of Democrats and Republicans to reach a compromise on the problem. Lamborn stated ""Now, I don't even want to have to be associated with [President Obama]. It's like touching a tar baby and you get it, you're stuck, and you're a part of the problem now and you can't get away.""[21] The term tar baby is sometimes considered to be a racial slur used towards African-Americans. Former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll, himself an African-American, replied ""Looking beyond the fact that Congressman Lamborns entire comment is nonsensical, his use of the term tar baby is unfortunate because [of] the historical connotation of that term when used in conjunction with African Americans.""[22]
On August 1, 2011, Lamborn apologized for his use of the slur, explaining """"When I said 'tar baby', I was talking economic quagmire that our country is finding ourselves in because of poor economic policy from the White House. I could have used a better term.""[23]
On January 23, 2012, Lamborn announced he would not be attending the President's State of the Union address. According to his spokeswoman Catherine Mortenson, ""Congressman Lamborn is doing this to send a clear message that he does not support the policies of Barack Obama, that they have hurt our country,"" and he believed Obama was in full campaign mode and will use the address as an opportunity to bash his political opponents.""[24]
On April 11, 2013, Lamborn read out in an open session broadcast on C-SPAN an unclassified section from a classified report on North Korean nuclear capabilities. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs refused to confirm the classified report.[25] The Pentagon later confirmed that the Defense Intelligence Agency had marked that sentence as unclassified mistakenly.[26]
Doug Lamborn is one of the 80 members of the House that signed a letter to the speaker of the house, urging the threat of a government shutdown to defund Obamacare. This group was named the ""Suicide Caucus"".[27] He voted against the measure that finally ended the shutdown on October 16, 2013 [28]
September 13, 2014, during a question & answer part of his speech, Doug Lamborn made controversial remarks concerning President Obama's foreign policy. According to reports, Doug Lamborn is quoted to have said ""A lot of us are talking to the generals behind the scenes, saying, Hey, if you disagree with the policy that the White House has given you, lets have a resignation. You know, lets have a public resignation, and state your protest, and go out in a blaze of glory!'"" [29]
Lamborn supported Senate bill 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage activities or a terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[30] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as their ambassador.[31] Aboutalebi was controversial due to his involvement in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[31][32][33] Lamborn said that the selection by Iran of Aboutalebi as their U.N. ambassador was ""unconscionable and unacceptable.""[31] He argued that this legislation was needed in order to give the President the ""authority he needs to deny this individual a visa.""[31]"

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the Secretary of State of Colorado (20072009) and as Colorado State Treasurer (19992005 & 20062007).


Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the United States Army at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado.
In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the University of Colorado, under the G.I. Bill graduating in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in political science.[5][6] He also studied at Vaishnav College in Chennai, India, and the University of Veracruz in Mexico for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the United States Marine Corps in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the Marine Reserves, serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based property management firm, serving as senior shareholder until 2000.
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1989 to 1995. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the Persian Gulf War, during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service. Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator Bill Owens resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the Colorado State Senate unopposed.[7] He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.[8]
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.[9] In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator Terry Phillips.[10]
He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the War in Iraq, where he helped support the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected Colorado Secretary of State with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.[11]
Coffman announced that he would run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Republican Tom Tancredo in 2008 in Colorado's 6th congressional district. Three other candidates decided to run in the Republican primary for the open seat: Wil Armstrong (son of former U.S. Senator Bill Armstrong), State Senator Ted Harvey, and State Senator Steve Ward. Coffman won the August primary with a plurality of 40% of the vote, beating runner-up Wil Armstrong by seven points.[12]
During the general election, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006. Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.[13] Soon after the accusations were made, Common Cause filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state. The secretary of state's office denied wrongdoing, and Coffman said he believes his office was correctly applying the law.[14] On October 30, 2008, the court approved a preliminary injunction allowing purged voters to participate in the 2008 election.[15] Bernie Buescher, Coffman's successor as secretary of state, replaced Coffman as defendant in the case in January 2009.[16] The bulk of the litigation was settled in January 2010 after changes to Colorado's election regulations, and the remaining portions were decided in January 2011.
The Denver Post endorsed Coffman on October 10, 2008.[17] In November, Coffman defeated Democrat Hank Eng, an Appleton, Wisconsin City Common Councilman, 61%-39%.[18] Governor Bill Ritter designated State Representative Bernie Buescher, a Democrat, to succeed Coffman as Secretary of State.[19]
Coffman defeated Democrat John Flerlage 66%-31%.[20]
In redistricting, Colorado's 6th congressional district was made more favorable to Democrats than previously. Aurora was added to the district.[21]
Democratic State Representative Joe Miklosi challenged Coffman.[22] During a campaign fundraiser in Elbert County on May 12, 2012, Coffman expressed doubt that President Barack Obama had been born in the United States and declared that: ""I don't know whether Barack Obama was born in the United States of America. I don't know that. But I do know this, that in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American.""[23] Coffman apologized several days later saying that, ""I misspoke and I apologize, and I have confidence in President Obama's citizenship and legitimacy as President of the United States.""[24] In September 2012, Coffman, alluding to a Washington Post article by Jack Anderson about the timing of the Carter administration's attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran, said that he had a ""fundamental concern"" that President Obama would similarly use the military in an attempted October surprise conspiracy. Coffman stated, Ive always been concerned about any president using the military unnecessarily for political reasons, regardless of who that president is.[25]
Coffman defeated Miklosi 48%-46%, a difference of 6,992 votes. At the same time, Obama defeated Romney in the district 52%-47%.[26] Miklosi won the Arapahoe County part of the district 48%-45%. Coffman made up the deficit by winning Adams County 46%-45% and Douglas County 60%-35%.[27]
Coffman ran for re-election to the U.S. House in 2014. He won the Republican nomination in the primary election on June 24, 2014, unopposed. [28] He faced Democrat Andrew Romanoff in the general election. Coffman won 52%-43%.
In 2011, Coffman proposed a half billion dollars in cuts to military programs such as education reimbursements, the Selective Service and the military's health plan, TRICARE, saying that the programs ""have been neglected for a long time. Every dollar wasted is a dollar not going to our war fighters. What they do is important to this country, and we should focus on them.""[29]
Coffman introduced the Veterans Paralympic Act of 2013 (H.R. 1402; 113th Congress) into the House on March 25, 2013.[30] It is a bill that would help fund disabled veterans who want to compete in the Paralympic Games.[31]
In response to a 2013 Gazette report about veterans with mental health conditions, such as Post-traumatic stress disorder, being stripped of medical benefits, Coffman sponsored a 2014 amendment that would allow servicemen with mental health issues who were discharged because of misconduct to appeal for medical discharge instead.[32]
On March 14, 2014, Coffman introduced the Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress), a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill would make the RAC an independent organization within the VA, require that a majority of the RAC's members be appointed by Congress instead of the VA, and state the RAC can release its reports without needing prior approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.[33][34] The RAC is responsible for investigating Gulf War syndrome, a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military veterans and civilian workers of the Gulf War.[35]
Coffman was the first congressman to call for Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki to resign after misconduct at multiple VA facilities was revealed.[36] On May 30, 2014, Shinseki resigned as Secretary.[37][38]
In August 2014, Coffman broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.[39]
Coffman is anti-abortion, supports the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision, and supports maintaining access to birth control for women.[40] In early 2014, Coffman announced that he no longer supports personhood laws.[41][42] He opposes federally-mandated background checks for gun purchases.[43]
Coffman's wife, Cynthia Coffman was elected Colorado Attorney General in 2014. She previously served as Chief Deputy Attorney General in the office of Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, and as Chief Counsel in the office of then-Governor Bill Owens.[44]
Coffman is a Methodist.[45]"

The district is located in the northwestern suburbs of Denver. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Perlmutter was born in Denver, the son of Alice Love (ne Bristow) and Leonard Michael Perlmutter. His father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from Ukraine; his mother was Christian, and was of English and Irish descent.[3] Perlmutter describes himself as a Christian.[1][4][5] Perlmutter graduated from Jefferson High School in Edgewater, Colorado and went on to study political science, history and economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, graduating in 1975. He received his Juris Doctor from CU in 1978 where he was twice elected President of his class while working part time as a laborer on construction projects.[citation needed]
Perlmutter was formerly a director of the law firm of Berenbaum Weinshienk, and specialized in business reorganizations and commercial litigation.[citation needed]
Perlmutter was a Colorado State Senator from 1995 to 2003. He was elected to two four-year terms to represent central Jefferson County as State Senator from 1995 to 2003the first Democrat elected in the district in 30 years.
In 2000, he helped lead a team that succeeded in a Democratic takeover of the Colorado State Senate for the first time since John F. Kennedy was president. He has assisted numerous campaigns and most recently was co-chair of the Kerry Campaign in Colorado.
In the Colorado Senate, he served on numerous Colorado State Senate committees including: Water, Finance, Judiciary, Child Welfare, Telecommunication, Transportation, Legal Services, and Oil and Gas.[citation needed]
Perlmutter won the Democratic nomination for the 7th District by defeating former State Representative Peggy Lamm and college professor Herb Rubenstein, with 53% of the vote in the primary. State education chairman Rick O'Donnell was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Dave Chandler, a Green, was also a candidate.
The seat was held by Republican Bob Beauprez, who was reelected to a second term in 2004 with 55% of the vote, after winning his first term by only 121 votes. He left the seat at the end of the 20042006 term, having failed in his bid to become Governor of Colorado.
In late September, O'Donnell was put on the defensive when ads appeared noting that he had previously supported abolishing Social Security. A Survey USA poll soon after that showed Perlmutter with a 54 to 37 percent lead, although GOP consultants guessed that the support was ""soft"".[6] An October 4 poll released by Zogby showed Perlmutter ahead of O'Donnell by 45-34 percent.[7] Cook Political Report rating: Republican Toss Up. CQPolitics rating: No Clear Favorite.
In the end, Perlmutter (54%) soundly defeated O'Donnell (42%) for the congressional seat, helping Democrats to regain the majority in the U.S. House.
Perlmutter won against Republican nominee John W. Lerew.[citation needed]
Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee Ryan Frazier and Libertarian nominee Buck Bailey on November 2, 2010. The 7th Congressional district had been cited as a GOP target in 2010.[8]
Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee Joe Coors Jr. on November 6, 2012. Perlmutter's victory came despite new congressional boundaries that made his district 4 percent less Democratic. Perlmutter was ahead by 9 percentage points in Jefferson County, where 60 percent of the voters live. Perlmutter led Coors by 17 percentage points in Adams County, where 40 percent of the constituents in the newly drawn 7th District live.[9]
Perlmutter has three children. He and his first wife, Deana, divorced in 2008. In November 2010, Perlmutter married Nancy Henderson.[10] Nancy Perlmutter teaches mathematics at Pomona High School and has three adult children."

Larson","Democratic","Connecticut Senate, East Hartford, Connecticut City Council, East Hartford, Connecticut Board of Education","Roman Catholic","John Barry Larson (born July 22, 1948) is the U.S. Representative for Connecticut's 1st congressional district, serving since 1999. The district is based in the state capital, Hartford. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Larson is the former chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.


Larson was born in Hartford, but has spent most of his life in nearby East Hartford. He grew up in a public housing project. He was educated at East Hartford High School and Central Connecticut State University. He worked as a high school history teacher and an assistant athletics coach at George J. Penney High School (later Penney High merged with East Hartford High School). Larson was also the co-owner of an insurance agency in East Hartford before entering public service. In 1971, he was selected as a Senior Fellow to the Yale University Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy by the Head Start Program founder, Edward Zigler.
Larson began his political career in 1977, when he served one term on the East Hartford Board of Education. He then served two terms on the East Hartford Town Council.
In 1982, Larson was elected to the Connecticut Senate from the 3rd district, based in East Hartford. He served six terms in that body, the last four as President pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate.
In 1994, Larson left the state senate and sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Connecticut but was defeated by Bill Curry in the primary. After being defeated for Governor, Larson entered private business for several years but was able to maintain his political credentials. Due in part to service in the Democratic Party and his local connections in the state, he narrowly defeated Secretary of State Miles Rappaport in the Democratic primary for the 1st District when 17-year incumbent Barbara Kennelly gave up the seat to run for governor in 1998. This was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. He has been re-elected six times with no substantive opposition.
On February 1, 2006 he was elected Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The previous vice chairman, Jim Clyburn, moved up to chairman when Bob Menendez was appointed to the United States Senate. After the Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, Larson opted not to run for caucus chairmana post that went to former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Rahm Emanuel, instead running unopposed for re-election as vice chairman. After being re-elected in 2008, Larson was elected chairman of the Caucus for the 111th Congress, after Emanuel was named White House Chief of Staff.[1]
Larson has introduced various pieces of legislation in attempts to nationalize the USs energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect the environment. Larson cosponsored the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to move the United States toward greater energy independence and security, to increase the production of clean renewable fuels, to protect consumers, to increase the efficiency of products, buildings, and vehicles, to promote research on and deploy greenhouse gas capture and storage options, and to improve the energy performance of the Federal Government, and for other purposes. [2] According to Larson, I have become convinced of the need for comprehensive legislation to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we are emitting into the environment. [3] Larsons stances on environmental protection have earned him a rating of 100% with the League of Conservation Voters.[4]
In 2010 Larson introduced the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorizing the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund Program administered by the Treasury Department to make capital investments in eligible institutions, in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses. Larson is a strong advocate for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which increases federal spending in infrastructure, education, health and energy as well as expanding certain welfare and social security programs. Larsons liberal stance on government spending has earned him a rating of 9% with Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative anti-government spending interest group.[5]
Larson received media attention for scolding members of Congress for shutting down the government on September 30, 2013.[6]
Larson has voted consistently to both legalize same-sex marriage, and to expand options for legal abortion. Larson voted to repeal the militarys dont ask dont tell policy, and voted in favor of the Sexual Orientation Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA).[7] The Human Rights Campaign gave Larson a rating of 94%. Larson also voted not to end federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Thus, Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice American both gave Larson a rating of 100%.[8]

The district includes most of the eastern third of the state, including Norwich and New London. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Courtney grew up in suburban Hartford. In 1975 he graduated from Tufts University. He earned a law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1978.
After graduating from law school, Courtney worked as a public defender for three years. He became a partner in the law firm Courtney, Boyan & Foran, and also served as Town Attorney in Vernon, Connecticut, where he lives.
From 1987 to 1994, Courtney served in the Connecticut House of Representatives, representing Connecticut's 56th district. He was chairman of the Public Health and Human Service Committee and oversaw the Blue Ribbon Commission on Universal Health Insurance. In 1994, he was honored by Connecticut Magazine for his bipartisan efforts in the state house.
In 1998, after four years out of office, Courtney made an unsuccessful bid for Lieutenant Governor. In 2002, he ran for Congress against incumbent Republican Rob Simmons. Courtney did not announce his candidacy or raise money until September 2001; by that time, Simmons had more than $500,000 in campaign funding. Simmons defeated Courtney in the November election, 54% to 46%.[2]
Courtney challenged Simmons again in 2006, in a race that political strategists projected would be very close. Courtney was declared the winner on Election Day; initial tallies showed him ahead by 167 votes, out of more than 242,000 votes. Under Connecticut law the race qualified for an automatic re-canvass because the winning margin was less than one half percent. The recount, finished on November 14, showed Courtney with 91 votes more than Simmons.[3]
Courtney's 2008 Republican challenger was the former commanding officer of the Naval Submarine Base New London, Sean Sullivan.[4] Courtney won the election by a two-to-one margin.[5][6][7]
On May 21, 2008, he announced his endorsement of then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama for president.
Courtney was challenged by Republican nominee Janet Peckinpaugh, Green Party nominee Scott Deshefy, and Libertarian write-in Dan Reale. Courtney was re-elected to another term.[8]
Courtney will face off against businesswoman Lori Hopkins-Cavanagh in November. Hopkins-Cavanagh is a business owner and radio show host from New London, Connecticut.
In 2010, Courtney was the leading voice in the House against the so-called ""Cadillac tax"" on high-dollar health plans, part of the funding proposed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Patricia Murphy (January 11, 2010). ""'Cadillac' Tax' Puts Obama on Collision Course With House Democrats"". Politics Daily.
Prior to the 112th Congress, Courtney served on the Committee on Education and Labor with membership on the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning, and Competitiveness and Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.
Courtney lives with his wife, a nurse practitioner, and two children in Vernon, a suburb of Hartford."
"83","","1991","1943","Connecticut 3","Marymount College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_DeLauro","Rosa DeLauro","Democratic","Executive Director of EMILY's List, Political aide","Roman Catholic","Rosa Luisa DeLauro[1] (born March 2, 1943) is the U.S. Representative for Connecticut's 3rd congressional district, serving since 1991. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is based in New Haven, and includes most of that city's suburbs.


DeLauro was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the daughter of Luisa ""Louise"" (ne Canestri) and Theodore J. ""Ted"" DeLauro. Her father, and all of her grandparents, were Italian immigrants.[2] She earned her high school diploma from The Academy of Our Lady of Mercy, Lauralton Hall in Milford, Connecticut. She earned a bachelor's degree from Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York, as well as separate master's degrees from the London School of Economics and Columbia University.
DeLauro worked as an administrative assistant and chief of staff for Senator Chris Dodd and executive director of EMILY's List before entering the House.
In 1990, four-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Bruce Morrison of Connecticut's 3rd congressional district decided to retire to run for governor of Connecticut. She ran for the open seat and defeated Republican State Senator Thomas Scott 52%-48%.[3] She has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected twelve times, never dropping below 63% of the vote.[4]
In the 2006 election she was re-elected to a ninth term, defeating Republican challenger Joseph Vollano with 76% of the vote.[5]
She won re-election to her tenth term with 77% of the vote.[6] The top campaign contribution to DeLauro in 2007-2008 was $14,600 from employees of United Technologies.
DeLauro won re-election to her eleventh term with 65% of the vote against Connecticut Republican Party treasurer Jerry Labriola Jr.[7][8]
DeLauro is one of the most liberal members of the House. She is a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Rosa DeLauro is active on health policy issues, particularly women's health. She has introduced numerous bills aimed at improving cancer treatment and research and women's health policies. As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, she has been an outspoken critic of that agency's failures to protect the public from unsafe foods and medical products.
In May 2006, she was linked in press reports to U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd's potential bid for President in 2008. On February 2, 2008, DeLauro endorsed Illinois Senator Barack Obama for President at her home in New Haven, Connecticut.[9]
On October 3, 2008, DeLauro voted a second time in the House in favor the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to help stabilize an economic crisis.[10] She worked to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. She has urged politicians to be ""big thinkers"" on the issue of universal health care.[11]
The Wall Street Journal reported on December 17, 2008, that DeLauro was ""a top contender"" for the position of Labor Secretary in the Obama administration.[12] However, President-elect Obama announced the nomination of fellow congresswoman Hilda Solis for the position on December 19.[13]
DeLauro was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.
DeLauro is pro-choice. She supports the availability of abortions in all cases. Additionally, representative DeLauro supports the use of federal subsidies for abortion procedures. In 2006 DeLauro voted against HR 6099, a bill that would require abortion providers to follow specific procedures and formalities before performing abortions. She also voted no in 2006 on a bill that makes the transportation of pregnant women under the age of 18 across state lines in order to obtain an abortion illegal.[14] DeLauro has faced criticism from the Roman Catholic Church, of which she is a member, over her pro-choice position. It is Catholic doctrine that abortion is a sin; however, as a representative of the U.S. government and not the Catholic Church, DeLauro, along with many other Catholics in the U.S. Government, has voted in favor of measures that support the availability of safe and legal abortion services.
She has consistently voted in support of stronger regulation of firearms in the United States. In 2006 she voted against the Trigger Lock Amendment that ends the use of funds from the Commerce Department FY2007 Appropriation bill to enforce laws requiring guns to be sold with locks.[15] Additionally, DeLauro voted in 1999 to increase the amount of time given to perform background checks from 24 hours to 72 hours.[16] Earlier, in 1998 she voted to increase the minimum gun crime sentence.[17] On 14 January 2013, she introduced a bill allowing for the voluntary surrender of assault-type weapons with compensation to come in the form of tax credits.[18]
In June 2010 representative DeLauro voted in favor of a bill for new disclosure requirements for political advertising. She voted against the 527 Reform Act of 2005, an act that put an end to party spending limits for candidates during general elections and again against the 527 Reform Act of 2006. DeLauro also helped to pass the Lobbying and Donation Regulations bill that put in place new regulations about lobbyists and donations for Congress members.
In 2002 DeLauro voted for the Help America Vote Act of 2002. This act provided, from Federal funds, $3.9 billion to modernize technology and create new programs to reach a higher standard and to make voting an easier process for disabled citizens, military personnel, citizens living abroad, and first-time voters without valid identification. Once again in 2006 representative DeLauro voted to simplify the voting process by casting her vote against the Federal Election Integrity Act of 2006 that required voters to show a government-issued photo identification before voting.[19]
DeLauro recently sponsored the Birth Defects Prevention, Risk Reduction, and Awareness Act of 2010 (H.R. 5462). This bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a birth defects prevention, risk reduction, and awareness program that will cost Americans less than one dollar from 2011 to 2015. The program will increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding by starting a nationwide media campaign and provide grants for research on certain exposures that affect pregnancy and breastfed infants. Most recently, on the fifteenth of November, 2010, this bill was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and Pensions.[20]
DeLauro introduced HR 875,[21] The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. This legislation is aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled by the FDA. The introduction of this bill represents a potential conflict of interest, because of her husband's, Stanley Greenberg, current relation to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.[22]
In August 2011, the 3rd District suffered extreme damage when Hurricane Irene made landfall along the Connecticut coastline. Numerous homes were destroyed in East Haven[23] and other shore communities and the vast majority of Connecticut residents lost power for many days.[24] At the time Hurricane Irene hit the state and during the immediate aftermath, DeLauro was vacationing along Italy's Amalfi Coast and was not anticipated to return to the state until 5 days after the storm had passed.[25] A Hartford Courant column rated DeLauro's storm response an ""F"".[26] Nonetheless, DeLauro told the New Haven Register she had ""no apology for taking a vacation"" and being out of state during the storm.[27]
In July 2014, DeLauro introduced Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act, also known as the ""SWEET Act"", which would impose a 1 cent excise tax per teaspoon of caloric sweetener in soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweet teas (roughly 9 cents on a 12 oz. soda).[28] This act is intended to discourage excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by increasing the price of these products, according to the text of the legislation. DeLauro and other supporters of the tax argue that it could help address the national epidemics of obesity and diabetes by discouraging consumers from consuming the products and also raise money to fund prevention and treatment programs and with research and dietary education to help reduce the costs of related health problems.[29] The bill was subsequently co-sponsored by several House members and progressed on to the House Energy and Commerce committee for Health and the House Ways and Means committee, but went no further.[30]
The bill was opposed by the American Beverage Association and the National Automatic Merchandising Association[31] (NAMA) stating that ""People dont support taxes and bans on common grocery items, like soft drinks."" and that sweetened beverages ""are not the main source of added sugars for children and teens and that a tax on sugary drinks unfairly singles out the industry.""[29]
DeLauro is married to political strategist Stan Greenberg.
DeLauro celebrated 25 years as an ovarian cancer survivor in 2010. She continues to support biomedical research, including efforts to develop a reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. [32]
DeLauro is one of the fifty richest members of Congress.[33]
She is an honorary board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women. She is a leader in the group Catholic Democrats,.[34]
In May 2010, DeLauro became a brief internet sensation after the popularization of a website highlighting her allegedly Hipster wardrobe choices. Several news services picked up the story, eventually leading DeLauro to admit that while she had visited the site, she disagreed with its premise.[35][36]"

University of Delaware","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carney_(politician)","John Carney","Democratic","Lieutenant Governor of Delaware, Delaware Secretary of Finance","Roman Catholic","John Charles Carney, Jr. (born May 20, 1956) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. Representative for Delaware's at-large congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He was the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Delaware from 2001 to 2009. Prior to that, he served as Delaware's Secretary of Finance; he also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Delaware in 2008.


Carney was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Ann Marie (ne Buckley) and John Charles ""Jack"" Carney. His great-grandparents immigrated from Ireland.[1] Carney was quarterback of the 1973 state championship St. Mark's High School football team, and earned All-Ivy League and Most Valuable Player honors in football at Dartmouth College, from which he graduated in 1978. While a student at Dartmouth, he joined the local Beta Alpha Omega fraternity. He later coached freshman football at the University of Delaware, while earning his master's degree in public administration.[2][3]
Carney has served as Deputy Chief Administrative Officer of New Castle County and as Secretary of Finance and Deputy Chief of Staff for Governor Tom Carper.
He was first elected Lieutenant Governor of Delaware in 2000 and served from January 16, 2001 until January 20, 2009.
As Lieutenant Governor Carney presided over the Delaware State Senate and chaired the Board of Pardons. He was chairman of the Delaware Health Care Commission, the Interagency Council on Adult Literacy, the Criminal Justice Council, the Center for Education Technology, and the Livable Delaware Advisory Council. In 2002 he launched the education initiative ""Models of Excellence in Education"" to identify practices in schools that have raised student achievement. Carney was also selected by other Lieutenant Governors as chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Association from July 2004 to July 2005.
Carney has long been an advocate for wellness issues in Delaware, sponsoring ""BeHealthy Delaware"" and ""The Lt. Governor's Challenge"" to encourage Delawareans to be more active and address the State's high rate of chronic diseases. He fought for Delaware's public smoking ban to improve health, cut cancer rates, and discourage teens from starting to smoke.
After completing his tenure as Lieutenant Governor in 2009, Carney served as president and chief operating officer of Transformative Technologies, which is investing in the DelaWind project, to bring offshore wind turbine construction to Delaware.[4] He planned to step down in early 2010 to concentrate on his U.S. House campaign.[5]
Carney sought the Democratic nomination for the office of Governor in 2008, as incumbent Governor Ruth Ann Minner was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. However, despite the backing of most of the party establishment, Carney lost the Democratic primary by fewer than two thousand votes in a close race to State Treasurer Jack Markell, who went on to win the general election.[6]
Carney was the Democratic Party nominee for Delaware's at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2010. Carney faced Republican Glen Urquhart, Independent Party of Delaware Earl R. Lofland, Libertarian Brent A. Wangen, and Blue Enigma Jeffrey Brown. The seat had been held since 1993 by Republican Michael Castle, who declined to seek re-election to the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate seat once held by Vice President Joe Biden. In the first week of October, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15 point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%; well ahead in New Castle County (56-32) but running even with Urquhart (43-43) in the downstate counties of Kent and Sussex.[7] Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Carney leading by 17 percentage points, 53% to 36% among likely voters.[8]
Carney won the seat by 16 points, 57%-41%, and took office on January 3 of 2011. His victory was one of the three seats gained by the Democrats in a year where they suffered a net loss of 63 seats to the Republicans.
In his bid for a second term, Carney faced Republican Tom Kovach, the President of New Castle County, and two minor candidates. In a debate with Kovach, Carney stated, ""I will continue to do in Washington what I did in Delaware: work across the aisle to get things done. I learned early on that compromise is part of life."" Speaking on the Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare), Carney stated that it ""is not perfect"" but that it is the ""only chance we have to get costs under control.""[9] Carney was re-elected in a landslide, with 64% of the vote to Kovach's 33%.
Carney ran for re-election to a third term in 2014. He defeated Republican Rose Izzo by 59% to 37%, with Green Bernie August and Libertarian Scott Gesty taking 2% each.
In 2011, Carney and Illinois Republican Aaron Schock co-sponsored a bill that would use U.S. oil exploration to help fund a five-year federal highway construction project. The bill has not been voted on as of April 2012.[10][11]
On April 7, 2014, Carney introduced the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4414; 113th Congress) into the House.[12] The bill would exempt expatriate health care plans from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.[13] Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high-quality health care plans designed to meet the unique needs to expatriates.[13] Carney said that ""expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a global network of health care providers.""[13] Carney indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the tax and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans.[13]
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The Lieutenant Governor takes office the third Tuesday of January with a four-year term. U.S. Representatives take office January 3 and have a two-year term.

Yoho has been a veterinarian for the past 28 years, serving the North Central Florida area.


Yoho was born in Minnesota in 1955. At the age of 11 he moved with his family to Florida. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Agriculture at the University of Florida. He attended the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. He is a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Florida Veterinary Medical Association, Florida Association of Equine Practitioners, Florida Cattlemens Association, and the National Rifle Association.[2]
Yoho ran for the newly-redrawn Florida's 3rd congressional district.

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes just over half of Jacksonville, as well as most of its suburbs.


Crenshaw was born in Jacksonville, and earned his (BA) at the University of Georgia in 1966 and later received his law degree from the University of Florida. He was an investment banker before being elected to Congress. Crenshaw served in the Florida State House of Representatives from 1972 to 1978 and in the Florida State Senate from 1986 to 1994. He was the first Republican Senate president in 118 years. Crenshaw was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2000.
In 1978, Crenshaw won the Republican primary for Florida Secretary of State. He lost the general election to Democrat George Firestone.[1]
In 1994, he ran for Florida Governor, but lost the primary to Jeb Bush, who won with a plurality of 46%. Crenshaw got just 12% of the vote in fourth place. State Secretary of State Jim Smith and State Treasurer Tom Gallagher got 18% and 13% of the vote respectively.
Crenshaw served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1972 through 1978.
He returned to public office in 1986, winning a special election for a seat in the Florida Senate that he held through 1994. He became the first Republican elected president of the Senate in 118 years in November 1992, but agreed to serve only one year instead of the usual two, as a compromise between Republicans and Democrats who were evenly split in the Senate that year.
Crenshaw has largely kept a low profile during his congressional tenure. He is currently a Deputy Majority Whip in the Republican leadership.
On September 29, 2008, Crenshaw voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program.[2] He was one of only three Florida Republicans to do so.
Despite his support of the bill, he issued a press release to ""applaud the organizers and participants"" of the April 15, 2009, First Coast Tax Day Tea Party in Jacksonville, one of the many 2009 Tea Party protests which condemned any bailouts.[3]
On July 2, 2014, Crenshaw introduced the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 5016; 113th Congress), an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015 that would provide funding for the United States Department of the Treasury, as we all as the United States federal courts, the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and Washington, D.C..[4]
In 1980, Crenshaw finished third in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat, earning roughly 13% of the vote behind Paula Hawkins and Louis Frey, Jr..
In 1994, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor, winning several counties but ultimately losing out to Jeb Bush. Crenshaw finished fourth (12.1%) behind Tom Gallagher and Jim Smith.
In 2000, Crenshaw returned to politics when he won the Republican nomination for the 4th District after Tillie Fowler retired to honor a self-imposed four-term limit. He easily won in November, becoming only the fourth person to represent this district since its creation in 1943 (it was the 2nd District from 1943 to 1967, the 3rd District from 1967 to 1993, and has been the 4th since 1993). He has been reelected five times with no substantive opposition in what has become one of the most Republican districts in Florida. He even ran unopposed in 2002 and 2004, and faced no major-party opposition in 2010 or 2012.
Crenshaw was challenged by Independent Troy Stanley. Gary L. Koniz and Deborah ""Deb"" Katz Pueschel also qualified as write-ins.
Crenshaw is a son-in-law of former Governor of Florida Claude Roy Kirk, Jr. and has two grown daughters with his wife Kitty, whom he has been married to for over 44 years.[5]
In 2013, Ander Crenshaw was awarded the Malaria Action Award for his work against malaria by Malaria No More.[6]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes parts of Duval, Clay, Putnam, Alachua, Volusia, Marion, Lake, Seminole, and Orange counties.


Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Brown earned a bachelor of science from Florida A&M University in 1969[1][2] In college she became a member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, one of four African American Greek letter sororities in the United States. She earned a master's degree in 1971 and an educational specialist degree from the University of Florida in 1974. She received an Honorary Doctor of Law degree from Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, and has been on the faculty at the latter two schools and at Florida State College at Jacksonville.[3]
Brown served in the Florida House of Representatives for ten years beginning in 1982. From 1985 to 1991 she served as the Representative from the 17th district.
After the 1990 census, the Florida legislature carved out a new Third Congressional District in the northern part of the state. This district was designed to enclose an African-American majority within its boundaries. A horseshoe-shaped district touching on largely African-American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Gainesville, Orlando, and Ocala,[4] the Third District seemed likely to send Florida's first African-American to Congress since Reconstruction, and Brown decided to run.[5]
Brown faced several candidates in the 1992 Democratic primary, but the strongest opponent to emerge was Andy Johnson, a white talk radio host from Jacksonville. Brown defeated Johnson in the primary and in a two-candidate runoff, and went on to win the general election in November 1992.[6]
In 1995, the boundaries of the Third District were struck down by the Supreme Court due to their irregular shape.[7] One of the main instigators of the lawsuit that led to the redistricting was Brown's old political rival, Andy Johnson. Brown railed against the change, complaining that ""[t]he Bubba I beat [Johnson] couldn't win at the ballot box [so] he took it to court,"" as she was quoted as saying in the New Republic. Although the district lines were redrawn, Brown still won the 1996 election.[8]
On June 1, 2009, Brown announced she would form an exploratory committee for a possible run for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Mel Martinez saying, ""These are challenging times for Florida. Our economy is in a shambles and our families are hurting. Charlie Crist may be good at taking pictures and making promises, but what has he actually accomplished?"" [9][10] In October 2009, it was announced that Brown will not run for Senate, and will seek re-election in the House of Representatives.[11]
Corrine Brown ran in the newly-redrawn District 5, which was identified as one of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.[12] The Florida Democratic Party challenged the new district map with a lawsuit, saying, in particular, the new District 5 ""as enacted by the Florida Legislature stands out among all of the districts as presenting both the most numerous and most flagrant constitutional violations.""[13]
Brown was one of the 31 representatives who voted against counting the electoral votes from Ohio in the United States presidential election, 2004.[14] In 2006, she voted ""no"" on the Child Custody Protection Act, Public Expression of Religion Act, Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act, Military Commissions Act, and Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2006. She voted ""yes"" on the SAFE Port Act.[2] On September 29, 2008, Brown voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.[15][16]
On her 2004 political courage test at www.votesmart.org, Corrine stated that she supports decriminalization of marijuana (moving from schedule 1 to presumably a lower schedule). This means if someone is caught with small personal amounts it would presumably be a fine instead of an arrest. She supports increasing funding for drug treatment programs; rather than building more prisons. If a doctor says that a patient can benefit from marijuana, she supports we listen to the doctor rather than listening to the police.[17]
Brown has received some of her strongest support from religious leaders, organized labor and the sugar industry.[4][18][19]
Key votes that Brown has made recently include HB 822 National Right To Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 on November 16, 2011 for which she voted against,[20] HR 358, Prohibiting Taxpayer Funding for Abortion, for which she voted against, and HJ Res 68 Authorizing Limited Use of U.S. Armed Forces in Libya for which she was also in favor of.
In 2003-2005, Brown cosponsored legislation regarding civil rights and foreign relations. She also participated in Michael Moore's ""Slacker"" college voter drive tour.
In terms of interest group ratings, Brown holds high percentages in pro-choice groups such as the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates - Positions on Reproductive Rights (for which she has a 100% rating), NARAL Pro-Choice America  Positions (100% ), National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association - House of Representatives Score (100% ). Brown overall holds high percentage rates from other issue groups involving animal and wildlife issues, senior and security issues, labor, education, and welfare and poverty. Meanwhile, Brown's ratings are lower in issues that deal with agriculture and economics such as National Taxpayers Union - Positions on Tax and Spending (5%), American Farm Bureau Federation  Positions (33%), and United States Chamber of Commerce  Positions (13%). Other relatively low rates for Brown from interest groups include trade, conservative issues, national security, indigenous peoples issues, gun issues, immigration, and foreign aid and policy issues. The ratings don't necessary correlate with Brown's positions or votes on certain issues during her time as a representative in the House.[21]
In 1998, Brown was questioned by the House Ethics Committee about receiving a $10,000 check from National Baptist Convention leader, and long-time associate, Henry Lyons.[4] Brown confirmed receiving the check and denied she had used the money improperly.[4] Brown said that she had taken the check and converted it into another check made out to Pameron Bus Tours to pay for transportation to a rally she organized in Tallahassee. She said that she didn't have to report the money, and that she had been cleared, explaining the rally was to protest the reorganization of her district lines, and she did not use it for herself.[4]
The Federal Election Commission admonished Brown and Brown's former campaign treasurer quit after he discovered that his name had been forged on her campaign reports. The staffer alleged to have forged the treasurer's signature stayed with Brown and as of 1998 was her chief of staff.[18]
On June 9, 1998, the Congressional Accountability Project voted to conduct a formal inquiry regarding Brown. The Project called for the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to determine if Brown had violated House Rule 10.[22] One of the complaints was that Brown's adult daughter, Shantrel Brown, had received a luxury automobile as a gift from an agent of a Gambian millionaire named Foutanga Sissoko. Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman Brown, had been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. Brown had worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to deport Sissoko back to his homeland as an alternative to continued incarceration. The Project held this violated the House gift rule, but Brown denied she had acted improperly. The congressional subcommittee investigating Brown found insufficient evidence to issue a Statement of Alleged Violation, but said she had acted with poor judgment in connection with Sissoko.[4][23][24]
On February 25, 2004 Brown referred to the Bush administration policies on Haiti as ""racist"", and called his representatives as a ""bunch of white men"" during a briefing on the Haiti crisis with senior State Department officials and several members of Congress.[25] Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega, said that, as a Mexican American, he deeply resented ""being called a racist and branded a white man,"" to which Brown replied, ""you all look alike to me."" Brown initially refused to consider apologizing, but later issued a statement saying, ""I sincerely did not mean to offend Secretary Noriega or anyone in the room. Rather, my comments, as they relate to 'white men,' were aimed at the policies of the Bush administration as they pertain to Haiti, which I do consider to be racist,"" she said. ""However people read it, it wasn't meant that way,"" she said, noting that she was personally insulted by the ""anti-Haiti sentiment brought to the table"" by the officials in attendance. Hispanic representatives in Florida were more ambivalent than scornful, with Mike Cordero of the Hispanic Organization of North Florida saying, ""We're not taking this as Mrs. Brown is necessarily against us. She just took a poetic license. To us, it doesn't hold any charge. It's kind of funny.""[26][27]
In July 2004 Brown was rebuked by the House of Representatives after she referred to the disputed 2000 presidential election in Florida as a ""coup d'tat"". This comment came during floor debate over HR-4818, which would have provided for international monitoring of the 2004 U.S. presidential election.[28]
In June 2007, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released a report listing Brown's daughter Shantrel Brown-Fields as a congressional lobbyist; the organization maintains that Congressional relatives working as lobbyists for special interests are a conflict of interest for lawmakers. Brown-Fields is employed by Alcalde & Fayte, with clients including ITERA, Miami-Dade County Commission, and Edward Waters College. In 2006, Brown's campaign committee paid her daughter's husband, Tyree Fields, $5,500 for political consulting work. Rep. Brown has earmarked millions of dollars in federal funding for her daughter's client Edward Waters College.[29] In 2010, she again received criticism for requesting earmarks for an organization her daughter lobbies for.[30]
During her 20092010 campaign, Corrine Brown raised up to $966,669 from fundraising. Browns top contributors included CSX Corporation, a freight transportation company with its headquarters in Jacksonville, FL, Carnival Corp., Picerne Real Estate Group, Union Pacific Corp and Berkshire Hathaway. Browns top industry contributors included those railroads, lawyers/farm firms, real estate, transportation unions, and sea transportation.[31] Top sectors in Brown's 2009-2010 campaign include Transportation, Lawyers & Lobbyists, Labor, Construction, Finance/Insurance/Real Estate. During her campaigning, the largest source of funds was given by large individual companies, which accounted for 54% of the contributions, and PAC contributions, which accounted for 36%. Sources of funds also included small individual contributions, self-financing on Brown's part and other sources.

He is a member of the Republican Party.


DeSantis was born in 1978 in Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from Dunedin High School in Dunedin in 1997. He matriculated at Yale University, where he was captain of the varsity baseball team in his senior year. He was also a member of the Phi chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Yale University, the same fraternity as 5 former U.S Presidents including George W. Bush. He graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in History in 2001. He earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School cum laude in 2005.[2]
Ron DeSantis was sworn into the Judge Advocate General Corps of the U.S. Navy at the US Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas in 2004 while still a student at the Harvard Law School, completing U.S. Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders from Trial Service Office Command South East at the Naval Station Mayport, Florida as a military prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted to Lieutenant (O-3). He worked for the Joint Task Force-Guantanamo Commander (JTF-GTMO), working directly with incarcerated terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility.
In 2007, Lt. DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.
He returned to CONUS in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Legal Service. He earned an appointment with the U.S. Department of Justice to serve as a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Middle District of Florida. Lt. DeSantis was assigned as a Trial Defense Counsel until his Honorable Discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a Reserve commission as a Lieutenant, Judge Advocate General Corps, in the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.[3]
He has authored a book entitled Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama, which was published in 2011. He has also been teaching U.S. Military Law at Florida Coastal School of Law in Jacksonville. His writing has appeared in National Review Online, Washington Times, American Spectator, Human Events, and American Thinker.
After redistricting, he decided to run in the open Florida's 6th congressional district. He has been endorsed by former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton, U.S. Senator Mike Lee, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Club for Growth, blogger Erick Erickson, businessman Donald Trump, and former U.S. Congressman Adam Putnam.[4] He won the six-candidate Republican primary with 39% of the vote. The runner-up, State Representative Fred Costello, obtained 23% of the vote, 16 points behind DeSantis.[5][6]
The 6th district was Republican leaning. In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain would be projected to have won the newly redrawn 6th district with 53% of the vote. In 2010, Rick Scott is projected to have won the CD with 54% of the vote.[7] In the November general election, DeSantis defeated Democrat Heather Beaven 57%-43%, winning all four counties.[8]
On January 29, 2014, DeSantis introduced into the House the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason.[9][10] In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.[11] DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that ""President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why.""[11]
In 2013 DeSantis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[12]
He is married to Casey Black DeSantis since 2010. Casey is a local Emmy-winning television host of the magazine style talk show out of Jacksonville, First Coast Living. They live in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
Congressman DeSantis recently spoke at a Ripon Society forum and addressed the 2013 IRS scandal and tax reform. DeSantis echoed his colleagues on understanding the main part of government. ""Part of having a constitutional government is that you have an accountable government"", he stated. He went on to say that he ""think(s) we make a huge mistake if we try to generate political outcomes, thinking that it will help us politically or that were trying to bring somebody down. I think its necessary if we are just trying to find the truth and hold individuals accountable. I think we need to see more of that in this government.""[13]"

Mica received a degree in education and was a member of Delta Chi Fraternity and Florida Blue Key while attending UF. Mica had been a businessman, serving in capacities in the real estate, telecommunications, government affairs, and consulting fields.
Mica was a member of the Florida House of Representatives for two terms from 1976 to 1980. There he served on several committees and was a leading Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. He was a staff member for Senator Paula F. Hawkins from 1981 to 1985, rising to become her chief of staff. After returning to private industry, he ran for Congress in 1992.[1]
After redistricting, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Sam M. Gibbons decided to run in the newly redrawn Florida's 11th congressional district. Mica ran and won the Republican primary with 53% of the vote, defeating State Representative Richard Graham (34%) and Vaughn Forrest (13%).[2] In the general election, he defeated Democrat Dan Webster 56%-44%.[3]
During this time period, he won re-election every two years with at least 60% of the vote.[1]
Despite the huge gains made by Democrats during the 2006 elections, Mica's seat remained safe. Jack Chagnon, a former teacher and Marine officer, launched a tough campaign, but was unable to unseat the conservative incumbent in this heavily Republican district. Mica's base salary in Congress is $165,000. His financial disclosure sheet for 2005 showed assets of between $2.6 and $4.7 million, additional income between $37,000 and $130,000. Mica defeated Chagnon 63%-37%.[4]
Mica defeated Democratic candidate Faye Armitage 62%-38%.[5]
Mica defeated Democratic nominee Heather Beaven 69%-31%.[6]
In February 2012, he announced he would run in the newly redrawn 7th district. For the first time since 1992, he will be challenged in the Republican primary.[7] Sandy Adams, current one term U.S. Congresswoman and four term State Representative, has filed to challenge Mica. Adams currently represents 51% of the district, while Mica represents 42% of the district.[8] On August 14, 2012, election day, Mica defeated Adams 61%-39%.
In the 2012 election Micas total amount of money raised was $1,953,992.20, while he ended up spending $2,124,853.81 in his campaign. Representative Micas top contributing groups to his run for office were CSX Corporation, HNTB Holdings, and the FedEx Corporation. Overall his top industry contributors were Air Transport, and Construction Services. His spending left him with no debt and $381,221 cash-on-hand.[9]
In the general election, Mica defeated Democrat Jason Kendall 59%-41%.[10]
Mica also lists himself as a strong supporter of military issues.[citation needed] The Orlando Sentinel named Mica the 4th most powerful person in Central Florida.[11]
Representative Micas political positions in areas such as abortion, gun control, health care, immigration, business and consumers, and National Security have stayed consistently conservative and are therefore rated very highly by interest groups that support Republicans. Some examples of these groups are the National Rifle Association, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, American Security Council Foundation, and the National Right to Life Committee, as well as many others. On the opposing side of these positions are some Democratic-leaning interest groups, who rate John Mica as very low in areas such as abortion, sexual orientation and gay marriage rights, civil liberties and civil rights, and protecting the environment. Some of the interest groups that have given these lower ratings are Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, American Civil Liberties Union, Environment America, Human Rights Campaign, and more. Representative Mica's views have stayed consistent in these and many other areas. One example of an area in which he has changed his ratings is the support of Arts and Humanities. His Americans for the Arts Action Fund ratings increased from 20% and 65% from 2000 to 2008 and then to 100% in 2011.[12]
As chairman of the House Oversight Committee's subcommittee on government operations, Mica has convened hearings on marijuana in every month of 2014 except April, earning him the title of ""one of the most obsessive drug warriors in Congress,"" by Marijuana Majority. [13]
Representative Micas view on abortion is pro-life except in the case of rape, incest or life of the mother. This position has gained him high ratings from Republican interest groups such as the National Right to Life Committee, and very low ratings from Democratic ones such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.[12][14]
Mica believes that balancing the budget is, and should be, a priority of Congress. He however does not agree with the majority of his party that Medicare and Medicaid spending should be reduced.[14] The Conservative interest group ratings on Micas budget goals and position range from 86 to 90%, while the Liberal interest group ratings reward Mica with an average of 10%.[12]
Mica has gained a reputation for being a strong supporter of Amtrak privatization.[15] In 2009, Mica earmarked $13 million for the Central Commuter Rail, a major initiative supported by one of Mica's daughter's clients.[16][17]
Mica is married to Patricia, a school teacher, and has two grown children. He lives in Winter Park, Florida. He is the brother of former Representative Daniel A. Mica, while his other brother, David is a former ranking staffer of Senator Lawton Chiles. He is a member of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, and the Coast Guard Academy Board of Visitors.[citation needed]"

""Bill"" Posey[1] (born December 18, 1947) is the U.S. Representative for Florida's 8th congressional district, serving in Congress since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. He formerly served in the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives.


Posey was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Beatrice (ne Tohl) and Walter J. Posey. His mother's family immigrated from Russia and is of Jewish heritage.[2] Posey moved to Florida in 1956, as his father took a job in engineering with NASA. In 1969, he graduated from Brevard Community College with an Associate of Arts degree.
He obtained his own work at NASA,[clarification needed] but was laid off at the end of the Apollo Space Program. From 1974 to 1976, Bill Posey worked on the Rockledge Planning Commission. In 1976, he was elected as a member of the City Council, and from 1986 to 1992, he was a member of the Brevard County Business and Industrial Development Commission. Posey then founded his own real estate company in the 1970s. He later became director of the state Association of Realtors. While serving in local politics, he also became a researcher on government accountability and transparency.
In 2006, Posey authored Activity Based Total Accountability, which outlines his suggestions for improving American politics.
While serving in the state legislature, Posey was a chief sponsor of a bill designed to modernize the Florida election process, in response to the 2000 presidential election controversy. He also worked to revise insurance policy, so as to aid hurricane victims.[3]
In 2008, Posey ran to replace retiring U.S. Congressman Dave Weldon, who had occupied the 15th District seat since 1995, when the district first voted Republican. He was opposed by Democrat Stephen Blythe, and the independent, libertarian leaning Frank Zilaitis. Posey won with 53% of the vote, defeating his closest challenger, Blythe, by 11%.[4]
Posey won re-election against former NASA executive and public administrator Shannon Roberts.
Posey won re-election with nearly 60% of the vote against Democratic nominee Shannon Roberts and non-partisan candidate Richard Gillmor.[5]
Bill Posey is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[6]
On March 12, 2009, Posey introduced into the United States House of Representatives H.R. 1503.[7] Posey claims that the bill, which would require future presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate, is a reaction to claims that President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen.[8][9] Critics, including the editorial board of The Orlando Sentinel, have claimed that the bill further perpetuates the theories.
When asked whether or not he believed Obama to be a natural born citizen, Posey remarked that his beliefs on the matter were irrelevant.[10] Posey's bill gained the support of 12 Republican co-sponsors.[11][12]"

He previously served as Representative for Florida's 8th congressional district from 2009 to 2011. He was defeated for re-election in 2010 by Republican Daniel Webster[3] and was then elected in 2012 for a second, non-consecutive term in the House of Representatives, defeating Republican Todd Long.[4] In 2014 he defeated Republican challenger Carol Platt to win re-election.[5]


Grayson was born in the Bronx, New York City, New York, to Dorothy Ann (ne Sabin) and Daniel Franklin Grayson.[6][7] He graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1975. Grayson worked his way through Harvard College as a janitor and nightwatchman, and graduated with a Bachelors of Arts summa cum laude degree in economics in 1978.[8][9] After working two years as an economist, he returned to Harvard for graduate studies.[2] In 1983, he earned a Juris Doctor magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and a Masters of Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Additionally, he completed some of the requirements for a PhD in governmentthe course work and passing the general exams.[8][10] While in college Grayson was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.
Grayson wrote his masters thesis on gerontology and in 1986, he helped found the non-profit Alliance for Aging Research in Washington, D.C., and served as an officer of the organization for more than twenty years.[11]
Grayson worked as a law clerk at the Colorado Supreme Court in 1983,[12] and at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals from 1984 to 1985, where he worked with two judges who later joined the U.S. Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia.[2] He was an associate at the Washington, D.C. firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson for five years, where he specialized in contract law.
In 1991 he founded the law firm Grayson & Kubli, which concentrated on government contract law. He was a lecturer at the George Washington University government contracts program and a frequent speaker on the topic.[10] In the 2000s, he worked as a plaintiffs' attorney specializing in whistleblower fraud cases aimed at Iraq war contractors. One contractor, Custer Battles, employed individuals who were found guilty of making fraudulent statements and submitting fraudulent invoices on two contracts the company had with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.[13][14] On behalf of his clients, Grayson filed suit under the False Claims Act and its qui tam provisions.[13] The jury verdict was more than $13 million, which was upheld on appeal in April 2009. The case remains the only successful prosecution of those who profited illegally from the war in Iraq. The Iraq war contractor fraud case brought Grayson his first national attention.[15] In 2006, a Wall Street Journal reporter described Grayson as ""waging a one-man war against contractor fraud in Iraq"" and as a ""fierce critic of the war in Iraq"" whose car displayed bumper stickers such as ""Bush lied, people died"".[16]
Grayson made his fortune as the co-founder and first president of IDT Corporation (International Discount Telecom).[11][17][18]
In 2006, Grayson first entered into electoral politics, losing the 2006 Democratic primary for Florida's 8th congressional district to Charlie Stuart, a prominent local businessman and conservative Democrat.[19] Stuart went on to lose the general election to incumbent Republican Ric Keller.[20]
In late 2007, Grayson announced that he would run again for the 8th district seat, and again faced Stuart in the primary. In the August 26, 2008 Democratic primary, Grayson defeated Stuart 49%-28%, with three other candidates splitting the remaining 24%.[21] During the general election campaign, Grayson maintained a consistent lead over Keller, who had only slightly won renomination in the Republican primary over attorney Todd Long. On election day, Grayson defeated Keller, 52%-48%.[22]
Grayson was challenged by Republican nominee Daniel Webster, Florida Tea Party backed Peg Dunmire, Independent George Metcalfe, and write-in Florida Whig Party candidate Steve Gerritzen.[23]
Grayson ran a September 2010, commercial calling Webster a ""draft-dodger""[24] (Webster had received student deferments and a draft classification as medically unfit for service),[25] and a later 30-second commercial calling Webster ""Taliban Dan"" and warning viewers that ""Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom, in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.""[26] Grayson's ads were criticized for editing video mid-sentence to make Webster appear to be saying things he did not.[27][28] Grayson released a toned-down version without the edited video or Taliban references in early October.[29][30]
On Glenn Beck's radio show, Sarah Palin agreed with a co-host's remark, ""It's okay if the Republicans lose every seat in the Senate and the House except for one. As long as that one is Alan Grayson losing.""[31] Conservative Newsweek columnist George Will called Grayson ""America's worst politician.""[32][33] Grayson was also heavily targeted in attack ads funded by groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the 60 Plus Association.[34]
Grayson was endorsed by 8th district resident, former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), who characterized Webster as having ""13th-century views"" on women's issues.[35] Former DNC Chair and Vermont governor Howard Dean called Grayson a ""healthcare hero.""[36] Grayson received more votes for ""progressive hero"" from Democracy for America than any other candidate in the country.[37]
On election day, Webster defeated Grayson 56%-38%.[38][39]
On July 11, 2011, Grayson announced in an e-mail to supporters that he planned to run once again for Congress.[40] Grayson ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for the newly created 9th District in Central Florida.[41]
On November 6, 2012, Grayson defeated Todd Long 63%-37% to return to Congress after a one-term absence. He described his victory as ""the biggest comeback in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives.""[42] Although the two districts had different boundaries, Grayson claimed the House historian had told him that the shift from a 56%-38% loss in 2010 to a 63%-37% victory in 2012 was the biggest comeback in congressional history.[43]
Grayson was the second Democrat to represent Florida's 8th congressional district since its formation after the 1970 census (it was the 5th District from 1973 to 1993 and has been the 8th since 1993). The only other Democrat to represent this district, Bill Gunter, left to run for the United States Senate in 1974 after only one term.
Grayson is considered a progressive Democrat. He supported Barack Obama in 2008. He was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which he was vice-chairman.[44] Grayson twice joined Republicans to oppose the raising of the federal debt limit. He said, ""We need to live within our means. We need to eliminate wasteful spending. If we did those two simple things, we would not need to raise the debt limit.""[45]
On September 14, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.RES 686, Grayson's ""Teach the Constitution Week"" bill. The bill urged high schools to spend one week each September teaching the United States Constitution to high school seniors and also encouraged students to petition the government on an issue of personal importance to them to demonstrate their understanding of their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States. The non-partisan resolution was passed by a voice vote and featured 222 co-sponsors.[46][47][48]
On the 40th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Grayson's ""New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009"". The bill asked the president to present Congress's highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins, as well as John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. Only about 200 medals have ever been awarded in the country's history. The New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009 passed the House unanimously on July 20, 2009.[49][50]
Best known in his first term for making incendiary comments about Republicans, Grayson has focused on working with Republicans to pass amendments that ""appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP"". He lobbies colleagues personally and in July 2013, David Weigel of Slate magazine called him ""the most effective member of the House"" and said that he was approaching ""an unheralded title: The congressman whos passed more amendments than any of his 434 peers"".[51]
In October 2013, his campaign sent out a fundraising email that compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan. It used the image of a burning cross as the ""T"" in Tea Party. Matt Gorman of the National Republican Congressional Committee described the e-mail as ""hateful words and imagery"". Grayson defended the comparison, saying that ""here is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.""[52]
During his first term in office, Grayson supported Ron Paul's Audit the Fed legislation.[53] Grayson gained attention for exchanges with Federal Reserve System Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and Inspector General Elizabeth A. Coleman.[54] The 5-minute examination of Coleman in the House Financial Services Committee was posted on Grayson's official YouTube page, and as of December 2010, it has been viewed more than 4 million times.[55]
On a September 2009 Alex Jones Show segment, Grayson criticized Federal Reserve Chair Bernanke's senior adviser Linda Robertson, saying ""Here I am the only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, this lobbyist, this K-Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics!""[56][57] Robertson had previously worked as a lobbyist for Enron.[58] Grayson's language was widely criticized as inappropriate,[59] and Grayson apologized.[58]
Following the AIG bonus payments controversy, Grayson joined fellow freshman Democrat Jim Himes of Connecticut to introduce the Grayson-Himes Pay for Performance Act, legislation to require that all bonuses paid by companies that had received funds under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 be ""based on performance"".[60] The bill was co-sponsored by eight other members of the House. On March 26, the bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 3822 and on April 1, the bill was passed by the full House of Representatives by a vote of 247171.[61]
Grayson was a co-sponsor of the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, which would provide additional provisions to audit the Federal Reserve, including removing several key exemptions.[62]
Grayson made it a priority to increase the amount of federal money returning to his district. He often said that people in his district had been ""exporting taxes and importing debt."" During his first year in office, the amount of federal grant dollars returning to the district nearly doubled with a 98% increase.[63][64] Grayson established a grant notification system that notifies subscribers immediately when a federal grant opportunity in their areas of interest becomes available. He also hired a full-time grants coordinator who focused solely on helping people navigate the federal grants process.
Grayson supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and has been outspoken in favor of extending unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their jobs. Grayson argues that the government has never cut off unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate was higher than eight percent. Grayson also voted for FDA oversight of tobacco products, which would give the FDA power to regulate tobacco.
Grayson has worked to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of The New York Times, columnist Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top executives at the institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.[65]
In September 2009, Grayson used a parliamentary maneuver called an ""extension of remarks"" to provide crucial instruction on H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, a bill that, among other things, included a provision that prohibited funding for ACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). Grayson's extension of remarks directed that the legislation defund any organization that cheats the federal government, not just ACORN. The defunding measure passed the House with a final vote of 253171.[66] Grayson also encouraged the public to report companies covered by the bill and set up a method to report offending companies via his Congressional website.[67]
In response to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred health care bill was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the Public Option Act (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a short four-page bill which would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States to buy into the public Medicare program at cost.[68] The bill attracted 82 co-sponsors and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee.
Grayson later voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act[69] and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[70] He voted in support of eliminating adjustments of Medicare rates of payment. He also voted against Republican substitutes for the health care amendment and insurance law amendments.[71]
On September 29, 2009 in a late-night speech on the House floor, Grayson presented his impression of the Republican's heath plan, illustrated by signs. He said the Republican health plan was ""don't get sick"", and ""if you do get sick, die quickly"".[72] After demands from Republicans that he apologize, he defended his comment and in a House Floor speech stated,""I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.""[73] He was then further lambasted for his use of the word holocaust by Jewish spokespersons across the nation. Grayson, who is Jewish, apologized to the Anti-defamation League for those offended by his generic use of holocaust.[74][75][76] He also maintained that Congressional Republicans failed to offer a feasible plan.[77][78] In October 2009 he launched www.NamesOfTheDead.com, a website to ""memorialize Americans who die because they don't have health insurance."" He subsequently read stories of the dead submitted through the Names of the Dead site on the House floor.[79]
Grayson is pro-choice and supports increased funding for stem cell research.[80] He has always supported same-sex marriage and said in an interviews in 2013, ""the propaganda that somehow gay marriage makes straight marriage bad for everyone is just farcical to me. I just dont understand the logic of it.""[81]
Grayson voted in support of the Hate Crimes Expansion Act, which expands the definition of hate crimes and strengthens enforcement of hate crime laws. He also voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Grayson supported the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that allows victims of wage discrimination to sue for punitive damages.[71]
Grayson voted for the House's 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). The bill would provide for a $50 million ""Hurricane Research Center"" in Central Florida, and Grayson claimed it would immediately generate new jobs.[82] Grayson noted after the passage of the ACES Act his concern about our dependence on foreign oil, the need to promote green technologies, renewable energy sources, and the job creation from the bill (an estimated 95,000 jobs in Florida). ""This bill unleashes American ingenuity to solve the energy crisis. It lets us solve our problems by being Americans and thinking our way out of it. We will become an international energy power,"" he said in a news release.
The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico affected Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf each week.[83] In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled at the same time as any new exploratory well.
Grayson has been an outspoken critic of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In May 2010, he introduced the War Is Making You Poor Act. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The bill does not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion.[84]
Grayson has tried to combat wasteful spending by government defense contractors by introducing his ""Gold Plating Amendment"". The amendment would require that cost or price account for half of the evaluation of bids for defense contracts. The law at the time allowed for cost to account for only 1% of the evaluation. The amendment passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in June 2009. However, the language was stripped from the final bill during the conference committee between Senate and House leaders. Grayson worked successfully to get the amendment inserted into H.R.5013, the IMPROVE Acquisition Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on April 28, 2010.[85]
Grayson has been an outspoken opponent of plans for the United States to intervene in the Syrian civil war.[86] He has rejected what he calls ""warmongering"",[87] saying: ""It's simply not our responsibility. We're not the world's policeman."" Instead, he called for a focus on humanitarian efforts and solving domestic problems.[88] He launched www.DontAttackSyria.com, where he began gathering signatures for his petition calling on Congress to vote against authorizing military action against Syria, and has been ""whipping votes"" in the House of Representatives.[89]
While pursuing the whistleblower cases, Grayson worked from a home office in Orlando, where he lived with his wife and five children.[15]
Grayson was ranked as the 11th-wealthiest member of Congress in 2010, based on financial disclosure forms with a net worth of $31.41 million, and a pending claim against the now-defunct Derivium Capital for at least $25 million, according to Roll Call.[90] Grayson disclosed that his attorney fees and costs for the war contractor case had exceeded $4 million.[14][16]
Grayson married Lolita Grayson in 1990 and has five children.[91][92] The couple separated in March 2014.[93] In March 2015, Grayson asked a court in Orlando to annul the marriage.[94]"
"96","","2011","1949","Florida 10","Georgia Institute of Technology","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster_(Florida_politician)","Daniel Webster","Republican","Florida Senate, Florida House of Representatives","Baptist - SBC","Daniel Alan ""Dan"" Webster (born April 27, 1949) is an American politician who has been a member of the United States House of Representatives since 2011. Webster, a Republican from Florida, initially represented Florida's 8th congressional district; since 2013, his district has been numbered the 10th district, located in the central part of the state.[1] Previously, Webster served 28 years in the Florida state legislature.
After receiving his engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, he worked in the family air conditioning and heating business that he now owns and operates. He has been a resident of Florida since the age of seven and resides in Winter Garden, Florida.
First elected in 1980, Webster served 28 years in the state legislature in Tallahassee, becoming the longest serving legislator in Florida history.[2] During that time, he rose to become Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate majority leader,[3] and left the legislature only after reaching the legal term limits in 2008.[4] He ran unopposed in all of his elections for the state legislature except for the first three; 1980, 1982, and 1984.[5]
Webster was first elected to Congress in 2010. In November 2012, Webster defeated Val Demings, the former Chief of Police of the Orlando Police Department, to secure re-election.


Webster was born in Charleston, West Virginia and raised in Orlando, Florida where his family moved when Webster was seven, upon a doctor's recommendation that a change of climate might cure Webster's sinus problems.[6] He is a distant relative of the antebellum politician and orator Daniel Webster.[5]
He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was student government chaplain from 1970 to 1971 and a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[6][7] He graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.[7] Upon graduation, Webster's Vietnam war era student deferment expired and he became eligible for conscription into the U.S. military. He was not drafted, however, because he failed the physical exam due to lifelong foot problems which prevent him from standing for long periods of time.[8]
Since college Webster has worked in the family air conditioning and heating business; he presently owns and operates it.[6][9] Webster lives in Winter Garden, Florida.[10]
Webster first decided to run for the Florida House in 1979 at the age of 30. He had been working on a project with his church to convert a residential house into a place for Sunday school to be conducted. When the Orange County commissioners rejected the church's request for a zoning exception, Webster investigated and found that the county commission had rejected every zoning exemption request brought before them by a church or religious organization. Seeking to rectify what he thought an injustice, Webster decided to run for public office after finding no politician who shared his displeasure with local and statewide government.[6]
In the Republican primary, Webster ranked first with 38%, but failed to obtain the 50% threshold necessary to avoid a run-off election.[11] In the run-off, he defeated Barbara Owens 54%-46%.[12] In the general election, he defeated Democrat State Representative Henry Swanson 51%-49%, a difference of just 2,070 votes.[13] The race came down to one precinct, Webster's own Pine Hills, which he won.[5]
After redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn Florida's 41st House District. He won re-election to a second term by defeating Craig Crawford 58%-42%.[14] In 1984, he won re-election to a third term against State Representative Dick Batchelor, 54%-46%.[15][16]
After defeating Batchelor in 1984, he never had another election opponent in the State House of Representatives as he won re-election unopposed each two years thereafter.
Webster was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1980. There, he served as Minority Floor Leader, and then Minority Whip. In 1996, when the Republicans gained a majority in the House, Webster became the first Republican Speaker of the Florida House in 122 years. He remained Speaker until 1998 when term limits made him ineligible to run for re-election to the state House.[9][17]
During his tenure as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Webster received recognition and awards from a number of organizations, including the American Heart Association for support of AHA priority issues (1996), the Board of Regents Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Association of State Troopers Leadership Award for Excellence in Legislative Leadership (1996), the Florida Banking Association Award (1995), the Florida Chamber of Commerce Legislator of the Year (1995), the Florida Farm Bureau Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Hotel and Motel Association Special Recognition Award (1995), the Florida League of Cities Quality Floridian (1995), the Florida Medical Association recognition award (1996), and the Republican Party of Florida Statesman of the Year award (1995).[7]
Webster's first bill to become law was the 1985 Home Education Program Act which legalized homeschooling in Florida. He considers it his most significant legislation.[5] He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate,[5] and a member of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the Institute in Basic Life Principles.[18] While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance the needs of all school districts and not raise any new taxes.[19] He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes.[19][20][21] He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who would be homeschooling their children.[22]
In 1990, Webster sponsored and supported legislation in Florida introducing the policy of covenant marriage. This would make divorce between even two consenting individuals much harder, except in cases of infidelity.[23]
He ran unopposed for the Florida Senate in Florida's 12th and 9th Senate Districts. He served until reaching the term limit in 2008.
In 2002, he unsuccessfully tried for the position of Senate President.[25][26] From 2006 to 2008, he served as Senate Majority Leader. In 2006, while Majority Leader of the Florida Senate, he received the Florida Family Council Award (2006).[5]
The Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike District Headquarters was named the ""Senator Daniel Webster Building"" in 2008 and in 2005 State Road 429 was designated the ""Daniel Webster Western Beltway"".[5] In addition, the largest committee room in the Florida House was named ""Speaker Daniel Webster Hall"" in his honor in 2008.[5]
In 2007, Webster attached an amendment to a bill for steroid testing of high school athletes that would have created an oversight body for private school athletes separate from the Florida High School Athletic Association.[27] He said the provision was in response to complaints from private schools that had been allegedly singled out for recruiting violations.[27]
In 2008 Webster sponsored SB 2400 in the Florida Senate requiring that all women planning to undergo an abortion receive an ultrasound, but giving them a choice of whether to see the live images of the fetus.[28][29] He argued that it would give women more medical information prior to receiving an abortion, and said if that changed some women's minds, it would make him happy.[28][29] Opponents said the measure would be an invasion of privacy.[28] The bill did not pass the Senate at that time, but later became law.[29][30] He also sponsored a law that would have required minors to notify their legal guardians before receiving an abortion.[5] It has been alleged that Webster does not believe in the right to have an abortion following rape or incest. When questioned by a reporter on the topic, Webster declines to comment.[31] He eventually stated that this was an issue being used to distract from his real issue which was that ""Washington is broken."" [32]
Webster was a central figure in the Terri Schiavo case which involved a dispute between relatives on whether to remove the feeding tube of an unconscious woman who had been in a persistent vegetative state for years. In March 2005, he introduced SB 804 that would have prohibited such patients from being denied food and water if family members disagreed on the patient's wishes and if the patient had not expressed his wishes in writing when competent.[33] The bill failed to pass the Senate by three votes.[33][34][35]
He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee.[2]
Webster rejected early suggestions by several leaders in the Republican Party of Florida that he run to represent Florida's 8th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, but in April 2010, he changed his mind and entered the race.[36] Webster's name recognition and an endorsement from former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush quickly turned him into the race front-runner.[37] He was further aided by a late endorsement and campaign rally from former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.[38] On August 24, 2010, Webster defeated six other candidates in the Republican primary winning nomination with forty percent of the vote, while the runner-up received twenty-three percent.[39] Webster was named one of fifty-two ""Young Guns"" of the National Republican Congressional Committee's Young Guns Program, those the Republican Party viewed as serious contenders in their races.[40]
The campaign featured ads by opponent Grayson that criticized Webster's conservative religious views on marriage and abortion as well as attack ads against Grayson that were financed by Americans for Prosperity and the 60 Plus Association.[32]
In July of 2010, Webster signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to ""oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.""[41]
On November 2, 2010, Webster won the seat by a 56% to 38% margin.[42] Three other candidates were on the ballot: Independent George Metcalfe, Florida Whig Party candidate Steve Gerritzen, and Peg Dunmire of the Florida TEA Party.[43][44]
Webster defeated Val Demings, the former Chief of Police of the Orlando Police Department, by a 51.7% to 48.3% margin to secure re-election.
Webster's main platform in the 2010 election was a call for smaller, streamlined government, spending cuts, budget roll backs, and tax cuts. He also said he will increase the protection of personal rights and encourage financial responsibility in the federal government.[36][45] Webster predicted that if Republicans took back Congress in November, ""we would have the opportunity for turning this country around."" In the 2015 vote for Speaker of the House, Webster received the second most Republican votes.[46]
Webster briefly ran for the United States Senate in 2004 when he attempted to collect the 93,000 signatures necessary to place his name on the ballot without paying the filing fee. Webster claimed that he sought to be the first Senate candidate to ever qualify using this method as both a symbolic gesture and a way to build an early network of voters.[48] Webster eventually qualified by paying the fee instead, and later dropped out of the race.[49]
When Mel Martinez resigned from the United States Senate, it fell upon Governor Charlie Crist to name a replacement to finish out his Senate term. Webster was floated early on as one of seven potential candidates for the position.[9][50] In the end, George LeMieux was selected for the position.[51]
Webster is a Southern Baptist and attends First Baptist Church of Central Florida.[52] He is on the University of Central Florida board of trustees.[53] He and his wife Sandy have six grown children. As of 2010, they had five grandchildren.[5]
The Websters home-schooled their children using the curriculum of the Advanced Training Institute, which was founded by Bill Gothard.
In May 2014, their son, John married Alyssa Bates, daughter of Gil and Kelly Bates. The Bates family stars in the reality show Bringing Up Bates and have been recurring guests on the show 19 Kids and Counting, which depicts the lives of their friends, Jim Bob Duggar and his wife Michelle."

Congressman Nugent claims to be committed to fighting against what he terms out of control spending presently happening in Washington. He opposed the $700 billion bailout by President Bush, a temporaty fix for de-regulation of the banking and finance industries, two unfunded Bush era wars, and a decades-long wage decrease. He also opposed the Obama Administration's $862 billion stimulus package, which was an attempt by President Obama to bolster a damaged economy.
Nugent has pledged to fight to reduce spending in Washington. He also believes that parts of government spending (including the Health Care Law) are unconstitutional. He claims that his main reason for opposing continued deficit spending is simply that American families just cannot afford it anymore. Nugent claims to believe that each American family's share of the national debt already stands at $118,000 and asks the question ""what happens to these families when the federal government's bill comes due? He has signed on as a co-sponsor to both balanced budget amendments offered by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA).[22]
Nugent signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 25, better known as ""The Fair Tax"". This legislation introduced by Rep. Rob Woodall (R-GA) would abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), repeal the federal income tax, and replace it with a transparent tax on consumption.[23]
In 2010 Nugent signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[24]
Congressman Nugent opposed the passage of President Obama's health care legislation and has vowed to work for its repeal. He has stated that he is open to listening to anybody's plan to save and reform Medicare so long as benefits are completely unchanged for those 55 and up. He has stated he will ensure that Americans can keep the coverage they already have.[25] Nugent is so opposed to the Health Care Law, that he has been an outspoken supporter of a Congressional lawsuit against President Obama for delaying the implementation of a part of the law.[clarification needed]
Nugent currently serves on the Committee on House Administration[26] and the House Committee on Rules.[27]
Members of the Committee on House Administration are charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House.[28] With the 112th Congress, two subcommittees were added to the Committee's jurisdiction, the Subcommittee on Elections and the Subcommittee on Oversight.[26] The Committee on Rules was first constituted in 1789. It is commonly known as ""The Speaker's Committee"" because it is the mechanism that the Speaker uses to maintain control of the House Floor.[29]
Congressman Nugent belongs to several House caucus groups, including the Congressional Sportsman's Caucus,[30] The Constitution Caucus,[31] The Military Family Caucus,[32] and the Tea Party Caucus.

Bill Young.[1] He won the race for Young's seat as the Republican candidate in a 2014 special election against Democrat Alex Sink and Libertarian Lucas Overby.[2]


Jolly was born in Dunedin, Florida.[3] He received his Bachelor of Arts in history from Emory University and a juris doctorate from the George Mason University School of Law. He worked for U.S. Rep. Young as an adviser and General Counsel until 2007.
In 2007, Jolly began work as a lobbyist with Washington, D.C. firm Van Scoyoc Associates.

She is a member of the Democratic Party.
The district covers most of Tampa, most of south St. Petersburg, a portion of unincorporated Hillsborough County, and a small section of Temple Terrace.


Castor was born in Miami. Her mother, Betty Castor (ne Elizabeth Bowe), is a former University of South Florida President, a former Hillsborough County Commissioner, a former Florida State Senator, a former Florida Education Commissioner, and a 2004 United States Senate candidate. Her father, Donald F. ""Don"" Castor,[1] was a Hillsborough County judge and passed away in April, 2013.[2] Kathy Castor was raised in Tampa and graduated from Chamberlain High School. She holds a bachelor's degree in political science from Emory University (1988) and a J.D. from Florida State University College of Law (1991). She is a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority.
Castor began her legal career as Assistant General Counsel to the Florida Department of Community Affairs. She is the former President of the Florida Association of Women Lawyers and partner in a statewide law firm. In 2005, Castor was named as the Tampa Bay Business Journal's Woman of the Year in government.
Castor served on the Hillsborough County Board of Commissioners from 2002 through 2006. Her primary focus was on health care. She worked to stop seniors and other patients in Hillsborough Countys health care plan from being forced into HMOs.
Kathy Castor was the only Democratic member of Congress from Florida to vote against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, also known as the bailout bill, stating that: ""After thoughtful consideration and review, I voted against President Bush's $700 billion bailout. The Bush plan does not provide sufficient help to middle-class families in the housing squeeze or taxpayer protections.[3] Instead, she championed programs such as the Neighborhood Stabilization Program[4] and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and said it was the lifeline that really saved the economy.[5] In Tampa Bay, Recovery Act funds were invested in transportation, education, housing, research, law enforcement and various local infrastructure improvements.[6] The I-4/Crosstown Connector received the largest Recovery Act investment in Tampa Bay, with $105 million to make the completion of the project possible and it opened to the public in 2014.
Since her first congressional campaign in 2006, Kathy Castor has supported a withdrawal of U.S. troops out of Iraq and redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.[7] Her first committee assignment was the House Armed Services and in 2007, she stated: When you put things in perspective, were spending over $10 billion a month in Iraq. Were not going to be able to recover all that because well have to rebuild the military. Theyve put us in a terrible position. Were at such a strategic risk right now because of the years spent in Iraq. General Schoomaker testified at our committee that this escalation puts the Army at a huge risk. We will be unable to respond to any other threat to our global security.[8]
In 2007, Kathy Castor voted to redeploy U.S. troops out of Iraq.[9] In 2014, during a speech in St. Petersburg, Kathy Castor reflected on her first term in Congress, when the Iraq War was the No. 1 issue being debated. She said: What really informed my time on the House Armed Services Committee was visiting the VA hospitals here because the James A. Haley Hospital in Tampa is the busiest VA in the country, and is home to one of four polytrauma centers. My visits there, monthly, exposed me to these young heroes who had been wounded overseas and the need for us to take care of them and live up to our responsibilities [10]
Kathy Castor has called the GI Bill for the 21st Century that passed in 2008 despite strenuous opposition by President Bush one of the most important pieces of legislation that I have cosponsored.[10] The bill restored full, four-year college scholarships to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from benefits at the time that were only paying about 70 percent of a public college education and 30 percent of a private college education for returning veterans. The legislation also allowed veterans to transfer those benefits to family members.
More recently, Kathy Castor was outspoken on the cuts that the 2013 Republican sequester would create for Head Start programs and research programs at Moffitt Cancer Care and University of South Florida. In a February 2013 letter she wrote to House Speaker John Boehner, she stated: In addition to cuts to USF and Moffitt, the sequester will deal a harsh blow to students, teachers and our public schools. I fear for the students and families who rely on Head Start for readiness in their critical early learning years. As one of the largest school districts in the nation, Hillsborough County would face particularly steep cutbacks in terms of funding and would severely weaken its ability to provide students with the tools they need to be successful. Dire cuts to students and education are short-sighted.[11]
Kathy Castor has been interested in health care since her first elected position on the Hillsborough County Commission, where she defended the need to fund the countys indigent health care plan.[citation needed] In 2008, Kathy Castor successfully championed legislation to allow low-income families with overdue medical bills to still be eligible for student loans.[citation needed] Kathy Castor has served on the House Energy & Commerce Committee since 111th Congress.[12] As a member of the Health Subcommittee, she was instrumental in ensuring that health care reform worked for Florida families, businesses, and university medical and nursing colleges. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, Kathy Castor has worked tirelessly to educate neighbors about new patient protections and rights, and enrollment in the new marketplace exchange.[13] She has been critical of Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican-led Florida Legislature for not accepting more than $50 billion in federal funding to expand Medicaid to provide access health care access to more than 1 million Floridians.[14] With the assistance of the National Association of Childrens Hospitals, she and Rep. Dave Reichert of Washington founded the bipartisan Childrens Health Care Caucus, dedicated to building support for ideas that improve the quality of care for children and their access to the quality care.
The House seat in the district became open when five-term Democrat Jim Davis (D) chose to run for governor (he lost to Charlie Crist in November).
Castor won the September 5, 2006 Democratic primarythe real contest in what has long been the only safe Democratic district on Florida's Gulf Coastdefeating challengers Al Fox, Lesley ""Les"" Miller, Scott Farrell, and Michael Steinberg. She received 54% of the vote, a full 20 points ahead of state Senate Minority Leader Les Miller in the five-way race.
Eddie Adams Jr., an architect and former hospital laboratory technologist,[15] was the only Republican to file. Castor was endorsed by the pro-choice political action committee EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Oceans Champions, The Tampa Tribune, The St. Petersburg Times and The Bradenton Herald.
Castor handily won the 2006 November general election, 70% to 30%--becoming the first woman to represent Tampa and St. Petersburg in Congress, as well as only the third representative of this St. Petersburg/Tampa-based district since its creation in 1963 (it was the 10th District from 196367, the 6th from 196773, the 7th from 197393 and has been the 11th since 1993).
Castor was reelected in November 2008 71% to 29% in a rematch with Adams.
Castor was challenged by Republican nominee Mike Prendergast, a career military officer who retired in 2008 as a Colonel in the United States Army. Castor was reelected in November 2010 with 60% of the vote to Prendergast's 40%. Though Castor won convincingly, it was still the best showing for a Republican in this district since 1994.
After the 2010 census, Florida gained two more congressional seats. As a result, Castor's district was redistricted from the 11th to the 14th. It was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Castor won reelection with 70.2 percent of the vote over Republican E. J. Otero."

He is a member of the Republican Party. Rep. Buchanan is the only member from Florida on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care, and Social Security. Prior to serving in Congress, Buchanan was in business for over 30 years and was the chairman of both the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce and the Florida State Chamber of Commerce. He served as member of the board and the executive committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce.


Buchanan grew up in a small town outside Detroit Michigan, the son of a factory foreman in a family of six children.[2][3] His maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Finland.[4] When he graduated from high school in 1969, he joined the Michigan Air National Guard, serving there for six years. Buchanan got a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Cleary University, in Michigan, and a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Detroit.
In June 2007, Buchanan, in his financial disclosure filing, reported having over $100 million in assets, making him among the five wealthiest members of Congress. Most of his wealth is from his automotive empire, which includes several dealerships in Florida. He also reported ownership interests in about fifty other businesses, including offshore reinsurance companies, and a charter-jet business. He reported receiving at least $19.5 million in income from these businesses in 2006.[5]
In May 1976, Buchanan convinced the owner of a Michigan printing company that he could help the business grow. The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. In 1989, a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch made Buchanan a $15.4 million loan, guaranteed by his ownership in the company. In 1992, the company filed for bankruptcy, three days after Buchanan resigned; at the time, he owned all the company's stock.[2][6]
Buchanan and American Speedy were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After the bankruptcy, he was accused by a creditors committee of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy. In a 1995 deposition, he said that he had no personal obligation to repay the loan from Merrill Lynch; a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s and ended with him paying $1.5 million for ""excessive compensation"".[6]
In 1992, Buchanan bought a Honda and Acura dealership in Ocala, Florida. In late 1999, he bought two more dealerships. He continued to acquire dealerships after that, but in 2006 he sold five dealerships and other businesses in order to concentrate on politics.[2] His dealerships had $756 million in sales in 2005.[6] His Venice Dodge was one of the dealerships informed by Chrysler that it would not get its franchise renewed.[7]
Buchanan owns two reinsurance companies  Jamat Reinsurance Co. and Buchanan Reinsurance Co., in Turks and Caicos, and part of the Bermuda reinsurance company Greater Atlantic Insurance Co. The three companies offer extended warranty policies to car buyers. Buchanan invests some of the proceeds from his reinsurance companies in real estate developments in the Bahamas.[8]
In 1999, Buchanan was approached to help to finance the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in Sarasota. Buchanan was cut out of the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued and the parties settled in 2001.[9] Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought a condo from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit a little more than a year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million. The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million.[9] In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers.[9]
Buchanan ran in the 13th congressional district in Florida to replace incumbent Republican Katherine Harris, who was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Buchanan won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote, against four opponents. His closest challengers were Nancy C. Detert, with 25% of the vote, and Tramm Hudson, with 24%.
In the November general election, Buchanan faced Democrat Christine Jennings, a banking executive. There were 216,000 registered Republicans and about 155,000 registered Democrats in the district,[10] but Jennings polled ahead of Buchanan up to election day.[11] Buchanan put more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign.[2]
In October, Vice President Dick Cheney held a fund raising luncheon for Buchanan;[12] later that month, President Bush held a fund raising reception for him.[13] Between the two events, Governor Jeb Bush, Senator Martinez, and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney came to the district to campaign for Buchanan.[14]
Initial results of the November election showed Buchanan leading by less than 350 votes. Due to the closeness of the race, and a high undervote of 18,000 in Sarasota County, a recount was ordered. Voters in Sarasota County had given more votes to a hospital board than they had to their Congressional representativewith 13% of voters not voting, compared to an average of 2% in neighboring counties.[11] The touch-screen voting machines used provided no paper record.[11] On November 20, 2006, the Florida Department of State certified the results of the recount, which showed Buchanan winning by 369 votes.
Jennings challenged the results of the election in court, citing ""pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.""[11] In December 2006, a Florida circuit judge ruled that her claim that voting machines in Sarasota County lost up to 18,000 votes was ""conjecture"" and didn't warrant overriding the trade secrets of the voting machine company. In June 2007, a Florida state appellate court ruled that Jennings did not meet the ""extraordinary burden"" of proving the lower court judge was wrong.[15]
The U.S. House of Representatives had the right to make the final determination as to whether Buchanan will hold the seat for the remainder of the term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election.[16] In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Floridas 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).[17] On 25 February 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan.[18]
Buchanan, who won narrowly in 2006, but was easily re-elected in a 2008 rematch with Christine Jennings. He received 55% of the vote to 38% for Jennings.[19] On election night in 2008 Buchanan said, ""What a difference two years makes."" Buchanan said that he was humbled by the huge margin of victory and that he would focus his next term on ""jobs, the economy, taxes, energy prices, national security and we've got to change the broken system in Washington."" [20]
In May 2009, Buchanan announced that he would be a candidate for re-election to Congress.[21] He defeated Don Baldauf in the Republican primary, and faced Democratic nominee The Reverend James T. Golden in the General. Buchanan won the 2010 General Election for Florida's 13th Congressional District with 68.9% of the vote.[22]
In 2008, Buchanan was accused of campaign fraud by forcing employees of his dealerships to write checks to his campaign, while reimbursing them from his own pocket. The investigation that was called into action was fueled by members on both sides of the aisle and looked into his participation in several counts of fraud. Despite the investigations being called off, numerous witnesses came forward testifying he had made campaign violations.[23]
In 2012 there were no less than four federal and congressional investigations into his business and fundraising activities. Allegations were made that Buchanan used his car dealerships for campaign funding through cash swaps.[24]
On July 10, 2012, the United States House Committee on Ethics cleared Buchanan of charges that he violated House rules by intentionally misleading Congress about his finances. The committee stated the errors found in his financial disclosure forms did not warrant punitive action.[25]
CREWS Most Corrupt has named Buchanan as one of the most corrupt members of Congress for 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012, accusing him of fundraising fraud and tax evasion. Eleven individuals and entities affiliated with Buchanan have been fined for illegal contributions to his campaign.[26]
Buchanan was sworn in as Representative for Florida's 13th Congressional District on 3 January 2007. Congressional Quarterly noted that Buchanan voted in support of President Bush's legislative agenda 66 percent of the time in 2007, the third lowest rate of the 16 members of Florida's Republican congressional delegation.[27] OnTheIssues.org positions Buchanan as a ""Populist Conservative"", while GovTrack.us labels him a ""Moderate Republican"".
Buchanan secured federal funding of $2 million for reimbursement for cleanup efforts in Anna Maria Island and $4 million for cleaning up Wares Creek in Manatee County.[28][29]
Buchanan introduced a constitutional amendment in January 2007 which would require Congress to pass a balanced budget if ratified.[30] He introduced legislation to create a US Postage stamp honoring and assisting disabled veterans, as well as secured funding for the construction of a national veterans' cemetery in Sarasota County.[31][32] Additionally, Buchanan introduced a bill to increase federal assistance for fighting gang crime and secured grant funding for local anti-gang efforts in Manatee County.[33][34]
As of July 2008, Buchanan had voted to override five of President Bush's vetoes of legislation passed by the 110th Congress. These override votes included a vote in support of expanding the coverage range of the SCHIP program, the 2008 farm bill, and the Water Resources Development Act.[35]
On September 29, 2008, Buchanan voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[36] but changed his vote to support the bill on the October 3, 2008 second House vote .[37]
Buchanan sponsored several bills in the 111th Congress, including House Resolution 1839, a Bill to Amend the Small Business Act to Improve SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), which was introduced on April 1, 2009. House Resolution 1839 would require the administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that SCORE increases the proportion of small business mentors from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds, establish benchmarks for evaluating its activities and volunteers, and establish a mentoring program of one-on-one advice to small businesses from qualified counselors.[38]
In the 112th Congress, Buchanan was named to a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, the only Member from Florida serving on that Committee.[39] He was also asked by NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions to serve as Vice Chairman of the Committee, elevating him to an important leadership post.[40]
In January 2011, Buchanan helped secure the construction of Sarasota National Cemetery through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The cemetery plans include 11,500 grave sites, 16,000 cremain sites and other buildings and structures necessary for funerals for veterans and their families.[41]
In June 2011, the House passed Buchanan's ""Military Tribunals for Terrorists Act"" as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act. The bill requires foreign terrorists to be prosecuted by military tribunal, rather than in civilian courts.[42]
In October 2011, Buchanan ""played a large role"" in the passage of free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. The treaty was backed by the White House, and a bipartisan majority in Congress.[43]
In December 2011 the US House passed H.R. 527, part of Buchanan's ""10-point Jobs Plan."" The measure closed ""loopholes in current law to ensure regulatory agencies will fully account for the effect of new regulations on small businesses before regulations are adopted.""[44]
In February 2012, Buchanan supported President Obama's proposal to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 28%. In a statement, Buchanan said, ""I appreciate the president's willingness to engage on such an important issue."" [45]
Buchanan introduced a bill to crack down on so-called prescription drug ""Pill Mills."" ""The proposed legislation would direct money seized from pill mill operators to be used for drug treatment, increase fines and sentences for those convicted of running pill mills and change standards, making hydrocodone drugs -- for example, Vicodin -- harder to obtain."" The bill has bi-partisan support in the House, and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin (WV) introduced companion legislation in the US Senate.[46]
Committee on Ways and Means
In the 113th Congress, Buchanan introduced a resolution denouncing the international practice of shark finning. Buchanans resolution calls for a ban on importing shark fins from fisheries that engage in shark finning.[47]
Congressman Buchanan lives in Longboat Key, Florida with his wife of 31 years, Sandy, whom he met while in college. The Buchanans have two grown sons, James and Matt.[48]
Congressman Buchanan has given both time and money to various community causes, including the Boys and Girls Club, the Community Foundation of Sarasota County, the Walk to Cure Juvenile Diabetes, the American Heart Walk, the Mote Marine Laboratory and the Ringling Museum.[48]
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Buchanan its ""Spirit of Enterprise"" award in 2009 for his support of pro-business legislation. Buchanan is a former board member of the chamber, which endorsed him in the 2006 and 2008 races for the 13th Congressional District seat.[49]
Also in 2009, the Veterans of Foreign Wars gave Buchanan their Legislative Achievement Award for his work on legislation improving the quality of life of active and reserve service members, military retirees, veterans and their families.[50]"

""Tom"" Rooney (born November 21, 1970) is the U.S. Representative for Florida's 17th congressional district, serving in Congress since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Tom Rooney was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3][5] When Tom was 14 his father, Patrick J. Rooney Sr., moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida where the family owned a dog track and gambling business.[6][7] He graduated from the Benjamin School in North Palm Beach, Florida in 1989.[8] In college, Rooney played football for Syracuse University and Washington & Jefferson College outside of Pittsburgh where he earned his B.A. in English Literature.[9] He was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.[10]
Rooney attended the University of Florida where he received his M.A. in Political Science.[11] After that he went to the University of Miami School of Law where he received his J.D. and met his wife Tara Lombardi.[12] They became a members of The Florida Bar Association in 1999.
After law school, both Rooney and his wife joined the U.S. Army JAG Corps. In 2001, Tom and Tara, along with their newborn son, were stationed at Fort Hood on 9/11. Rooney spent over four years on Active Duty in the United States Army JAG Corps. Most notably, he served as Special Assistant U.S Attorney at Fort Hood in Texas, prosecuting all civilian crimes on post. Rooney also served in the famed 1st Cavalry Division.[13]
In 2002, Rooney began teaching Constitutional and Criminal Law as an Asst. Prof. in the Dept. of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[14] He received two Army Commendation Medals for his service. Tom and Tara Rooney each completed active duty with the rank of Captain.[15]
During his active duty time in the JAG Corps, he served with fellow future Congressman Patrick Murphy, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who was the first Iraq War veteran elected to the U.S. Congress.[16]
As his first job out of college, Tom Rooney worked for U.S. Senator Connie Mack III, who had worked with Tom's father, Patrick J. Rooney Sr., at one time. Tom started in Senator Mack's mailroom: ""We opened every letter and thats where I learned what peoples issues were. It really helped shape a blank slate in my life.""[4][17] After getting his Masters, he returned to Florida, where he went to work as an Assistant Attorney General. While working as a criminal prosecutor for Attorney General Charlie Crist,[1] he joined the Board of Directors with The Childrens Place at Home Safe, a Palm Beach County shelter that helps abused, neglected, and abandoned children. In 2005, Tom was named CEO of Home Safe and because of his work there, Governor Jeb Bush appointed Rooney to the Childrens Services Council of Palm Beach County Board of Directors in January 2006. After his second year as director, Rooney returned to the Board of Directors of Childrens Place and resumed his practice of law in Stuart, Florida with the law firm of Kramer, Sopko & Levenstein, P.A. He is a graduate of Leadership Palm Beach County.
Rooney challenged Democratic incumbent Tim Mahoney. Mahoney had narrowly won the Republican-leaning district in 2006, after former Congressman Mark Foley abruptly resigned under a cloud of scandal.[1] Florida election law required Foley's name to remain on the general election ballot, with votes for him being transferred to his replacement, State Representative Joe Negron. It was widely believed that this significantly undermined Negron's chances, as many voters would be reluctant to cast a ballot in Foley's name.[18]
Given Mahoney's narrow margin of victory, coupled with the unusual circumstances surrounding the 2006 election, the 16th District was viewed as one of Republicans' best opportunities to take a congressional seat from the Democrats in 2008.[19] In the Republican Party primary, Rooney was endorsed by Florida's Governor, Charlie Crist and defeated State Representative Gayle Harrell and investment banker Hal Valeche. Mahoney, aided by incumbency and having burnished his image as a moderate Blue Dog Democrat, consistently led Rooney in polls throughout the 2008 election cycle until mid-October 2008,[20] when it was revealed that Mahoney, who had promoted a family values image and campaigned against corruption in contrast to the disgraced Foley, had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs and secretly paid off his mistresses to conceal them.[21][22][23] This revelation shifted the race decisively in Rooney's favor, even causing the Palm Beach Post to take the rare step of rescinding its previous endorsement of Mahoney and endorsing Rooney instead.[24][25]
Rooney ran unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Jim Horn and write-in candidate William Dean.[26][27]
Rooney chose to run in the safely Republican 17th district.[28] Approximately one-third of the reapportioned District 17 voters are from Rooney's current District 16.[29][30] He faced an Aug. 14 primary challenge from Joe Arnold, a Republican state committeeman for Okeechobee County and member of the school board. Rooney defeated Arnold in a landslide, getting 74% of vote.[31] Rooney runs in the general election against a retired airline pilot, Democrat William Bronson (formerly an unsuccessful Republican candidate in Massachusetts and Georgia) as well as Socialist Workers Party write-in candidate Tom Baumann (who ran unsuccessful campaigns in Minnesota and in the Borough of Manhattan).[32][33]
Rooney received endorsements in Florida from Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, U.S. Reps. Allen West and Dennis A. Ross as well as from the National Rifle Association.[34] In their Saturday, October 13, edition the Tampa Bay Times recommended Tom Rooney for the District 17 seat, and on October 19, The Tampa Tribune endorsed him.[35][36] The Bradenton Herald recommended Rooney on 26 October.[37]
One of the first bills Rooney introduced in the House was to prevent any money being spent to bring prisoners to Florida from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Another was a bill he co-sponsored to try to reduce the number of military veteran suicides by mandating mental health screenings for returning troops. Although that bill did not pass, the military eventually adopted the reforms Rooney asked for.[1][38] Rooney has been recognized by the city of Stuart, Florida for his efforts to prevent veterans suicides.[39]
Rooney sponsored a bill to name a federal courthouse under construction in Fort Pierce in honor of a St. Lucie County rancher, and former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice, Alto Lee Adams Sr.; Rooney's bill was approved by the House in September 2009, but was not passed by the Senate until September 2012, when the new courthouse had been open for eight months.[40]
Since 2009, Rooney has personally presented Congressional Award medals to young people in his district.[41][42][43][44][45]
In April 2011, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, traveled to Iraq with Rooney and four other members, who met with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Ambassador James Franklin Jeffrey. Rooney said that they discussed with Maliki how the United States and Iraq might interact diplomatically after the U.S. troop withdrawal scheduled for December of that year.[46]
On the evening of February 19, 2012, a man crashed his pickup truck into Rooney's Stuart, Florida office. No one was inside the building at the time. The man claimed he tried to park in front of the building, but instead of pressing the brake, accidentally pressed the accelerator. The driver was cited for careless driving by the Stuart Police Department.[47][48][49]
Rooney, as Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, introduced The Defense of Environment and Property Act in March 2012. This act would make changes to federal water regulations and prevent some prosecutions of farmers and landowners by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.[50] In response to an expansion of federal power to regulate wetlands in a 2011 EPA and Army Corps document that redefined ""navigable waters,"" the Rooney bill defines navigable waters to exclude wetlands without a continuous surface connection to a body of water. The Rooney bill is a companion to a Senate bill introduced by Rand Paul.[51]
A June 2011 bill to defund U.S. operations in Libya was written by Rooney, but defeated on the floor of the House because 89 Republicans voted against it. Rooney accepted responsibility for defeat of the bill, which was in competition with a non-binding resolution to deny President Barack Obama authority to wage war against Libya, saying ""It was my bill. You can blame me. I think we tried to limit funds so our kids weren't in harm's way but not leave NATO on their own. People either wanted all or they wanted nothing.""[52][53]
On 13 September 2012, Rooney said that Obama should be blamed for attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East because the violence, and the deaths of four Americans in the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi, was foreseeable: ""We supported the rebels without taking into account their individual values or motives, and without understanding their ability or plan to govern. We helped these individuals topple a dictator, but then stood on the sidelines as radical extremists assumed power. It should come as no surprise that these movements in the region have given way to violent, anti-American actions.""[54]
Although most of the voters in Rooney's current District 16 are in the new District 18, in January Rooney announced that he would run for the neighboring 17th Congressional district seat, while Allen West declared in the new 18th, due to the fact that West's previous district became unfavorable to a conservative Republican in the 2012 redistricting plan.[29][55][56]
In announcing his decision to run for reelection in Rooney's Congressional district, Allen West said:
""I have always believed the state of Florida would be best served by having both Congressman Tom Rooney and myself in the House of Representatives working to solve our nation's most pressing problems. I have never wavered from my vision; to work to create jobs, restrain federal government spending, reduce America's ever increasing national debt, and provide for a strong national defense to ensure a safer and more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren. Congressman Rooney is a statesman and has been an honorable public servant to the constituents of Florida's 16th Congressional district. It is my goal to continue the success Congressman Rooney has had in Florida's 16th Congressional district in the newly proposed 18th district.""[57]
Rooney favors agricultural subsidies, including crop insurance and sugar price supports, so that food production in this country can better compete with other countries that provide government subsidies to their farmers. Rooney explained that ""I don't want our country to depend on Mexico for our food, and I don't want Florida to lose agriculture jobs that we really need.""[39][58][59]
Rooney fought to remove spending for an alternate engine program (built by GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce plc) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Pentagon had already taken the position that having a single contractor (Pratt & Whitney) will save money. ""The Pentagon has said repeatedly that they do not want it and do not need it, and the American taxpayers certainly cannot afford it, Rooney said.[60]
Rooney sponsored an amendment to the 2012 House spending bill to end funding for the extra engine of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which passed with support from freshman members of the Tea Party Caucus.[61][62] In December 2011 GE abandoned self-funding to continue development of its alternate engine, finally ending the project. Rooney said that the decision by GE ""will finally remove any risk that taxpayers may be saddled with the costs of sustaining an extra engine in the future.""[63]
Rooney criticised Justin Amash in May, 2012, accusing the Michigan Republican of wanting to ""coddle foreign enemy combatants"" because he proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to stop the military from indefinitely detaining suspected terrorists who were caught in the United States. Amash and Congressman Adam Smith said they worried about civil liberties and the constitutionality of allowing indefinite detention of U.S. residents suspected of being terrorists.[64] A Rooney press release said that ""the Amash amendment sacrifices our national security in order to coddle foreign enemy combatants. Never in our nations history have we granted enemy combatants who attack our homeland during a time of war the same rights and privileges of American citizens, but thats exactly what the Amash amendment would do.""[65][66] Rooney's press release was ctiticised in turn by a statement from Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty which accused Rooney of being ""disgracefully dishonest.""[67]
Finally, Rooney issued a statement of support for a competing amendment to the NDAA by congressmen Jeff Landry, Louie Gohmert and Scott Rigell: ""The Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment explicitly re-affirms and protects the constitutional rights of American citizens, and states clearly that no citizens constitutional rights can be denied under the provisions of the defense bill... While its critical that we protect the rights of American citizens, we should absolutely not exploit legitimate concerns in a misguided effort to extend our rights and privileges to foreign terrorists who attack our homeland."" The Amash/Smith amendment was defeated and the Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment was adopted, both by large margins.[68][69]
On June 13, 2012, Rooney was one of five members of Congress (including Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Lynn Westmoreland) to send letters to the Inspectors General[70] of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State seeking investigations into what they claimed was the U.S. governments involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood.
One of the letters in particular to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, used the Department's Deputy Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin ""has three family membersher late father, her mother and her brotherconnected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations,"" referring to a study by the Center for Security Policy.[71][72][73]
Republican Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Scott Brown, as well as Bachmann's former campaign chief Ed Rollins defended Abedin against these allegations.[74][75] Speaker of the House John Boehner told reporters: ""I don't know Huma. But from everything that I do know of her, she has a sterling character, and I think accusations like this being thrown around are pretty dangerous.""[76] Congressman Mike Simpson condemned the letter as a revival of McCarthyism, telling the Idaho Statesman: ""Unfortunately, it's not just Michele. The public says, 'There go those Republicans again.' It's a bad reflection on all Republicans. I can't believe the other four members she got to sign the letter with her. Amazing... That doesn't reflect the House Republican Caucus.""[77]
An editorial in Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers also brought up the ghost of McCarthyism, explicitly pronouncing disappointment in Rooney.[78] On the other hand, Newt Gingrich argued in favor of investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, characterizing Rooney and the rest as the ""National Security Five.""[79] Columnist Cal Thomas shrugged off the specter of McCarthyism, and said that the real possibility of infiltration by Islamic extremists deserves to be investigated.[80]
Responding to her critics, Bachmann said that ""The concerns I have and my colleagues have are real,"" and ""We cannot elevate political correctness over national security.""[81] Rooney expressed similar concerns: ""As a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, my top priority is ensuring the security of our nation."" And that ""I regret that Mrs. Abedin has become the media focus of this story, because the intention of the letters was to bring greater attention to the legitimate national security risk.""[82] A couple of months later, Rooney admitted that it was an unfortunate mistake to include Mrs. Abedin: ""What got lost was a legitimate question, for the sake of using Congressman (Anthony) Weiner's wife and Sec. Clinton's assistant's name specifically in a letter.""[83]
During an October campaign stop in Florida to support Mitt Romney, John McCain acknowledged that Rooney and Bachmann had realized that including Abedin's name in the letter to the State Department was a mistake. McCain then softened his earlier criticism from the Senate floor, saying ""I'm concerned, and they're concerned and I agree with them, about the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying all members of the Muslim Brotherhood are extremists, but I am saying there are some extremists that are members of the Muslim Brotherhood. ... There is definitely a threat of radical Muslim extremism, some of whom are Muslim Brotherhood  not all, by far.""[84]
Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution provide nutrients that can cause algae blooms, which in turn produce toxins harmful to humans and animals across the state of Florida. Approximately 1,900 miles of rivers and streams in the state were impaired for nutrients in 2010, up from approximately 1000 miles in 2008. Impaired acres of lakes in Florida were 378,000 in 2010, up from 350,000 acres in 2008.[85]
In 2008 the public interest law firm Earthjustice sued the EPA on behalf of five environmental groups, claiming that delays by both state and federal governments in establishing quantitaive (rather than qualitative) limits for nutrient pollution of Florida's waters were unacceptable. In August 2009 the Obama administration settled the lawsuit by agreeing to begin the process of imposing enforceable EPA standards for nutrient levels in the public waters of Florida.[86]
Numerical nutrient level standards announced in November 2010 provoked the State of Florida to fight back by suing the EPA (enraging Earthjustice and environmentalists). Florida's outgoing (Bill McCollum) and incoming (Pam Bondi) Attorneys General, as well as the outgoing (Charles H. Bronson) and incoming (Adam Putnam) Agriculture Commissioners said that the EPA standards ""are not not based on scientifically sound methodology, and were adopted in an arbitrary and capricious manner just to settle a lawsuit."" The EPA said that the regulations would not be implemented for 15 months.[87][88]
One year later, Earthjustice counterattacked by filing suit against the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) claiming that the state agency had failed to protect Floridians and tourists from toxic algae outbreaks.[89] Judge Bram Canter of the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings ruled against the Earthjustice lawsuit in June, 2012.[90] The Obama administration then announced that EPA enforcement would be delayed until 2013, and that the EPA may defer to FDEP regulations.[91][92]
After the EPA said that it would establish numeric nutrient levels for waters in the state of Florida, as part of the 2009 consent decree with Earthjustice, Rooney lead the state's congressional delegation by writing a letter asking the EPA to work with the state as it formulated rules for Florida. Rooney explained:
""Florida has spent over $19 million and several years collecting the necessary data, sound science and community input to develop standards that are realistic and attainable for Florida. As the EPA begins to establish nutrient levels for Florida waters, it is important for the state to be a part of the decision process and to use the invaluable information that has been collected. This bipartisan letter signed by twenty-five members of our delegation simply asks EPA to work with Florida and utilize its data.""[93]
Following the January 2010 publication of proposed EPA rules for Florida, Rooney said: ""There are still too many questions that must be answered regarding the science used by the EPA.""[94] Rooney and other members of Florida's Congressional delegation met with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson in March, concerning the proposed Numeric Nutrient rules. At that meeting the agency agreed to extend the public comment period and to hold three more public meetings in Florida. Rooney also told Jackson that he was concerned, inasmuch as she had failed to meet personally with Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael Sole. Rooney said: ""While there was progress in some areas the EPA proposal will have massive repercussions throughout our state. Therefore, this is something we cannot rush head-first into without knowing all the facts and science.""[95] Rooney pointed to studies concluding that the proposed rule would take $2 billion out of Florida's economy, and urged the EPA to do an economic analysis of the rule. He also called for the EPA to allow an independent, scientific review of the rule, which the EPA refused to do.[96]
An April, 2010 report by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, in conjunction with professors at the University of Florida Food and Resource Economics Department, and with Soil and Water Engineering Technology, Inc. concluded that compliance with the proposed numeric nutrient rule would subject 13.6 million acres of agriculture to direct costs of from $902 million to $1.605 billion annually, and indirect economic impacts of $1.148 billion per year to the state of Florida. ""This report confirms what we have all feared. The economic ramifications of this proposed rule would be devastating to our state,"" Rooney said.[97] In August, Rooney again called for delay of final federal rulemaking, pending the results of a third-party analysis, in a bipartisan letter from Floridas Congressional delegation to Lisa Jackson.[98]
In September, a federal judge temporarily stopped the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from imposing federal water quality standards on former croplands in the Everglades, ruling that the Corps had changed its rules about water quality standards on former croplands without proper public notice and hearing.[99] In December, 2010, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum and Attorney General-elect Pam Bondi decided to file a lawsuit against the EPA regarding its proposed numeric nutrient rule. Rooney endorsed that decision, saying that ""this lawsuit will put a stop to the EPAs misguided assaults on Floridas families and industries."" Senator George LeMieux also endorsed the legal challenge to the EPA rule for Florida.[100]
After Lisa Jackson appeared before the House Agriculture Committee in March 2011, Rooney said: ""In all the hearings Ive attended as a member of Congress, Ive never been to one like Lisa Jacksons appearance before the House Agriculture Committee. All the members of the committee -- Republicans and Democrats -- were up in arms over the EPAs agenda. Ive never seen a witness from the administration get attacked like that from members of the presidents own party.""[101] Rooney sent a letter thanking Jackson for her promise that the EPA would cooperate with the state of Florida (and their Congressional delegation) to come up with reasonable nutrient levels, and for allowing both scientific review and economic analysis of the new regulations. Rooney's letter also asked the following questions:[102]
Rooney and Senator Marco Rubio were criticised in the press for ""siding with polluters"" and ""greedy business interests,"" leading Rooney and Rubio to co-author an article explaining that ""half of the Democrats in Florida's House delegation supported our amendment to prevent the EPA from enforcing this new mandate until they complete an independent study of the science and a thorough economic analysis"" and that Lisa Jackson had recently committed to having the EPA work with Florida's DEP.[103][104] Although the Rooney amendment was eventually dropped, the EPA agreed to a one-year delay of new water rules and that the National Academy of Sciences would conduct an unbiased review of the EPA cost estimate.[105][106][107]
Rooney was criticized in an editorial for voting for a House bill sponsored by John Mica that would prohibit tightening water pollutant limits without a state's consent, a bill that the EPA protested would ""overturn almost 40 years of federal legislation by preventing EPA from protecting public health and water quality.""[108] In an October 2011 column, Rooney justified congressional review of EPA regulations, reduction of red tape and interference with new mandates as a means to ""get the federal government off the backs of famers.""[109]
Rooney welcomed amended rules for numeric nutrient standards, approved in December by the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission and submitted to the EPA. After final approval by the EPA, the federal standards would then be withdrawn. The EPA acknowledged that ""states have the primary role in establishing and implementing water quality standards for their waters.""[85][110] In June, 2012, Florida submitted, and the EPA approved, a plan to improve water quality in the Everglades.[111][112][113]
Tom Rooney is a grandson of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr.[114] and a first cousin, once removed, of actresses Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.[115][116]
Rooney is also related to Pittsburgh Steelers owner and ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney.[115] Tom's younger brother, Brian J. Rooney, has a seat on the Pittsburgh Steelers Board of Directors which was previously held by their father. Brian, a veteran of the Iraq War, is a Deputy Director of Michigan Department of Human Services, and was a candidate in 2010 for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district.[117][118][119] Tom's older brother, Patrick J. Rooney Jr., serves in the Florida House of Representatives in District 83.[120][121]
Tom, Tara and their three sons (Tommy,Sean,Seamus )split their time between Tequesta, Florida and Washington D.C.[2] Rooney decided to run in the new District 17, and he promised to move into that district, but told The Ledger that he and his wife have not yet decided on which city.[122] Rooney plans to move to Charlotte County, but he says that ""I'm leaving where I grew up. That's the hardest thing.""[30] Charlotte County has the largest percentage of voters in the newly-drawn district, and includes the city of Punta Gorda (where Rooney has his campaign office and one of his Congressional offices) as well as the larger, but unincorporated Port Charlotte as well as other unincorporated communities.[2][123][124]
Tom's grandfather, Art Rooney, bought the Palm Beach Kennel Club in West Palm Beach in 1969 and his father ran the business as president from 1984 until recently, when his brother, Patrick J. Rooney Jr., became president of the club.[125][126] Tom Rooney lists ownership of stock in family businesses in his congressional financial disclosure form. Rooney has said that he has neither operational nor ownership responsibilities, and the stock is part of a trust with his children as beneficiaries.[127] In 2010, Rooney stood at 346th place in terms of net worth among the members of the U.S. House.[128]
The Palm Beach Kennel Club serves the product of yet another family business, Rooney's Old Irish Ale.[129] The Palm Beach County Commission has approved a referendum for the November 2012 ballot to decide whether slot machines will be allowed at the Palm Beach Kennel Club.[130] Tom's cousin Joe Rooney is a spokesman for, as well as Co-Chair and Treasurer of the coalition supporting the Palm Beach County slot machines referendum.[126][131] Other Florida counties have put slot machine referendums on the November ballot, but Attorney General Palm Bondi issued an opinion that current state law does not allow slots outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties.[132] Joe Rooney said Palm Beach County will have several paths to follow if the referendum succeeds, including legislation and legal action.[133]
In 2014 Rooney made a cameo appearance as a farmer in Walt Before Mickey starring Thomas Ian Nicholas, Jon Heder, and Armando Gutierrez."

Murphy was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012, defeating Republican incumbent Allen West by 0.8% in the most expensive U.S. House race in history.[1] Despite the narrow Republican lean of Murphy's district, he was re-elected with 60% of the vote in 2014.


Murphy was born in Miami and raised in Key Largo. Murphy attended Palmer Trinity School in Miami from grades 7-12 before graduating from the elite Lawrenceville School, a private prep school in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, in 2002.[2] He says he worked as a construction laborer for his family's company while going to college at University of Miami.[3]
As a 19-year-old freshman college student in 2003, Murphy was arrested outside a Miami Beach night club on charges of disorderly intoxication and possessing a fake driver license. The arrest affidavit said Murphy and his friend were escorted from the club by security, appeared drunk and were disrupting business and assaulting customers, with Murphy receiving a black eye from a fight. After being warned they would be arrested if they didn't leave, Murphy and his friend left in a cab, but the cab returned with the driver complaining that the passengers were drunk and refused to pay. The intoxication charge was ultimately dropped for lack of evidence and the fake ID charge was dismissed. Murphy called the incident ""the biggest mistake of my life"" and the ""biggest learning experience of my life"".[4]
After earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Miami in accounting and finance, Murphy spent a year as a Certified Public Accountant at Deloitte and Touche before being hired as vice president of his family's construction business.[5] After the 2010 BP oil spill he was tasked with creating a subsidiary of his father's company, called Coastal Environmental, that secured contracts to remove oil in the Gulf of Mexico.[6]
A 2011 gift of stock from his father boosted his personal net worth by one to five million dollars.[7]
In 2012 Murphy moved from Fort Lauderdale to Jupiter to be eligible to run for the 18th congressional district.[8] Murphy claims he was so taken aback by some of the things Republican incumbent Representative Allen West was saying in Congress and on television that he felt compelled to run against him.[5] As a result, he took the campaign strategy of selling himself as a West alternative.[9] Murphy was supported by Florida's former Republican Governor Charlie Crist and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, along with Republican Sheriff of Martin County Bob Crowder, who ran against West in the primaries.[10][11] The race was among the most expensive congressional races in 2012,[12] and called one of the ugliest in the 2012 campaign, as well as one of the closest.[13]
After a close vote, the state of Florida certified a Murphy victory over West, days after the election.[14] The West campaign claimed there were errors in the vote counting process and took legal action to request a recount of disputed votes.[15] On November 20, 2012, the West campaign conceded the election to Murphy, who won by a margin of 2429 votes.[16]
Murphy ran for re-election in 2014, and was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program, designed to protect their most vulnerable incumbents.[17] Despite this, he won his bid for a second term by defeating Republican candidate Carl Domino, a former State Representative, with almost 60% of the vote,[18] even out-polling Republican Governor Rick Scott in the heavily Republican Martin County, which he carried with 55.4% of the vote.[19] He raised and spent over $5.3 million, more than any other House Democrat who ran for re-election. Of his 13 television advertisements, none of them attacked his Republican opponent.[19]
Murphy was a member of the Republican Party, donating the maximum individual contribution of $2,300 to Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign and $4,800 to other Republican candidates, until four months prior to announcing his candidacy for Congress, at which time he switched his registration to the Democratic Party and donated $4,000 to a variety of Democratic candidates.[20] He says he switched from being a Republican and a Mitt Romney supporter because of his disgust with the Tea Party movement.[20] Murphy was described in The Huffington Post as a ""pro-choice, pro-LGBT rights but 'not ultra-liberal' Democrat who values fiscal responsibility.""[5] The top five contributors to Murphy's campaign committee for the 2013-2014 time period were his family's construction company, Deloitte, Suntech Plumbing, Goldman Sachs, and J Street PAC.[21]
In 2014 Murphy was one of 36 members of congress to sign a letter urging the U.S. House Appropriations Committee to block a U.S. Department of Education proposal to tighten regulation of for profit universities.[22]
Murphy also received his Bachelor's Degree from the University of Miami
In 2013 Murphy voted in support of the Northern Route Approval Act, which would have allowed Congress to unilaterally approve construction of the Keystone Pipeline without the approval of the Obama administration.[23] The American Petroleum Institute praised Murphy's vote, saying ""it shows that he understands the importance of putting Americas economy and energy future ahead of politics.""[24]
In 2014 Murphy voted in favor of establishing the United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi.[25]
Murphy supported the Affordable Care Act and voted against its repeal in May 2013.[26] In November 2013, Murphy signed on to a Republican-sponsored bill to waive the minimum coverage requirements of the act.[27]

"106","","1993","1936","Florida 20","Fisk University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcee_Hastings","Alcee Hastings","Democratic","Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida","African Methodist","Alcee Lamar Hastings (born September 5, 1936) is the U.S. Representative for Florida's 20th congressional district, serving in Congress since 1993. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He served as a Judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida from 1979 until his impeachment and removal from that post in 1989. He is one of only eight federal officials in American history to be impeached and removed from office.


Born in Altamonte Springs, Florida, Hastings was educated at Howard University in Washington, D.C. and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He earned his bachelor's degree in zoology and botany from Fisk in 1958. He received his law degree from Florida A&M University in 1963. While in school, he became a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.
He began to practice law in 1964.
Hastings decided to run for U.S. Senate in 1970 after incumbent Spessard Holland decided to retire. He failed to win the Democratic primary, or make the run-off election. He ranked fourth out of five candidates, receiving 13% of the vote. Governor Farris Bryant ranked first with 33% of the vote. Lawton Chiles ranked second with 26% of the vote. Chiles defeated Bryant in the run-off election and won the November general election.[1]
In 1977, he became a judge of the circuit court of Broward County, Florida. In 1979, he was appointed by President Carter as a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida.
In 1981, Hastings was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in exchange for a lenient sentence and a return of seized assets for 21 counts of racketeering by Frank and Thomas Romano, and of perjury in his testimony about the case. In 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, William Borders, refused to testify in court (resulting in a jail sentence for Borders).[2]
In 1988, the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413-3. He was then convicted in 1989 by the United States Senate (also controlled by the Democrats), becoming the sixth federal judge in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate. The Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment. It convicted Hastings of eight of the 11 articles. The vote on the first article was 69 for and 26 opposed,[3] providing five votes more than the two-thirds of those present that were needed to convict. The first article accused the judge of conspiracy. Conviction on any single article was enough to remove the judge from office.
The Senate had the option to forbid Hastings from ever seeking federal office again, but did not do so. Alleged co-conspirator attorney William Borders went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings, but was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.[4]
Hastings filed suit in federal court claiming that his impeachment trial was invalid because he was tried by a Senate committee, not in front of the full Senate, and that he had been acquitted in a criminal trial. Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled in favor of Hastings, remanding the case back to the Senate, but stayed his ruling pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court in a similar case regarding Judge Walter Nixon, who had also been impeached and removed.[5]
Sporkin found some ""crucial distinctions""[6] between Nixon's case and Hastings's, specifically, that Nixon had been convicted criminally, and that Hastings was not found guilty by two-thirds of the committee who actually ""tried"" his impeachment in the Senate. He further added that Hastings had a right to trial by the full Senate.
The Supreme Court, however, ruled in Nixon v. United States that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over Senate impeachment matters, so Sporkin's ruling was vacated and Hastings's conviction and removal were upheld.[7]
Hastings attempted to make a political comeback by running for Secretary of State of Florida, campaigning on a platform of legalizing casinos. In a three-way Democratic primary, he placed second with 33% of the vote, behind newspaper columnist Jim Minter's 38% of the vote. In the runoff, which saw a large dropoff in turnout, Minter defeated him in a landslide, 67%-33%. He won only one of Florida's 67 counties: Miami-Dade.[8] Minter lost the general election to incumbent Republican James C. Smith.
Hastings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, representing Florida's 23rd district. After placing second in the initial Democratic primary for the post, he scored an upset victory over State Representative Lois J. Frankel in the runoff and went on to easily win election in the heavily-Democratic district. From that point on he has yet to face a serious challenge for reelection. Subsequent to redistricting and the 2012 election, Alcee Hastings represents Florida's 20th district beginning January 2013.
Hastings is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and was elected President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in July 2004. Today, as a Senior Democratic Whip, Hastings is an influential member of the Democratic leadership. Representative Hastings is also a member of the powerful House Rules Committee and is a senior Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). On the HPSCI, Hastings is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
He was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[9]
Hastings voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented against him on June 19, 2009.[10]
After the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Hastings attracted attention after it was reported that incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi might appoint him as head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He had support from the Congressional Black Caucus, but was opposed by the Blue Dog Coalition. Hastings attacked his critics as misinformed fools. Pelosi reportedly favored Hastings instead of the ranking Democrat Jane Harman due to policy differences and support by the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] On November 28, 2006, Pelosi announced that Hastings would not be the Committee's chairman,[12] and later she chose Silvestre Reyes (D-TX) instead. While Representative Hastings was passed over to chair the committee he became chair of a sub-committee. He told the National Journal that I am not angry. At some point along the way, it became too much to explain. That is legitimate politics. But its unfortunate for me.[13]
On September 24, 2008, Hastings came under fire for controversial comments made regarding Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Hastings, speaking in Washington D.C. to a conference sponsored by the National Jewish Democratic Council, said ""If Sarah Palin isn't enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama, then you damn well had better pay attention. Anybody toting guns and stripping moose don't care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks. So, you just think this through."" [14]
On September 29, 2008, Hastings issued an apology via a written statement, while standing by its core message: ""I regret the comments I made last Tuesday that were not smart and certainly not relevant to hunters or sportsmen. The point I made, and will continue to make, is that the policies and priorities of a McCain-Palin administration would be anathema to most African Americans and Jews. I regret that I was not clearer and apologize to Governor Palin, my host where I was speaking, and those who my comments may have offended.""[15]
In May 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hastings spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money in 2008 to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan. The Journal noted that the expenditure was legal, properly accounted for, and drawn from an expense allowance the U.S. government grants to all lawmakers.[16]
In March 2010, Hastings defended the Democrats approach to passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying ""I wish that I had been there when Thomas Edison made the remark that I think applies here: 'There ain't no rules around here, we're trying to accomplish something.' And therefore, when the deal goes down, all this talk about rules, we make them up as we go along.""[17]
In June 2011, a lawsuit filed by one of his staff members, Winsome Packer, alleged that Hastings made repeated unwanted sexual advances and threatened her job when she refused him.[18] A Congressional Ethics Panel investigated these claims.[18] Packer was being represented by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch. Hastings denied the claims and called them ""ludicrous.""[19] He stated that ""I will win this lawsuit. That is a certainty. In a race with a lie, the truth always wins. And when the truth comes to light and the personal agendas of my accusers are exposed, I will be vindicated.[20] In February 2012, it was reported that Hastings would be released from the lawsuit, and it would only continue against the Helsinki Commission.[21]
In a 2011 survey of U.S. lawmakers, the Center for Responsive Politics named Hastings the ""Poorest Member of Congress,"" with a 2010 average net worth of $4,732,002.[22] His congressional financial disclosure form indicated that, as of 2010, Hastings did not have any earned income, he had a bank account with a balance in the $1,000 to $15,000 range, and he owed several million dollars in legal fees to several attorneys stemming from 19811989 charges.[23]
In 2012, Hastings was ranked No. 1 out of 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch.[24] A 300-page report published by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found that Hastings paid his girlfriend $622,574 over the four-year period 2007-2010.

""Ted"" Deutch (born May 7, 1966) is a Democratic member of the U.S. Representative for Florida's 21st congressional district. He first won election to Congress during a special election in April 2010 in Florida's 19th district. He previously served in the Florida Senate. In 2012, due to redistricting, he ran for and won re-election in Florida's 21st district.[1]


Deutch was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the son of Jean (ne Mindlin) and the late Bernard Deutch, who earned a Purple Heart during World War II. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Belarus.[2] Deutch graduated from the University of Michigan, where he served as Editor-in-Chief of Consider magazine, and the University of Michigan Law School. He received the Harry S. Truman Scholarship in 1986 while attending the University of Michigan.
Before running for Congress, Deutch worked as a commercial development attorney with the Florida law firm of Broad and Cassel.
In 2009, Deutch authored the ""Protecting Floridas Health Act"", a public health initiative with the goal of reducing youth smoking through an increased surcharge on tobacco products. The legislation funded up to $1 billion health care programs in Florida, including $50 million per year in dedicated cancer research funding. The legislation earned him national recognition as winner of the National Distinguished Advocacy Award given by the American Cancer Society.
In the Senate, Deutch has also passed legislation which attempted to improve health care for seniors, promote public education, and protect children and the environment. In addition, he helped to secure a new senior center in Palm Beach County and provided new services for Holocaust survivors.
As a member of the National Young Leadership Cabinet of United Jewish Communities, Deutch organized over 2,500 people to march on Capitol Hill in Washington, with the intent of pressuring Congress on a slate of issues affecting children and the elderly. At the end of his tenure in the Senate, Deutch was serving as Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries and the Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means.[3]
In late 2009, Deutch declared himself a candidate in a special election to fill the 19th congressional district seat formerly held by Robert Wexler, who left Congress to lead the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation. He won the Democratic primary with 85% of the vote, and on April 13, 2010, won the special election, defeating Republican Edward J. Lynch.[4]
Deutch's district is located on the east coast of Florida. It includes parts of Palm Beach and Broward counties, and the city of Coral Springs. The district trends Democratic, giving 65% of its votes to President Barack Obama in 2008.
Deutch was challenged by Republican nominee Joe Budd and write-in candidate Stan Smilan.[5] He won the election.
After Florida underwent redistricting in 2012, Deutch filed for re-election in Florida's 21st district.[1] Deutch easily won the November 6, 2012 general election with no major party opposition.[6]
Shortly after his election, Deutch introduced the Preserving our Promise to Seniors Act, which aims to keep Social Security benefits in line with retirees' costs and gradually lifts the cap on FICA taxes over a period of seven years.[7]
During the 2011 debate over the debt ceiling, Deutch assembled and brought to the House floor an elaborate, game-show style to illustrate which government services he claimed would be endangered by a default on the U.S. national debt.[8]
In 2011, Deutch was one of several cosponsors of the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a bill that would permit copyright holders to effectively shut down websites that they believed to be directly or indirectly contributing to copyright infringement. To achieve this, the copyright holder would need to request and obtain a court order from the U.S. Department of Justice by making a statement of good-faith belief that the copyright was being violated. The Act was tabled following extensive online and offline protests.
On November 19, 2011, Rep. Deutch introduced a resolution[9] proposing ""an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to expressly exclude for-profit corporations from the rights given to natural persons by the Constitution of the United States, prohibit corporate spending in all elections, and affirm the authority of Congress and the States to regulate corporations and to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures"".
Rep. Deutchs amendment is a blend of ""ideas from ""Move to Amend, Free Speech for People, Public Citizen, People For the American Way, Common Cause, and the Center for Media and Democracy"".[10]
""Article--
""Section 1. The rights protected by the Constitution of the United States are the rights of natural persons and do not extend to for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, or other private entities established for business purposes or to promote business interests under the laws of any state, the United States, or any foreign state.
""Section 2. Such corporate and other private entities established under law are subject to regulation by the people through the legislative process so long as such regulations are consistent with the powers of Congress and the States and do not limit freedom of the press.
""Section 3. Such corporate and other private entities shall be prohibited from making contributions or expenditures in any election of any candidate for public office or the vote upon any ballot measure submitted to the people.
""Section 4. Congress and the States shall have the power to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures, including a candidate's own spending, and to authorize the establishment of political committees to receive, spend, and publicly disclose the sources of those contributions and expenditures.""
Deutch was sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives on April 15, 2010. He retained several staffers from Robert Wexler, including the former Congressman's deputy chief of staff.
A new joint action committee for the Greek-Israeli alliance has been created in early 2013 by Ted Deutch and Congress member Gus Bilirakis, Republican representative from Florida. The creation and goals of the Greek-Israeli Caucus under the name Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance were announced at a special event held in the Congress.[11] The Greek-Israeli Caucus consists of powerful members of both Republican and Democratic party[12][13][14]

Frankel was born in 1948[3] in New York City and received a bachelor's degree from Boston University in 1970. She earned a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1973.[4] Frankel moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1974.[2]
In 1986, incumbent Democratic state representative Eleanor Weinstock of the 83rd district decided to run for a seat in the Florida Senate. Frankel ran for Weinstock's open seat in the Florida House, and defeated Republican nominee Gerald Adams 69%-31% in November 1986.[5] In 1988, she won re-election to a second term unopposed;[6] in 1990, she again was unopposed.[7]
In November 1991, Frankel resigned as state representative, to run for Congress in 1992.[8] Mimi McAndrews, a former aide of Frankel's, was elected to replace her. Frankel lost to fellow Democratic representative Alcee Hastings in the 1992 congressional primary.
In 1994 Frankel challenged, and after a bitter campaign, defeated McAndrews in the Democratic primary for her old State House seat.[9] Frankel won the November 1994 general election with 55% of the vote.[10] In 1996, she won re-election to a fifth term with 68% of the vote.[11] In 1998, she won re-election to a sixth term with 64% of the vote.[12] In 2000, she won re-election to a seventh term with 63% of the vote.[13]
During her first period as a state legislator, Frankel was State House Majority Whip.[14] While in office from 1995 to 2003, Frankel became the first female House Minority Leader in Florida's history and co-authored a change to Florida's already existing AIDS omnibus law originally passed in 1988.[2] She left office due to term limits in 2002 after serving fourteen years in the State House.[2][4]
In 1992, she decided to retire from the State House to run for the newly created Florida's 23rd district. In the Democratic primary, Frankel ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold necessary to win outright and avoid a run-off election.[16] In the run-off election, former U.S. District Court Judge Alcee Hastings defeated Frankel 57%-43%.[2][17]
In 2002, Frankel entered and then dropped out of the 2002 election for Governor of Florida, in which Governor Jeb Bush won re-election.[2]
On March 11, 2003, Frankel defeated incumbent Democratic West Palm Beach Mayor Joel Daves in the mayoral election.[2] Frankel was endorsed in the race by former West Palm Beach Mayor Nancy Graham.[2] Frankel won with 56% of the vote to 38% for Daves.[2][18] She was sworn into office on March 27, 2003, as the city's third strong mayor.
In 2007, Frankel won re-election to a second term, defeating Al Zucaro 58%-42%.[19]
On March 31, 2011, due to term limits, Frankel left office as Mayor of West Palm Beach after two-terms. In the race to succeed her, West Palm Beach city commissioner Jeri Muoio, was elected that month, with 51% of the vote, on a platform of business development and pension reform.[20]
On March 21, 2011, Frankel announced that she would run in the newly redrawn Florida's 22nd congressional district in the upcoming 2012 House election.[21] On August 14 she defeated Democrat primary rival Kristin Jacobs, and moved forward to the November election against Republican Adam Hasner.[22]
Frankel was criticized for acceptance of $20,000.00 from Digital Domain Media Group for her election campaign five months after that company was awarded a downtown project which included incentives from the city of West Palm Beach, and in response vowed to give the contribution to charity.[23]
Frankel went on to win the general election on November 6, 2012, defeating Hasner 54.7% to 45.3%.[24]"

She is the U.S. Representative for Florida's 23rd congressional district, a member of the Democratic Party and the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. She previously served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate. She is the first Jewish congresswoman elected from Florida. The district covers parts of Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, including the densely populated coastal cities of Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach.


Born Deborah Wasserman in Forest Hills, Queens, New York,[1] she is the daughter of Ann and Larry Wasserman. Her father is a CPA.[2] She has a younger brother, Steve. From 1968 to 1978 the family lived in Lido Beach, Nassau County, New York. In 1978, her family moved to Melville, Suffolk County, New York where Wasserman graduated from high school in 1984.[3] She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1988 and a Master of Arts with certificate in political campaigning in 1990, both in Political Science, from the University of Florida in Gainesville.[4][5]
At the University of Florida, Wasserman Schultz was active in student government, serving as President of the Student Senate and the founder and president of the Rawlings Area Council Government.[4] She was also a member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, the James C. Grimm chapter of the National Residence Hall Honorary, and the union Graduate Assistants United, and she served as President of the Graduate Student Council and Vice President of the UF College Democrats.[4][6] She had credited her experience in student politics with developing her ""love for politics and the political process"".[7]
In 1988, Wasserman Schultz became an aide to Peter Deutsch at the beginning of his state legislative career.[5][8] In 1992, Deutsch made a successful run for United States House of Representatives for Florida's 20th District. Wasserman Schultz recalled getting a call from Deutsch at the time: ""It was really amazing. He called me at home one day in the middle of the legislative session and he said, You could run in my race, your house is in my district.""[8] Wasserman Schultz won 53 percent of the vote in a six-way Democratic primary and avoided a runoff.[8] She went on to win the general election and succeeded Deutsch in Florida's House of Representatives. At age 26, she became the youngest female legislator in the state's history.[5][9]
She served in the Florida State House of Representatives for eight years, and had to leave office due to state term limits.[5] She became an adjunct instructor of political science at Broward Community College, as well as a public policy curriculum specialist at Nova Southeastern University. With her experience in the Florida House, she ran successfully for the Florida State Senate in 2000. She supported legislation requiring gender-price parity for dry cleaning and an equal number of men and women were appointed to state boards.[citation needed] She supported several bills including the Florida Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act and one creating a Children's Services Council for Broward County. She received an award from the Save The Manatee Club for her commitment to manatee protection.
Wasserman Schultz is a member of the New Democrat Coalition. She was appointed to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in her first term. During the 2006 elections, she raised over seventeen million dollars in campaign contributions for her Democratic colleagues (third most after Nancy Pelosi and Rahm Emanuel), she was chosen as Chief Deputy Whip and appointed to the Appropriations Committee, a plum assignment for a sophomore congresswoman.[citation needed]
She currently chairs the Committee's Legislative Branch subcommittee, which Pelosi returned to the Committee after it was dissolved by Republican leadership in 2005. Shortly after acquiring her spot on the Appropriations Committee, Wasserman Schultz received the waiver necessary to sit on an additional committee (Appropriations is typically an exclusive committee), and she is currently a member of the Judiciary Committee. Aside from her committee and leadership roles, she is a member of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's ""30 Something"" Working Group, which consists of congressional Democrats under age 40. The group concentrates on issues affecting young people, including Social Security. She also has joined the bipartisan Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. According to the Congress.org 2008 Power Rankings, she was the 24th most powerful member of the House and 22nd most powerful Democratic representative (also most powerful Florida representative).[10]
Wasserman Schultz is pro-choice, pro-firearm restriction legislation, and a supporter of the LGBT community. She initiated the 2007 Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act. In 2011, Wasserman Schultz was one of the 23 co-sponsors of H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).[11]
During the Terri Schiavo case, she was one of the strongest opponents of congressional intervention. She publicly accused President George W. Bush of hypocrisy for signing a 1999 bill as governor of Texas that allows health care workers to remove life support for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills. During the debate Wasserman Schultz pointed out that a Texas law signed into law by then Gov. George W. Bush allowed caregivers to withhold treatment ""at the point that futility has been reached and there is no longer any hope of survival or of additional health care measures being used to sustain life.... [this] seems to conflict with his position today."" Cox News Service reported that ""The Texas law was intended to control in cases in which medical teams and patients' representatives disagree on treatment. In the Schiavo case, the medical team and Schiavo's husband agreed that there was no hope of improvement in her condition, determined by lower courts to be a 'persistent vegetative state'.""[12] Wasserman Schultz also cited the case of a six-month-old Texas baby whose life support had been removed in accord with this law and over the objections of his family while the Schiavo controversy was ongoing.
After the controversy Wasserman Schultz issued a statement that said, ""The Congress is not an objective body. It is a partisan, political body. Our Members are not doctors or bioethicists. We are elected officials. The Congress is not the appropriate venue to decide end-of-life or any private, personal family dispute. That is why there are court reviews which allow for an objective evaluation of both sides of a dispute. The Congress was never designed for, and our Founding Fathers never intended, the body to make these kinds of decisions. What was lost in the midst of this debate was that this was not about pro-life interest groups, or about the parents or the husband. It wasn't about the President, or the Governor, or the Republican or Democratic party. It was about a personal family tragedy. I am worried about the direction our country is moving in. I am worried when members of Congress and the President try to overstep over twenty court rulings on a case that had gone on for years. I am worried when special interest groups exploit a family tragedy for political and financial gain. I am worried when the federal government attempts to step between a husband and a wife because members of Congress believe they know better.""[13]
While her predecessor and mentor Peter Deutsch was ""among the most hawkish congressional Democrats on Middle East issues"", Wasserman Schultz, who took over his seat for Florida's 20th district, ""a heavily Jewish swath of Broward County"", has taken a more centrist approach.[5] During 2005 she spoke in approval of President George W. Bush's proposals to give financial aid to the Palestinian Authority in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said ""We want to continue to focus on making sure that... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [Bush's] first four years, there was a lack of leadership coming from the administration. I know many people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way I thought, there was an absence of leadership. ... So I'm glad to see there's a little more engagement and involvement from the administration.""[5]
She defended her party against suggestions that the Democrats are anti-Israel, saying ""I would stack up the Democratic caucus's position on the support for Israel against the Republican caucus's any day of the week and be much more confident  and the Jewish community should be much more confident  in the Democrats' stewardship of Israel than the Republicans, especially if you compare the underlying reasons for both groups' support for Israel. The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to Armageddon and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons.""[5]
Wasserman Schultz supports the use of appropriations for future control of presidential signing statements as developed as part of questions during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power July 26, 2008.[14]
Wasserman Schultz is the first Jewish female congressperson from the state of Florida.[15][16]
She and Senator Arlen Specter were the driving forces behind the resolution that declared every May ""Jewish American Heritage Month"". The annual observance was created to recognize ""the accomplishments of American Jews and the important role that members of the Jewish community have played in the development of American culture"".[17] The observance is modeled after Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month and Women's History Month. Wasserman Schultz envisioned ""classroom instruction, public ceremonies and broadcast announcements"", stating ""There's a generation of children growing up with a fading memory of what happened during World War II or even an understanding of anyone who is Jewish or their culture and traditions. Through education comes tolerance.""[18] The bill introducing the observance passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate and signed by President George W. Bush. Wasserman Schultz said of the proclamation ""This is an historic occasion. Generations to come will have the chance to live without anti-Semitism through greater understanding and awareness of the significant role that American Jews have played in U.S. history. Jewish American Heritage Month is a reality because of the people gathered today in this room.""[17]
The measure was criticized by Gary Cass, executive director of the now-defunct Center for Reclaiming America for Christ, a conservative Christian organization based in Fort Lauderdale, who objected to ""teaching Jewish history without talk of religious practices and values"", saying ""We cannot seem to have an honest discussion about the Christian roots of America."" He wondered ""How much tolerance would [Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz] have for a Christian Heritage month?"" She replied that the situation is different, that ""Judaism is unique, because it is both a culture and a religion,"" and that she was not in favor of ""teaching any religion in public schools.""[18] The congreswoman's father, Larry Wasserman, said that while his daughter had not been particularly active in the Jewish community before entering politics, she has ""forged ties with Jewish groups as a lawmaker. She helped to form the National Jewish Democratic Council and served on the regional board of the American Jewish Congress.""[8]
Wasserman Schultz voted on September 29, 2008, for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[19] and on October 3, 2008, for the revised version of that act.[20]
During an April 2009 House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, fellow Floridian Tom Rooney, a former active duty U.S. Army JAG Corps officer, introduced an amendment that would make attacks against military veterans a hate crime. Wasserman Schultz remarked on the amendment:
I'm from a state, as Mr. Rooney is, that includes and represents the districts that include real victims. I represent a very large  one of the largest - gay populations in the United States of America. One of the largest Jewish populations in the United States of America. My region  our region - has a very large African-American population. It really is belittling of the respect that we should have for these groups to suggest that members of the armed services have somehow systematically been the victims of hate crimes.[21]
Wasserman Schultz has been a vocal advocate for the family of Daniel Wultz, constituents of her congressional district engaged in legal action against the Bank of China for its alleged role in financing the terrorist attack that killed the 16-year-old teenager from Weston, Florida in 2006.
In August 2013, Wasserman Schultz told the Miami Herald: In South Florida, we all know too well of the tragic circumstances surrounding the cowardly terrorist attack that took Daniel Wultzs innocent life. I have been working, hand in hand with the Wultz family and the state of Israel to ensure any and all of those involved in this terrorist activity, including the Bank of China, pay for their crimes so that justice can be served.[22]
On May 1, 2014, together with the House Majority Leader, Representative Eric Cantor (R-VA), Wasserman Schultz hosted the Wultz family at the U.S. Capitol in a National Prayer Day event.[23]
On February 15, 2013, Wasserman Schultz introduced the Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013 (H.R. 744; 113th Congress) into the House.[24] The bill would increase the penalties on identity thieves in the United States and change the definition of identity theft to include businesses and organizations instead of just individuals.[25]
In 2004, Wasserman Schultz's mentor Peter Deutsch gave up his Congressional seat to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate seat of fellow Democrat Bob Graham. Wasserman Schultz was unopposed in the Democratic primary election held to fill Deutsch's seat. Her Republican opponent was Margaret Hostetter, a realtor who had never held public office. The 20th is so heavily Democratic that Hostetter faced nearly impossible odds in November. However, she gained notoriety for her attacks on Wasserman Schultz. For example, Hostetter's campaign site criticized Wasserman Schultz for protesting an American flag photograph with a Christian cross on it that was on display in the workstation of a secretary in a government building. Hostetter wrote, ""Elect Margaret Hostetter to Congress November 2 and send the clear message that Americans respect and support... the foundational role Christianity has had in the formation of our great nation. Our rights come from God, not the state."" The voters rejected this viewpoint.
As expected, Wasserman Schultz won, taking 70.2% to Hostetter's 29.8%. However, Hostetter had only spent about $30,000 to get 30% of the vote (compared to Wasserman Schultz's $1.2 million). When Wasserman Schultz was sworn in on January 4, 2005, she chose to use the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Because Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert only had a Christian Bible, a copy of the Tanakh was borrowed by Hastert's staff from Congressman Gary Ackerman for this purpose.[26] (This fact was brought up two years later during the Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress.)[27]
She was unopposed for reelection in 2006.
Wasserman Schultz won against Independent Margaret Hostetter and Socialist write-in candidate Marc Luzietti.
Wasserman Schultz announced her support of Hillary Clinton for her party's 2008 presidential nomination, and in June 2007 was named one of Clinton's national campaign co-chairs. Once Senator Barack Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, she endorsed him and joined Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado and Representative Artur Davis of Alabama to second his nomination at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
On CBS's Face the Nation, she declared Sarah Palin to be unready for the Vice Presidency. ""She knows nothing...Quite honestly, the interview I saw and that Americans saw on Thursday and Friday was similar to when I didn't read a book in high school and had to read the Cliff's Notes and phone in my report"", Wasserman Schultz said of Palin's interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson last week. ""She's Cliff-noted her performance so far.""[28] Wasserman Schultz was also named a co-chair of the Democratic Party's Red to Blue congressional campaign group.[29] Controversy arose in March 2008 when she announced that she would be unable to campaign against South Florida Republican representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen because of her good friendship with them.[30] Wasserman Schultz and Ros-Lehtinen (RFL) are both on the LGBT Equality Caucus of which Wasserman Schultz is the Vice Chair.
Wasserman Schultz was challenged by Republican nominee Karen Harrington and Independents Stanley Blumenthal and Bob Kunst. Florida Whig Party candidate Clayton Schock ran as a write-in.
On April 5, 2011, Vice President Joe Biden announced that Wasserman Schultz was President Barack Obama's choice to succeed Tim Kaine as the 52nd Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Once confirmed by the Democratic National Committee, she became the third female DNC chief in history and the first in over 15 years. Until she assumed office, current DNC Vice-Chair Donna Brazile served as the interim Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Wasserman Shultz was confirmed at the meeting of the DNC held on May 4, 2011, in Washington, D.C.[31]
Wasserman Schultz got off to a controversial start as DNC Chair.[32] During an appearance on Face the Nation, Wasserman Schultz said, ""The Republicans have a plan to end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, 'You know what? You're on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market. We're going to throw you to the wolves and allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions. We're going to give you X amount of dollars and you figure it out'"".[33] Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false.[32] She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, ""You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws and literallyand very transparentlyblock access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates"". The next day, she stated that ""Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use"".[34]
Congresswoman Schultz has also been criticized for what has been termed her ""frequent absences"" from Congress. In 2011 she missed 62 votes of Congress, placing her 45th of 535 in missing Congressional votes. The bulk of those who missed votes did so due to family circumstances, illness, or the Presidential campaign.[35] She has been criticized further for her frequent appearances on MSNBC. Particularly, Dylan Ratigan accused her of coming on his show and just ""doing talking points"".[36] Many of Obamas advisers have questioned the move to select Wasserman Schultz as his DNC chairwoman, who they feel comes across as too partisan on television. An internal focus study of the popularity of top Obama campaign surrogates ranked Wasserman Schultz at the bottom.[37]
As chairwoman of the DNC, Wasserman Schultz appointed Amy Dacey to the position of CEO of the DNC in October, 2013.[38]
In 2012, Wasserman Schultz attempted to get the DNC to pay for her clothing at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.[39]
The Washington Times revealed that Wasserman Schultz had a backup plan of revenge in 2013, in case President Obama did move to replace her from her party position  and that was to paint him as anti-woman and anti-Semitic, various media outlets reported.[40]
Wasserman Schultz lives in Weston, outside Fort Lauderdale. She is a mother of three and is married to Steve Schultz. She is an active member of the National Jewish Democratic Council, Planned Parenthood, and Hadassah.
In March 2009, she revealed that she underwent seven surgeries related to breast cancer in 2008, while maintaining her responsibilities as a member of the House. That year, she promoted efforts for early screening for breast cancer.[41]"

Located in South Florida, Wilson's congressional districtnumbered the 17th during her first two years in Congress, and the 24th since 2013is a majority African-American district that includes the southern parts of Broward County and the eastern parts of Miami-Dade County. Included within the district are Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar, and North Miami. She gained national attention in early 2012 as a result of her high-profile comments on the killing of Trayvon Martin, who was a constituent of hers and whose family she knew personally.[citation needed]
Wilson, who describes herself as a ""voice for the voiceless"", is a member of the Democratic Party.[1] Her seat was left open when the incumbent Kendrick Meek ran for a seat in the Senate in 2010.
Wilson is famous for her large and colorful hats, of which she owns several hundred. She has gone through efforts to get Congress to lift its ban on head coverings during House sessions, which dates back to 1837.[2][3]


Wilson was born Frederica Smith on November 5, 1942 in Miami, Florida, the daughter of Beulah (ne Finley) and Thirlee Smith. Her maternal grandparents were Bahamian.[4][5] Wilson earned her bachelor of arts degree from Fisk University in 1963,[6] and her master of arts degree from the University of Miami in 1972.[7] She served as the Principal of Skyway Elementary School in Miami. She served on the Miami-Dade County School Board from 1992 through 1998.
Wilson represented District 104 in the Florida House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002. She then represented the 33rd District in the Florida Senate from 2003 to 2010. She served as Minority Pro Tempore in 2006, then Minority Lead Whip.
An early supporter, in 2008 she voted for Barack Obama and Joe Biden as one of Florida's presidential electors.[8]
When Kendrick Meek retired from Florida's 17th congressional district to run for the United States Senate in 2010, Wilson ran for the open seat, and won the Democratic nomination to face her Republican challenger to win Meek's seat.[9] On November 2, 2010 she won in the general election without electoral opposition, in a district where the Democratic nomination is tantamount to election.
Wilson's signature issue is education. During her career as an educator, she founded the 5000 Role Models program, which seeks to bring down dropout rates. Since her time in the Florida legislature, she has strongly opposed standardized testing.[10] She has expressed concern with the FCAT, saying the value of the test is not worth the cost of administering it. She suggested banning the tutoring companies from exploiting vulnerable children, ""even if it means banning companies like Ignite! Learning, founded by ex-Governor Jeb Bush's brother, Neil"".[11]
Frederica Wilson has taken a vocal opposition to the Tea Party. At a Miami town hall meeting, she told citizens to remember that the Tea Party is the real enemy and that they hold Congress hostage. She expressed her belief that they have one goal in mind: ""to make President Obama a one-term president.""[12]
Wilson took a vocal stance on the killing of Trayvon Martin, who was a constituent of hers and whose family she says she has known all her life. She has been both praised and criticized for stating shortly after the killing that the motive of the accused, George Zimmerman, was racism. Her most repeated quote was ""Trayvon Was hunted down like a rabid dog. He was shot in the street."" She called for Zimmerman's arrest for his own safety.[13] For making this suggestion, she received criticism from conservative quarters. A Breitbart piece noted the only way somebody can be imprisoned for their own safety is if they are a threat to themselves. They cited that the Constitution ""expressly forbids such measures under the Fourth Amendment and the only excuse for a criminal arrest is probable cause.""[14]
In March 2012, Wilson said ""Justice must be served. No more racial profiling!""[15] She also went to the House floor and called for the ""murderer"" to be arrested, saying it was an ovious case of racial profiling.[16] Wilson organized a rally in Miami on April 1, 2012, calling for Zimmerman's imprisonment. She criticized Florida's self-defense gun law, the so-called Stand Your Ground law, in the wake of Martin's killing, sharing her sentiment that when new laws go on the books, and they work against the people, the laws ""should be looked at and repealed.""[17] In April 2012, Wilson said that the death of Martin was ""definitely"" murder.[18]
Concern had been raised about Wilson's outspoken comments, with some asking if her rhetoric was ""making it more difficult for the prosecutor to do her job.""[19] Wilson has been calling for tougher laws to prevent the racial profiling that led to Martin's death.[20]
Wilson led efforts to combat bullying and hazing both as the South Atlantic Regional Director for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and as a member of Congress.[21] A Miami Herald reporter nicknamed her ""The Haze Buster"" for her public stance against hazing. She was part of a coalition of African-American fraternity and sorority leaders who launched an anti-Hazing campaign after the 2011 death of Florida A&M drum major Robert Champion Jr.[22]
MSNBC's The Grio, an African-American news and opinion platform, named Wilson a The Grio 100 for 2012.[23]
Wilson is widowed. She has three children.[7] Wilson is an avid wearer of hats. She has a large collection that includes hundreds of hats of all different varieties. She wears one every day to honor her late grandmother. She has asked House Speaker John Boehner to waive the rule prohibiting the wearing of hats on the floor of the House of Representatives, a rule in place since 1837.[2]"
"111","","2003","1961","Florida 25","University of South Florida","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_D%C3%ADaz-Balart","Mario Daz-Balart","Republican","Florida Senate, Florida House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","Mario Rafael Daz-Balart Caballero (born September 25, 1961) is a Republican U.S. Representative from Florida. He has represented a district in the Miami area since 2003, currently numbered as the 25th district. His current district includes much of southwestern Miami-Dade County, including the city of Hialeah, as well as much of the northern portion of the Everglades.


Daz-Balart was born in Fort Lauderdale in 1961 to the late Cuban politician Rafael Daz-Balart. His aunt, Mirta Daz-Balart, was the first wife of Fidel Castro. Her son, and his cousin, is Fidel ngel ""Fidelito"" Castro Daz-Balart. His uncle is the Cuban-Spanish painter, Waldo Daz-Balart. His brother, Lincoln Daz-Balart, represented Florida's 21st District from 1993 to 2011. He has two other brothers, Jos Daz-Balart, a journalist, and Rafael Daz-Balart, a banker.
He attended the University of South Florida to study political science before beginning his public service career as an aide to then-Miami Mayor Xavier Surez in 1985. In the same year, he changed his political party affiliation from Democratic to Republican.[2]
He was elected to the Florida House in 1988 and moved to the Florida Senate in 1992. He returned to the Florida House in 2000. During his second tenure in the House, he chaired the redistricting committee.
Daz-Balart gave up his seat in the state house to run in the newly created 25th District, which included most of western Miami-Dade County, part of Collier County and the mainland portion of Monroe County. It was widely believed that he had drawn this district for himself, given that he was chairman of the state house redistricting committee. He easily won the seat with 64 percent of the vote. He was unopposed for reelection in 2004, and won a third term with 58 percent of the vote in 2006.
In 2008, however, Daz-Balart faced his strongest challenge to date in Joe Garca, former Executive Director of the Cuban American National Foundation and former chairman of the Miami-Dade County Democratic Party. Despite the perception that Daz-Balart had drawn the district for himself, it was actually fairly marginal on paper, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+4. Ultimately, Daz-Balart defeated Garcia with 53 percent of the vote.
On February 11, 2010, Daz-Balart announced his intention to seek election in Florida's 21st congressional districtbeing vacated by his brother, Rep. Lincoln Daz-Balartrather than the 25th district.[3] Unlike the 25th, the 21st has long been considered the most Republican district in the Miami area.
No other party even put up a candidate when filing closed on April 30, handing the seat to Mario Diaz-Balart.[4]
Daz-Balart was reelected unopposed in 2012 in the renumbered 25th district. Indeed, since this district's creation in 1993 (it was numbered as the 21st from 1993 to 2013), the Republican candidate has run unopposed in all but two elections.
Mario Daz-Balart's voting record is moderate to conservative. For his first two terms in Congress, Daz-Balart was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee.
He is a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, a caucus of Hispanic Republican congressmen. Like his Cuban-American colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Daz-Balart is a strong advocate of maintaining the Cuban embargo, saying ""Some people do not understand the embargo of Cuba. Its purpose is to keep American hard currency out of the hands of a Communist thug by restricting most trade and travel.""[5]
On September 29, 2008, Daz-Balart voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008[6]
He currently lives in Miami with his wife and son.

In 1989, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Cuban American and Latina elected to Congress. She was also the first Republican woman elected to the House from Florida, and is currently the most senior Republican woman in the U.S. House.[1] Ros-Lehtinen gave the first Republican response to the State of the Union address in Spanish in 2011, and gave the third in 2014.[2]
In September 2011, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican member of the U.S. Congress to co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act.[3] In July 2012, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican in the House to support same-sex marriage.[4] Also, she said she would propose legislation making U.S. funding for the UN contingent on extensive reform. Her bill will also call for the United States to withdraw from the UNHRC, as ""Israel is the only country on the council's permanent agenda, while abuses by rogue regimes like Cuba, China, and Syria are ignored"".[5]


Ileana Ros y Adato was born in Havana, Cuba, one of two children born to Enrique Ros, now a Cuban American businessman and anti-Fidel Castro activist, and his wife, Amanda Adato. The family emigrated to the United States when Ileana was seven years old. She received her Bachelor of Arts in education and her Master of Arts in educational leadership from Florida International University. She attended the University of Miami where she earned a Ph.D in higher education.[6]
Ros-Lehtinen was raised Catholic and is now an Episcopalian.[6][7] Ros-Lehtinen's maternal grandparents were Sephardic Jews, originally from the Ottoman Empire, who had been active in Cuba's Jewish community.[8] Her maternal grandfather left the city of Krklareli for Cuba in 1913, fleeing the devastation and economic collapse caused by the First Balkan War.[9] Her mother later converted to Catholicism to marry her father.[8][10]
Ros-Lehtinen was an educator and the owner/operator of a private school in Miami-Dade County.[11] She was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1982, where she met State Representative Dexter Lehtinen (D-Miami). They married on June 9, 1984, after Dexter switched parties. They both served in the State House until 1986. That year, they were both elected to the Florida Senate, where he was elected to District 40 and she was elected in District 34.[12][13] In 1988, Dexter Lehtinen resigned his seat to become U.S. Attorney of South Florida. In 1989, Ros-Lehtinen resigned her seat to become a U.S. Representative.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has two children, Rodrigo (born Amanda), a transgender LGBT rights activist, and Patricia Marie.[14] She is also step-mother to Katherine and Douglas Lehtinen.
After incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Claude Pepper died on May 30, 1989, there was a special election scheduled for August 29, 1989. State Senator Ros-Lehtinen defeated Democrat Gerald Richman 53%-47%.[15] She was the first Cuban American elected to the United States Congress and the first Republican woman elected from Florida. Ros-Lehtinen was unaware that she was also the first Latina elected to Congress until after she was elected.[1] In 1990, she won re-election to a full term with 60% of the vote.[16] In total, she has been elected to ten full terms, never winning with less than 58%.[17]
Ros-Lehtinen joined Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) on a Congressional delegation to the United Nations in order to encourage international support for an end to the genocide in Darfur. In addition, when Ros-Lehtinen returned from a trip to Darfur in April 2007 where she visited Sudanese refugee camps, she strongly encouraged the United States and the international community to find a solution to this humanitarian crisis.[18][19]
Following the 2008 elections, then President-elect Barack Obama rang Ros-Lehtinen to congratulate her on her re-election. She hung up on him, believing that it was a prank call from a radio station. She did the same to Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel when he rang to confirm the original call was genuine, and only accepted the call after Congressman Howard Berman managed to speak to her.[20][21]
Ros-Lehtinen played a key role in keeping the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010 from being passed into law.[22] Although the bill had unanimously passed the Senate with bipartisan support, she persuaded enough Republicans in the House to vote against the bill so that it did not receive the required two-thirds majority. She reportedly invoked concerns about the legislation's cost and that funds could be used to promote abortion.[23]
Ros-Lehtinen served as Chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 2011-2013. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, she expressed support of the Libyan opposition; on February 26, 2011, she released a press release which stated, ""stronger penalties must be imposed in order to hold the regime accountable for its heinous crimes, and to prevent further violence against the Libyan people"". But on March 20, 2011, the day after the NATO strikes to enforce the no-fly-zone began, she expressed a different view in a press release: ""I am concerned that the President has yet to clearly define for the American people what vital United States security interests he believes are currently at stake in Libya.""[24] The congresswoman has also been a forerunner in cutting U.S. aid to foreign lands, including the State Department, The Peace Corps, the Asia Foundation, the U.S. Institute of Peace and the East-West Center. She also advocates cutting funding to Lebanese Armed Forces and the West Bank and Gaza.[25]
After comments by State Department over Israeli settlements, she demanded that the Obama administration halt its ""condemnations"" of ""an indispensable ally and friend of the United States."" In September 2011, she introduced a bill to cut off US funding to any UN organization that recognises Palestinian statehood.[26]
Ros-Lehtinen has been an opponent of funding for the Peace Corps. In 2011, she led a hearing about the perils that volunteers faced and the lack of concern for victims of sexual abuse while serving.[27] Ros-Lehtinen pressured the State Department to accelerate its processing of passports, something that had hindered American citizens' travel during the crucial summer travel season. Calling the delay ""outrageous, incomprehensible, unconscionable"" at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she is Chairwoman, Ros-Lehtinen brought the pressure of committee Republicans to bear on the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs and spur them to action.[28]
On May 7, 2014, Ros-Lehtinen introduced the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act (H.R. 4587; 113th Congress) in the House. The bill would impose sanctions against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support civil society in that country.[29] The sanctions would be directed at any government official who was involved in the mistreatment of protestors.[30] Ros-Lehtinen said that the bill was to ""condemn the ongoing human rights abuses being committed in Venezuela, and to answer the cries of the people of Venezuela.""[30] Ros-Lehtinen also said that she was ""pleased that the House of Representatives has acted to punish the thugs of the Maduro regime for brutally repressing and violating the human rights of those seeking to exercise their basic freedoms of speech and assembly in Venezuela.""[31]
A major individual campaign contributor to Ros-Lehtinen is Irving Moskowitz, a funder of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.[32] The lobby group J Street has called on Ros-Lehtinen to return campaign contributions from Moskowitz, saying he ""actively undermines the two-state solution and the foreign policy of the United States by funding illegal settlements in the occupied territories"".[33][34] American Council on World Jewry president Jack Rosen has ""great concern""[35] about this demand.
Ros-Lehtinen is considered conservative on foreign and economic policy. Ros-Lehtinen supported President George W. Bush's surge policy in Iraq, a supports of Israel and supports continued sanctions against Cuba. She also supported the de facto government in Honduras, headed by Roberto Micheletti, that emerged after the military coup against President Manuel Zelaya. She has said of the decision to invade Iraq: ""Whether or not there is a direct link to the World Trade Center does not mean that Iraq is not meritorious of shedding blood. The common link is that they hate America."" [36]
On November 23, 2010, she called on the Obama administration to ""announce publicly, right now, that we will stay away from Durban III, deny it US taxpayer dollars, and oppose all measures that seek to facilitate it. And we should encourage other responsible nations to do the same.""[37]
Ros-Lehtinen opposes US support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East[26] and the Palestinian Authority. She describes herself as a ""strong supporter of Israel"" and regards the U.S. relationship with Israel as ""critical to the national security interests of both nations"".[38]
Ros-Lehtinen plays a prominent role in the Cuban-American lobby, which puts pressure on the Cuban government to bring about political change in Cuba. She is a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. Ros-Lehtinen also advances strongly held views on Cuba, and has lobbied against ending the United States embargo against that country. In 2004 she formed the Cuba Democracy Group aimed at curtailing U.S. agriculture exports and preventing U.S. banks from doing business with the Cuban government.[39]
Ros-Lehtinen has defended former fugitive Velentin Hernndez, convicted of murdering Luciano Nieves, a fellow Cuban exile who supported negotiations with the Cuban government,[40] In the 1980s, Ros-Lehtinen lobbied for the release and pardon of Cuban exile Orlando Bosch, who had been convicted of terrorist acts and has also been accused of involvement in the 1976 bombing of Cubana Flight 455, which killed 73 people, helping organize an ""Orlando Bosch day"" to gain support for his release.[41][42][43] Ros-Lehtinen played a prominent role in the unsuccessful attempt by relatives of Elian Gonzalez to gain custody of six-year-old from the Castro regime, describing Cuba as ""that system of godless communism"".[44] She also attempted to block Jimmy Carter's visit to the island in 2002.[45][46]
Ros-Lehtinen has stirred controversy by calling for the assassination of Cuban Leader Fidel Castro. She appeared in a British documentary, which was entitled 638 Ways to Kill Castro, saying: ""I welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing the people."" After a 28-second clip began circulating on the Internet, she claimed the filmmakers spliced clips together to get the sound bite. Twenty-four hours after the controversy erupted, director Dollan Cannell sent unedited tapes of his interview with Ros-Lehtinen to reporters.[47] The uncut version contradicted her response, showing she had twice welcomed an attempt on Castro's life. Although she attempted to distance herself from her denial, filmmaker Cannell requested an apology.[48]
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has been a notable Republican voice in favor of LGBT rights. In a Winter 2013 interview with the Human Rights Campaign, she stated that her support for same-sex marriage was based on ""coming from Cuba, losing my homeland to communism, seeing the state control everything  Im a person that believes in individual liberties and not having the government control everything. When asked about her support for her son Rodrigo, a transgender LGBT rights advocate, Ros-Lehtinen commented that:
Its important for families to support their children and to support their childrens choices. Its important to listen to your children, accept your children and have your children know that you love them unconditionally. Its not I love you, buttheres no but. Its just I love you.  To do otherwise isyoure hurting yourself, youre going to shun your child or grandchild. Youre going to say, No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. Im right and everything else is wrong. And thats a lonely way to live. It just means youll be out of that persons life, and who wants to be cut out of their childs life?[1]
Although Ros-Lehtinen voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996,[49] she began to support LGBT issues over the following decade. Her district includes large LGBT populations in South Beach in Miami Beach and in the Florida Keys. She was one of three Republican members of the LGBT Equality Caucus, of which she is a founding member and a vice-chairperson. While she is not a co-sponsor of the Uniting American Families Act, she supports anti-hate crime laws, anti-discrimination bills, believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, is a sponsor of the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, and voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment.[50] Ros-Lehtinen was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, and was the first Republican cosponsor of the bill.[1][51][52] In September 2011, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican member of the U.S. Congress to co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage Act, and signed on to a letter to IRS Commissioner Schulman requesting that the IRS provide clear guidance for LGBT taxpayers.[3][53] The letter asks the IRS to ensure that tax law is being applied fairly to all individuals. In July 2012, she became the first Republican in the House to fully support same-sex marriage.[54] In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[55]
Among Ros-Lehtinen's other conservative views include votes against the estate tax, voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, for fuel efficiency standards on autos, drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, support of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, votes in favor of making the Patriot Act permanent, support of the Military Commissions Act, votes against funding for stem cell research, and votes against SCHIP. She signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[56]
Ros-Lehtinen voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in its initial September 29, 2008 vote, which failed,[57] but voted in favor of the revised bill in its October 3, 2008 vote, which passed.[58]"

Buddy Carter graduated from Robert W. Groves High School in 1975. He earned an associate degree from Young Harris College in 1977 and a Bachelor of Science in pharmacy from the University of Georgia in 1980.
Buddy Carter served on the planning and zoning commission for the city of Pooler from 19891993 and on Pooler's city council from 19941995. Carter served as Pooler's mayor from 19962004 as well.

In March 2014, a controversy emerged regarding S.B. 408, a bill authored by Buddy Carter in the Georgia Senate that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies in Georgia. As he is the owner of three pharmacies which would see increased profits as a result of the proposed action, his vote was considered by many to be in violation of the ethical guidelines of the State Senate. ""Obviously, it's borderline,"" he admitted when questioned afterwards. [5]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is located in the southwestern part of the state and includes Albany, Thomasville and most of Columbus and Macon.


Bishop was born in Mobile, Alabama to Minnie B. Slade and Sanford Dixon Bishop,[1] who was the first president of Bishop State Community College. He was educated at Morehouse College and Emory University School of Law, and served in the United States Army.[2] While at Morehouse, he was a classmate of Herman Cain. After receiving his honorable discharge, Bishop operated a law firm in Columbus, Georgia.
He has received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), given to Eagle Scouts for distinguished career achievement.[3][4] He is a member of BSA's Order of the Arrow (OA) and as a youth was on the OA ceremonies team.[3] He is a resident of Albany, Georgia, where he is a member of the Mount Zion Baptist Church. Bishop is a Life Member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity initiated at Morehouse College's Pi chapter.[5] Bishop is a Shriner and 33 Mason.[6]
In October 2013, Bishop announced he was diagnosed as having lymph node cancer after discovering a lump in near the base of his neck. By January 2014, Bishop said that he was cancer free.[7][8]
He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1977, where he remained until being elected to the Georgia Senate in 1990.
After only one term in the state senate, he ran for the 2nd District in 1992, which was held by six-term U.S. Congressman Charles Hatcher, a white moderate Democrat. The 2nd had been reconfigured as a black-majority district during congressional apportionment following the 1990 Census. Bishop finished second behind Hatcher in a crowded six-way primary. Hatcher failed to reach the 50% threshold, and was forced into a runoff election. During the campaign Bishop attacked Hatcher for bouncing 819 checks in the House banking scandal. Bishop defeated him 53%-47%.[9] In the general election, he defeated Republican Jim Dudley 64%-36%.[10]
In the Democratic primary, he defeated James Bush 67%-33%.[11] In the general election, he won re-election to a second term with 66%.[12]
In 1995, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the redistricting of Georgia had violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The 2nd district was thus redrawn. The newly redrawn district was 60% white. Nonetheless he won re-election to a third term with 54% of the vote.[13]
Bishop won re-election to a fourth term against Republican Joseph F. McCormick with 57% of the vote.[14] During the campaign, Bishop received twice the campaign financing that his opponent raised. [15][16]
Bishop defeated Dylan Glenn, a young black Republican who received strong backing from many national Republican leaders. The vote was 53%-47%.[17]
Bishop won re-election to a sixth term unopposed.[18]
Bishop won re-election to a seventh term with 67% of the vote.[19]
He won re-election to an eighth term with 68% of the vote.[20]
Bishop won re-election to a ninth term with 69% of the vote.[21]
Bishop won re-election to a tenth term against Republican State Representative Mike Keown, 51%-49%,[22] the closest margin of his career. In a year where the Democrats lost the majority in the house, the New York Times noted that Bishop's re-election possibilities seemed slim as an ""incumbent in an anti-Washington year"", his identity as a black man in a majority white district (49% White,47% Black), and the scholarship scandal surrounding his non-profit.[23]
After redistricting, the 2nd district has once again become a black majority district. Notably, it added most of Macon, previously the heart of the 8th District. Bishop was heavily favored in the general election as a result.[24] As expected, he defeated Republican John House with 63 percent of the vote.
Bishop is one of the more conservative black Democrats in the House. He is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as the Blue Dog Democrats, a group of moderate to conservative House Democrats. Serving a primarily agricultural district, Bishop has fought to preserve the federal price supports for peanuts, southwest Georgia's most important crop. The New York Times quoted Mr. Adams, chairman of the agency that administers Federal farm programs in Georgia saying ""It's questionable whether it would have survived without the votes he brought to it"".[25] In 1997, he caused considerable controversy within his own party by cosponsoring a bill by U.S. Representative Ernest Istook (R-Oklahoma) to introduce a constitutional amendment to protect religious expression on public property, known as the H. J. Res, 78, the Religious Freedom Amendment. The specific wording of the amendment allowing the practice of religion on public property, most notably public schools, reads as follows:
""To secure the people's fight to acknowledge God according to the dictates of conscience: The people's right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage and traditions shall not be infringed. The Government shall not require any person to join in prayer or other religious activity, prescribe school prayers, discriminate- against religion, or deny equal access to a benefit on account of religion...The people's right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, or traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be infringed.""[26]
On October 10, 2002, Sanford Bishop was one of only four of 36 Congressional Black Caucus members who voted for the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War. The other three Congressional Black Caucus members who voted for the resolution authorizing the Iraq War are no longer members of Congress: Bill Jefferson of Louisiana, Albert Wynn of Maryland, and Harold Ford, Jr. of Tennessee.[27][28][29]
On September 10, 2007, Sanford Bishop endorsed Barack Obama for President and was co-chair of Georgia for Obama campaign; Bishop's wife, Vivian Creighton Bishop, a municipal court clerk in Columbus, was co-chair of the Georgia Women for Hillary committee.[30] However, he joined with other pro-life Democrats who voted no on President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because of wording in the bill that permits federal funding for Abortions.[31]
In September, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Bishop had, in 2003, directed scholarships funded by the Congressional Black Caucus to ineligible persons, including his stepdaughter, Aayesha Owens Reese, his niece Emmaundia J. Whitaker and other people with close ties to the family. Tim Turner, the congressman's spokesman said the congressman would repay the scholarship fund for any awards he made in violation of the rules.[32] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington mentioned Bishop in its annual Most Corrupt Members of Congress report in 2011.[33]
In 1997, the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit came out of legislative discrimination of black farmers, the case was led by Timothy Pigford and 400 black farmers. The Washington Times reported that by the end of the case in 1999, over 94,000 claims were filed in conjuncture with the original case, ""even though the U.S. Census Bureau never counted more than 33,000 black farmers in America during the years in question.""[34] In 2007, then Senator Barack Obama passed legislation to increase the amount of money given via Pigford II. Since then reports from multiple news sources have reported on the growing reports of fraud within the program. In February 2011, three farmers brought these allegations of fraud to Mr. Bishop, including Eddie Slaughter, vice president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, Bishop responded with ""yes, I am aware that there is fraud in the program, that's why anti-fraud provisions were written into the settlement...It's not my job to monitor fraud in the program.""[34][35] Interviews with Mr. Slaughter have circulated the internet and criticism has been raised regarding his comments about fraud allegations leading the end of the program.[36]"
"116","","2003","1950","Georgia 3","Georgia State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Westmoreland","Lynn Westmoreland","Republican","Georgia House of Representatives","Baptist - SBC","Leon Acton ""Lynn"" Westmoreland (born April 2, 1950) is the U.S. Representative for Georgia's 3rd congressional district, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district stretches from the far southern Atlanta suburbs to the suburbs of Columbus. He previously represented Georgia's 8th congressional district from 2005 to 2007.


Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Margaret Ferrell (ne Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland.[1] He grew up in metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended Georgia State University, but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the U.S. House in 2005.
As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan gerrymandering during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005 after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections.[2][3][4]
During his first term in the 109th United States Congress, Westmoreland was appointed to the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, and the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.[citation needed]. In January of 2015, the House Intelligence Committee was reorganized, and a subcommittee on Cybersecurity and the National Security Agency was created with Westmoreland appointed to be the subcommittee's first chairman.[5]
As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the Ten Commandments in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Westmoreland also sponsored a bill that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in courthouses in a historical setting.[6] In May 2006, political humorist Stephen Colbert interviewed Westmoreland for The Colbert Report show segment Better Know a District, and during the interview, asked Westmoreland to name the Ten Commandments. The edited interview showed Westmoreland being able to name only three of them, but his press secretary later said that he had named seven of the ten.[7][8] Govtrack.us ranked Westmoreland as tied for the most conservative member of the 112th Congress
Westmoreland led a group of congressmen who opposed the 2006 renewal of certain provisions in the Voting Rights Act that require nine Southern states and a number of counties (mostly in the South) to obtain Federal permission for certain changes to election law or changes in venue. Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting. Despite Westmoreland's objections, a strong bipartisan majority renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years without changes.[9]
In 2008, Westmoreland ran unopposed in the Republican primary and was re-elected after defeating his Democratic opponent Stephen Camp.[10] After his win, Westmoreland announced that he was considering running for the office of Governor of Georgia in 2010,[11] but later indicated in an April 2009 press release that he would not.[12]
In 2010 Westmoreland signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[13]
Westmoreland has sponsored ten bills of his own, including:[14]
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his wife Michelle as ""uppity,"" a pejorative considered by some as historically used to describe African-Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress.[15] He told reporters: ""Just from what little Ive seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity,"" Westmoreland said. Asked to clarify that he used the word ""uppity,"" Westmoreland said, ""Uppity, yeah.""[16][17]
The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: ""Ive never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteemsnobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up.""[18]
Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was tantamount to election in November. He routed his Democratic opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. He was handily reelected in 2006 after his district was renumbered as the 3rd and made even more Republican than before.
He resides in Grantville, Georgia, with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren."

The district is based in DeKalb County, a largely suburban county east of Atlanta. It also includes portions of Gwinnett, Newton, and all of Rockdale counties;[1] the district's boundaries have been redrawn, in accordance with the results of the 2010 United States Census, since Congressman Johnson's initial election victory in 2006.[2] He is one of only three Buddhists, the others being Hawaii's Mazie Hirono and Colleen Hanabusa, to serve in the United States Congress.[3]


Johnson grew up in Washington, D.C. His father worked for the Bureau of Prisons and was the director of classifications and paroles. Up to that time, he was the highest ranking African American in the bureau.[4]
Johnson graduated from Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University) in 1976, was a member of Omega Psi Phi Kappa Alpha Alpha Chapter, Decatur, Georgia, and Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law in Houston in 1979; he practiced law in Decatur, Georgia, for more than 25 years.
He was elected to the DeKalb County Commission in 2000 and served two terms. Prior to his service on the Commission, he worked as an Associate Magistrate Judge for ten years.[5]
In 2008, Johnson was elected to serve as regional whip for Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.[6]
On November 18, 2008, Johnson was elected Regional Whip for the Eighth Region (GA, FL, MS, AL, U.S. Virgin Islands) by the Democratic Caucus.[6]
On January 25, 2007, Johnson responded to U.S. President George W. Bush's State of the Union address by criticizing the war in Iraq, saying ""This war has proven to be one of the gravest missteps in the recent history of our country. It is time for President Bush to face the music and respond to the urgent demands of a frustrated country.""[7]
On February 8, 2007, Johnson introduced his first bill: a resolution requesting that the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates take U.S. troops off of street patrol duty in Iraq. ""There is no military solution for the civil war in Iraq,"" said Johnson, ""It is time for Iraqi troops, who have been trained, to assume responsibility for patrolling their own streets. Clearly, deploying our troops this way has only escalated the number of U.S. casualties, and this must stop"".[8] According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Johnson's resolution was ""interesting in that it goes beyond broad directives and proposes something very specific"".[9]
On March 23, 2007, Johnson voted to pass H.R. 1591, the ""U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007"". Amongst many other provisions, this bill provided $124 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and required that President Bush withdraw American forces from Iraq by mid-2008; it additionally prohibited the use of funds offered under the act to deploy any troops to Iraq unless the military has certified to congressional appropriators in advance that the military unit is fully mission-capable (while authorizing the president to waive the prohibition and deployment limits on a unit-by-unit basis for reasons of national security). The proposed bill also set requirements for Department of Homeland Security contracts, subcontracts and task orders, and required that each federal agency that had awarded at least $1 billion worth of contracts in the preceding fiscal year develop and implement a plan to minimize the use of no-bid and cost-reimbursement contracts; provided funds for disaster relief and recovery related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, for influenza pandemic response programs, for livestock disaster assistance, and made appropriations to bolster Medicare and Medicaid; it amended fair labor laws to phase-in an increase of the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour and applied these wage requirements to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and to American Samoa; addressed several tax issues by including tax breaks for small businesses, making certain dependents ineligible for the lowest capital gains rate, and lengthening the period of failure to notify a taxpayer of liability before interest and certain penalties must be suspended. The measure also increased the amount of any required installment of estimated tax otherwise due in 2012 from a corporation with assets of $1 billion or more.[10] Johnson attracted attention by blogging about his decision to vote for the bill.[11] H.R. 1591 passed the House on 23 March 2007, and the Senate on 26 April, but President Bush, citing[12] the Iraqi withdrawal timeline incorporated among the many particulars as being unacceptable, vetoed the bill on 1 May 2007; Congress tried to override the veto the next day, but proved unable to do so.[13]
On May 24, 2007, Johnson voted to cut funding for the Iraq War unless provisions included binding requirements upon the Iraqi government and provisions were additionally made for the redeployment of American armed forces from Iraq.[14]
Johnson voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout bill in November 2008.
He voted in favor of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus package supported by Democrats in Congress and President Barack Obama.
In 2007, Johnson's H.Con.Res.80, a resolution calling for peaceful resolution to the Ugandan civil war between the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army, unanimously passed the House and Senate. Johnson's first successful piece of legislation, it was jointly introduced in the Senate by Democratic Senator Russ Feingold and Republican Senator Sam Brownback.
In 2009, Johnson demanded censure of Rep. Joe Wilson following Wilson's ""you lie"" exclamation during President Obama's speech, delivered to a joint session of the 111th United States Congress on September 9, 2009, concerning his plan for health care reform; Congressman Johnson argued that the comment had an unseen racial undertone and that, if Wilson was not formally rebuked, ""we will have people with white hoods running through the countryside again"".[15]
During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on March 25, 2010[16] concerning the U.S. military installation on the island of Guam, Johnson said to Admiral Robert F. Willard, Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, ""My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize"", to which Admiral Willard replied, ""We don't anticipate that.""[17][18] Johnson's office later said Johnson ""is simply a tremendous deadpan"" and that he was using a facetious metaphor.[19]
In 2014, Johnson was named the 18th most effective Democrat in the 112th Congress [out of 204 Democratic members] according to a new study by Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia (UVA).[20] He was also ranked higher than any of his Republican colleagues from Georgia. The study judged effectiveness by looking at a lawmakers proven ability to advance a members agenda items through the legislative process and into law. The scorecard looked at the number of bills a member introduced or sponsored; the significance of the bills; and how far each made it in the legislative process. [21]
In 2006, Johnson challenged Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney in the Democratic primary for the 4th Districtthe real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. He forced McKinney into a runoff by holding her under 50% in the July 18, 2006 Democratic primary: McKinney got 47.1% of the vote; Johnson 44.4%, and a third candidate got 8.5%.[22]
In the runoff of August 8, 2006, although there were about 8,000 more voters, McKinney got about the same number of votes as in the July primary. Johnson won with 41,178 votes (59%); McKinney got 28,832 (41%).[23]
In November, he trounced the Republican candidate, Catherine Davis, with 76% of the voteone of the largest percentages for a Democrat in a contested election, and the largest in the history of the district. However, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary. The 4th is one of the most Democratic districts in the South; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+22 at the time of the election, it was the second-most Democratic district in Georgia (only the neighboring 5th is more Democratic).
On October 6, 2006, Congressional Quarterly's ""On Their Way,"" which features promising candidates soon-to-arrive in Washington, featured Johnson.[24]
Johnson's aggressive use of the internet to court supporters and attract national attention to his primary challenge agasinst McKinney. The National Journal wrote that of all Congressional candidates nationwide in 2006, ""Johnson had the most unique blog strategy by far.""[25] The National Journal ranked Johnson's use of the internet to defeat McKinneyand the broader trend of challengers using the blogosphere to challenge entrenched incumbentsas the third most significant blog-related story of 2006.[26] Johnson was the first Congressional candidate invited to blog[citation needed] for The Hill's Congress Blog, typically reserved for Members of Congress.[27] ""I'm tremendously excited about the opportunity to use this unique medium to strengthen democracy by increasing open interaction between constituents and candidates,"" Johnson wrote. ""I hope to provide you with an inside view of this hotly-contested, high stakes runoff.""
Johnson was unopposed for reelection in 2008, winning 99.9% of the vote against write-in candidates Loren Christopher Collins, Faye Coffield and Jacob Perasso.
Johnson was the first Democratic congressman in Georgia to publicly endorse Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary on July 30, 2007.[28]
Johnson won reelection over the Republican candidate, business owner Liz Carter, gaining 131,760 of 176,467 votes, or 74.67% of the total. Carter, who is white, made headlines during the campaign by maintaining that she had been initially barred from appearing at a candidate forum hosted by Newsmakers Journal due to her race, an assertion subsequently denied in a statement by the forum's organizers.[29]
Johnson's wife, Mereda Davis Johnson, is an attorney; they have two children.[citation needed]
In December 2009, Johnson revealed that he had been battling Hepatitis C (HCV) for over a decade, which resulted in slow speech and a tendency to regularly get ""lost in thought in the middle of a discussion"".[30] Johnson said that he learned he had the disease in 1998 but did not know how he contracted it. HCV-induced liver dysfunction often leads to Hepatic encephalopathy, a cause of confusion. Symptoms are often reversible with treatment.[31] The disease damaged his liver and led to thyroid problems.[30] He was treated with a combination of ribavirin and interferon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[30] In February 2010, Johnson successfully completed an experimental treatment for Hepatitis C, which resulted in restored mental acuity, weight gain and increased energy.[32]"

He is the U.S. Representative for Georgia's 5th congressional district, serving since 1987, and is the dean of the Georgia congressional delegation. The district includes the northern three-quarters of Atlanta.
Lewis is the only living ""Big Six"" leader of the American Civil Rights Movement, having been the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), playing a key role in the struggle to end legalized racial discrimination and segregation. A member of the Democratic Party, Lewis is a member of the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives and has served in the Whip organization since shortly after his first election to the U.S. Congress.
He is Senior Chief Deputy Whip, leading an organization of chief deputy whips and serves as the primary assistant to the Democratic Whip. He has held this position since 2007 and been on the whip team since 1991.


Lewis was born in Troy, Alabama, the third son of Willie Mae (ne Carter) and Eddie Lewis.[1] His parents were sharecroppers.[2] Lewis grew up in Pike County, Alabama. He also has a deaf brother named Edward. He has other siblings, including brothers Grant, Freddie, Sammy, Adolph, and William, and sisters named Ethel, Rosa, and Ora. He survived a tornado at the age of four with fourteen cousins. Lewis had only seen two white people in his life until age six.[3] Lewis was educated at the Pike County Training High School, Brundidge, Alabama, and also American Baptist Theological Seminary and at Fisk University, both in Nashville, Tennessee, where he became a leader in the Nashville sit-ins. While a student, he was invited to attend non-violence workshops held in the basement of Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev. James Lawson and Rev. Kelly Miller Smith. There he became a dedicated adherent to the discipline and philosophy of non-violence, which he still practices today. The Nashville sit-in movement was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Lewis was arrested and jailed many times in the struggle to desegregate the downtown area of the city. Afterwards, he participated in the Freedom Rides sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality or CORE, led by James Farmer and ultimately became a national leader in the struggle for civil rights and respect for human dignity.[2] In an interview, John Lewis said ""I saw racial discrimination as a young child. I saw those signs that said 'White Men, Colored Men, White Women, Colored Women'. ... I remember as a young child with some of my brothers and sisters and first cousins going down to the public library trying to get library cards, trying to check some books out, and we were told by the librarian that the library was for whites only and not for 'coloreds'."" During a rather dangerous childhood trip to Buffalo, NY, John saw for the first time black men and white men working together, unsegregated water fountains, and for the first time, John began to believe the dream of equality was more than just a dream. Lewis followed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and Rosa Parks on the radio. He and his family supported the Montgomery Bus Boycott.[citation needed]
John Lewis was the youngest of the Big Six civil rights leaders and the chairman of the SNCC from 1963 to 1966, some of the most tumultuous years of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. During his tenure, SNCC opened Freedom Schools, launched the Mississippi Freedom Summer, and organized the voter registration efforts that led to the pivotal Selma to Montgomery marches. As the chairman of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality. It also did not provide African Americans the right to vote.
He graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville and then received a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University. As a student, Lewis was very dedicated to the civil rights movement. He organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the Nashville Student Movement. He was instrumental in organizing student sit-ins, bus boycotts and nonviolent protests in the fight for voter and racial equality.
In 1960, Lewis became one of the 13 original Freedom Riders. There were seven whites and six blacks who were determined to ride from Washington, DC, to New Orleans in an integrated fashion. At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and revived by Farmer and CORE, was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in Boynton v. Virginia (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. In the South, Lewis and other non-violent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs, arrested at times and taken to jail. When CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist Diane Nash arranged for the Nashville students to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.
In 1963, when Chuck McDew stepped down as SNCC chairman, Lewis, one of the founding members of SNCC, was quickly elected to take over. Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and non-violence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966.
By 1963, as chairman of SNCC, he was named one of the ""Big Six"" leaders who were organizing the March on Washington, along with Whitney Young, A. Phillip Randolph, James Farmer and Roy Wilkins. The occasion of Dr. King's celebrated ""I Have a Dream"" speech, Lewis also spoke at the March and is its last remaining living speaker. At 23 he was the youngest speaker that day.[4]
In 1964, Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for ""Mississippi Freedom Summer,"" a campaign to register black voters across the South. The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the Selma to Montgomery marches. On March 7, 1965  a day that would become known as ""Bloody Sunday""  Lewis and fellow activist Hosea Williams led over 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. At the end of the bridge, they were met by Alabama State Troopers who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged tear gas and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge to Brown Chapel, the movement's headquarter church in Selma. Before Lewis could be taken to the hospital he appeared before the television cameras calling on President Johnson to intervene in Alabama. Lewis bears scars from the incident on his head that are still visible today.
Historian Howard Zinn wrote: ""At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the Kennedy Administration. But Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had experienced, again and again, the strange passivity of the national government in the face of Southern violence.""[5]
""John Lewis and SNCC had reason to be angry. At 21 years old, John Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in Rock Hill, South Carolina. He tried to enter a whites-only waiting room and two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Nevertheless, only two weeks later Lewis joined a Freedom Ride that was bound for Jackson. ""We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back,"" Lewis said recently in regard to his perseverance following the act of violence.[6]
In an interview with CNN during the 40th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Lewis recounted the sheer amount of violence he and the 12 other original Freedom Riders endured. In Anniston, Alabama, the bus was fire-bombed after Ku Klux Klan members deflated its tires, forcing it to come to a stop. In Birmingham, the Riders were mercilessly beaten, and in Montgomery, an angry mob met the bus, and Lewis was hit in the head with a wooden crate. ""It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious,"" said Lewis, remembering the incident.
The original intent of the Freedom Rides was to test the new law that banned segregation in public transportation. It also exposed the passivity of the government regarding violence against citizens of the country who were simply acting in accordance to the law.[7] The federal government had trusted the notoriously racist Alabama police to protect the Riders, but did nothing itself, except to have FBI agents take notes. The Kennedy Administration then called for a ""cooling-off period"", a moratorium on Freedom Rides.[5] Lewis had been imprisoned for forty days in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Sunflower County, Mississippi, after participating in a Freedom Riders activity in that state.[8]
In February 2009, forty-eight years after he had been bloodied by the Ku Klux Klan during civil rights marches, Lewis received an apology on national television from a white southerner, former Klansman Elwin Wilson.[9][10]
After leaving SNCC in 1966, Lewis worked with community organizations and was named community affairs director for the National Consumer Co-op Bank in Atlanta.
Before being elected to Atlanta City Council in 1981, Lewis faced ""years of criticism as a holier-than-thou publicity seeker who challenged city leaders on ethical matters"".[11] In the context of the ""war on drugs"", Lewis challenged Julian Bond to take a urine drug test during the 1986 Democratic runoff.[12] The Houston Chronicle called it ""perhaps the best-known example"" of congressional candidates challenging their opponents to drug testing.[12] The challenge could have served in Lewis' favor in his upset win as ""there were signs that it may have damaged Bond among older black voters concerned about drug abuse among blacks"".[12]
Lewis first ran for elective office in 1977, when a vacancy occurred in Georgia's 5th congressional district. A special election was called after President Jimmy Carter appointed incumbent U.S. Congressman Andrew Young to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Lewis lost the race to Atlanta City Councilman and future U.S. Senator Wyche Fowler.
After his unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1977, Lewis was without a job and in debt from his campaign. He accepted a position with the Carter administration as associate director of ACTION, responsible for running the VISTA program, the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, and the Foster Grandparent Program. He held that job for two and a half years, resigning as the 1980 election approached.[13] In 1981, Lewis was elected to the Atlanta City Council.
In January 1977, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Andrew Young, of Georgia's 5th congressional district, decided to resign in order to become the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under President Jimmy Carter. In the March 1977 open primary, Atlanta City Councilman Wyche Fowler, Jr. ranked first with 40% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Lewis ranked second with 29% of the vote.[14] In the April election, Fowler defeated Lewis 62%38%.[15]
After nine years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Fowler gave up the seat to make a successful run for the U.S. Senate. Lewis decided to run for the 5th district again. In the August Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority districtState Representative Julian Bond ranked first with 47%, just three points shy of winning outright. Lewis earned 35% in second place.[16] In the run-off, Lewis pulled an upset against Bond, defeating him 52%48%.[17] In the November general election, he defeated Republican Portia Scott 75%25%.[18]
John Lewis has been reelected 14 times. He has dropped below 70 percent of the vote only once. In 1994, he defeated Republican Dale Dixon by a 38 point margin, 69%31%.[19] He even ran unopposed in 1996 and from 2004 to 2008.
He was challenged in the Democratic primary just twice: in 1992 and 2008. In 1992, he defeated State Representative Mable Thomas 76%24%.[20] In 2008, Thomas decided to challenge Lewis again, as well as the Reverend Markel Hutchins. Lewis defeated Hutchins and Thomas 69%16%-15%.[21]
On May 5, 2014, Lewis delivered the keynote address at the commencement exercises for the School of Visual Arts (SVA), urging the graduating artists to use their talents to fight injustice, saying, ""You have a mandate to get out and disturb the order of things.""[22] SVA honored Lewis with an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts.[23]
Lewis represents Georgia's 5th Congressional District, one of the most consistently Democratic districts in the nation. Since its formalization in 1845, the district has been represented by a non-Democrat for just 11 years. The last non-Democrat to represent the district was Republican Fletcher Thompson, who left office Jan. 3, 1973 after a six-year stint; prior to Thompson, Democrats had held the district since James C. Freeman relinquished the seat in 1875 after serving a single two-year term.
Lewis is one of the most liberal members of the House, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent a district in the Deep South. He has been labeled a ""far-left Democratic leader"" by GovTrack and a ""Hard-Core Liberal"" by Issues2000.[24][25] The Washington Post described Lewis in 1998 as ""a fiercely partisan Democrat but ... also fiercely independent.""[26] Lewis characterized himself as a strong and adamant liberal.[26] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Lewis was the ""only former major civil rights leader who extended his fight for human rights and racial reconciliation to the halls of Congress"".[11] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also said that to ""those who know him, from U.S. senators to 20-something congressional aides"", he is called the ""conscience of Congress"".[11] Lewis has cited former Florida Senator and Congressman Claude Pepper, a staunch liberal, as being the colleague that he has most admired.[27] Lewis has spoken out in support of gay rights and national health insurance,[26] and he has worked with the Faith and Politics Institute to advance their goals.[28]
Lewis opposed the U.S. waging of the 1991 Gulf War,[29] NAFTA,[30] and the 2000 trade agreement with China that passed the House.[31] Lewis opposed the Clinton administration on NAFTA and welfare reform.[26] After welfare reform passed, Lewis was described as outraged; he said, ""Where is the sense of decency? What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose its soul?""[32] In 1994, when Clinton was considering invading Haiti, Lewis, in contrast to the Congressional Black Caucus as a whole, opposed armed intervention.[33] When Clinton did send troops to Haiti, Lewis called for supporting the troops and called the intervention a ""mission of peace"".[34] In 1998, when Clinton was considering a military strike against Iraq, Lewis said he would back the president if American forces were ordered into action.[35] In 2001, three days after the September 11 attacks, Lewis voted to give Bush authority to retaliate in a vote that was 4201; Lewis called it probably one of his toughest votes.[28] In 2002, he sponsored the Peace Tax Fund bill, a conscientious objection to military taxation initiative that had been reintroduced yearly since 1972.[36] Lewis was a ""fierce partisan critic of President Bush"" and the Iraq war.[11] The Associated Press said he was ""the first major House figure to suggest impeaching George W. Bush,"" arguing that the president ""deliberately, systematically violated the law"" in authorizing the National Security Agency to conduct wiretaps without a warrant. Lewis said, ""He is not King, he is president.""[37]
Lewis draws on his historical involvement in the civil rights movement as part of his politics. He ""makes an annual pilgrimage to Alabama to retrace the route he marched in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery  a route Lewis has since had declared part of the Historic National Trails program. That trip has become one of the hottest tickets in Washington among lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, eager to associate themselves with Lewis and the movement. 'We don't deliberately set out to win votes, but it's very helpful,' Lewis said of the trip"".[11]
In March 2010, a report that Lewis and another black Congressman, Andre Carson, had been called nigger by Tea Party protesters outside the Capitol received media attention.[38][39] Some conservative sources criticized the claim, saying that no video showed up to prove the charges, and the videotapes of the event that later surfaced seemed to in fact disprove them. The New York Times issued a correction in July 2010, acknowledging that there was no evidence of Tea Party members hurling racial epithets at Lewis and Carson. Andrew Breitbart offered a $100,000 reward for anyone who could provide audio or video evidence of one of these instances, but none surfaced.[40]
In March 2003, Lewis spoke to a crowd of 30,000 in Oregon during an anti-war protest before the start of the Iraq War.[41] He was arrested in 2006[42] and 2009 and outside the Sudan embassy in protest against the genocide in Darfur.[43] He was one of eight U.S. Representatives, from six states, arrested while holding a sit-in near the west side of the U.S. Capitol building, to advocate for illegal immigration reform. The lawmakers' participation and subsequent arrest in the protest occurred despite the fact that the 2013 government shutdown was going on at the time.[44]
When Lewis was asked at a news conference whether he would support Joe Lieberman for re-election to the Senate in 2006 after Lieberman's loss to Ned Lamont in the Democratic primary, he simply said that Lieberman ""was a good man."" That was taken to mean that he endorsed Lieberman in the race. Actually he had been invited to Connecticut by another member of Congress and had made no plan to formally endorse Lieberman.[45] In the 2004 Presidential race, Lewis endorsed Senator John Kerry (Democrat).[46] Lewis was one of 31 House members who voted not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[47]
At first, Lewis supported Hillary Rodham Clinton, endorsing her presidential campaign on October 12, 2007.[48] On February 14, 2008, however, he announced he was considering withdrawing his support from Clinton and might instead cast his superdelegate vote for Barack Obama: ""Something is happening in America and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap.""[49] Ben Smith of Politico said that ""it would be a seminal moment in the race if John Lewis were to switch sides.""[50]
On February 27, 2008, Lewis formally changed his support and endorsed Obama.[51][52] After Obama clinched the Democratic nomination for president, Lewis said ""If someone had told me this would be happening now, I would have told them they were crazy, out of their mind, they didnt know what they were talking about ... I just wish the others were around to see this day. ... To the people who were beaten, put in jail, were asked questions they could never answer to register to vote, it's amazing.""[53] Despite switching his support to Obama, Lewis' support of Clinton for several months led to criticism from his constituents. One of his challengers in the House primary election set up campaign headquarters inside the building that served as Obama's Georgia office.[54]
In October 2008, Lewis issued a statement criticizing the campaign of John McCain and Sarah Palin and accusing them of ""sowing the seeds of hatred and division"" in a way that brought to mind the late Gov. George Wallace and ""another destructive period"" in American political history. McCain said he was ""saddened"" by the criticism from ""a man I've always admired"", and called on Obama to repudiate Lewis's statement. Obama responded to the statement, saying that he ""does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies.[55] Lewis later issued a follow-up statement clarifying that he had not compared McCain and Palin to Wallace himself, but rather that his earlier statement was a ""reminder to all Americans that toxic language can lead to destructive behavior.""[56]
In October 2011, a meeting of Occupy Atlanta participants did not reach consensus to allow Lewis to address the crowd. A video clip of protestors discussing the situation, and Lewis leaving without speaking, is published online.[57][58] Lewis said that he was not perturbed by the incident, and noted that ""These are different times.""[58]
In an interview for the Grio, on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Lewis told a reporter, ""We have not yet created a truly multiracial democratic society in America. It's not post-racial."" On an African American being elected president he said:[59]
""If you ask me whether the election ... is the fulfillment of Dr. King's dream, I say, 'No, it's just a down payment.' There's still too many people 50 years later, there's still too many people that are being left out and left behind.""
A special election was called in 1977 after President Jimmy Carter appointed incumbent U.S. Congressman Andrew Young to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In the Democratic special primary, Lewis and fellow Atlanta City Councilman Wyche Fowler qualified for the run-off primary because no candidate reached the 50% threshold and they were the top two candidates.[14] Fowler defeated Lewis 62%38%.[15] In 1986, when Fowler retired to run for the United States Senate, Lewis defeated fellow civil rights leader and State Senator Julian Bond in the run-off primary 52%48%.[17] This upset win[12] was tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic, majority-black 5th District, Lewis won the 1986 general election with 75% of the vote.[18] Lewis was the second African American to represent Georgia in Congress since Reconstruction. (Young was the first.) In 1988, he won re-election with 78% of the vote.[60] In the 1990s, his lowest winning percentage was 69% in 1994. In 2010, he won re-election with 74% of the vote.[61]
Since 1991, Lewis has been senior chief deputy whip in the Democratic caucus.[citation needed] A December 2009 report on privately financed Congressional travel by The New York Times found Lewis to be recipient of the most trips since 2007, with a total of 40.[62]
Lewis's autobiography, Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement was published in 1999. His life is also the subject of a 2002 book for young people, John Lewis: From Freedom Rider to Congressman.
In 2013, Lewis became the first member of Congress to write a graphic novel, March: Book One, the first in a planned autobiographical trilogy co-written with Andrew Aydin and drawn by Nate Powell.[63] In an August 2014 interview, Lewis cited the influence of a 1958 comic book, Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Boycott, on his decision to adapt his experience to the graphic novel format.[64]
Lewis met Lillian Miles at a New Year's Eve party hosted by Xernona Clayton. They married in 1968. Together, they had one son, named John-Miles. Lillian died on December 31, 2012.[65]
Lewis is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.[66]
Lewis is honored with the 1997 sculpture by Thornton Dial, The Bridge, at Ponce de Leon Avenue and Freedom Park, Atlanta. Two years later, in 1999, Lewis was awarded the Wallenberg Medal from the University of Michigan in recognition of his courageous lifelong commitment to the defense of civil and human rights.
In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded Lewis the Profile in Courage Award ""for his extraordinary courage, leadership and commitment to civil rights.""[67] It is a lifetime achievement award and has only been given out twice, John Lewis and William Winter (in 2008).The next year he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[68]
In 2006, he received the US Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[69] In September 2007, Lewis was awarded the Dole Leadership Prize from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.[70]
Lewis was the only living speaker from the March on Washington who was present on the stage during the inauguration of Barack Obama. Obama signed a commemorative photograph for Lewis with the words, ""Because of you, John. Barack Obama.""[71]
On November 17, 2010, Lewis was awarded the First LBJ Liberty and Justice for All Award, given to him by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation,[72] and the next year, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[73]

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in the northern suburbs of Atlanta. He previously served as chairman of the Republican Study Committee and the Republican Policy Committee.[1][2] Price currently serves as chairman of the House Budget Committee.[3]


Price was born in Lansing, Michigan. He grew up in Dearborn, where he attended Adams Jr. High and Dearborn High School.
He graduated with an M.D. from the University of Michigan. He completed his residency at Emory University in Atlanta, and decided to settle in the suburb of Roswell, where he still lives. He is a past President of the Roswell Rotary Club and has served on the Boards of the North Fulton Chamber of Commerce.[4]
He ran an orthopedic clinic in Atlanta for 20 years before returning to Emory as assistant professor of orthopedic surgery. Price also was the director of the orthopedic clinic at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital.
In 1996, State Senator Sallie Newbill (R) decided not to run for re-election. Price was the Republican nominee for Georgia's 56th senate district. In the November general election, he defeated Democrat Ellen Milholland 71%-29%.[5] In 1998, he won re-election to a second term by defeating her in a rematch, 75%-25%.[6] In 2000 and 2002, he won re-election to a third and fourth term unopposed.[7][8]
In 2004, U.S. Congressman Johnny Isakson of Georgia's 6th congressional district decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No Democrat even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from Fulton County, while Lamutt and Clay were both from Cobb County. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: Fulton with 63% and Cherokee with 35%. Lamutt carried Cobb with 31% of the vote.[11] In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.[12] Price won the general election unopposed.[13]
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.[14] In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.[15]
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),[16] 2010 (100%),[17] and 2012 (65%).[18]
In 2011, he voted to prohibit funding of NPR,[19] to terminate the Emergency Mortgage Relief Program,[20] to extend the PATRIOT act,[21][22] to repeal portions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 on multiple occasions,[23][24] to reduce non-security discretionary spending to 2008 levels[25][26][27](and subsequently voted against several amendments offered via motions to recommit with instructions)[28]),to reduce Federal spending and the deficit by terminating taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns and party conventions,[29] to provide funding for government agencies, including the department of defense, through September 30, 2011,[30] to cut the Federal Housing Authority's refinancing program,[31] and against a resolution which would force the president to withdraw American forces from Iraq.[32] In 2013, he was the main sponsor of the Require A PLAN Act;[33] he voted for the No Budget, No Pay Act[33] and a resolution establishing a budget for the United States Government for FY 2014 that passed the House of Representatives.[33]
Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.[34][35] He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center. He was rated at 0 by Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.[36][37] He participated in the 2011 March for Life.[38]
Tom Price opposes gun control. He praised the Supreme Court's decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller, which found that the absolute prohibition of handguns in the District of Columbia was unconstitutional, and McDonald v. Chicago, which stated that the Second Amendment applied to the states.[39] He was given an ""A"" grade by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, a 92% approval rating overall from the National Rifle Association and an 83% approval rating[40] from the Gun Owners of America, and a 0% approval rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.[37][41]
Tom Price voted against a bill prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation (Nov 2007). He voted in favor of constitutionally defining marriage as one-man-one-woman (Jul 2006). Representative Price voted against H.R. 2965, which would have ended Don't ask, don't tell. He receives a 0% rating by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization.[42]
Tom Price does not support federal regulation of farming. He has voted against regulating and restricting farmers, earning him a 70% from the American Farm Bureau Federation. However, due to this belief, the National Farmers Union gave him a 0% approval rate.[43] He supported the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, stating that it would keep the Environmental Protection Agency from applying too many regulations to farming and ranching.[44] He also voted for the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2012 which, had it become law, would have made supplemental agricultural disaster assistance available, if needed.[45][46]
In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[47]
Price is the sponsor of the Empowering Patients First Act (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.
Price introduced the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress) on May 8, 2013.[48] The bill would require the Congressional Budget Office to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.[49] Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost. Price said ""that is a model that has proven to be incapable of providing the type of macroeconomic diagnosis folks need to make sure we are pursuing policies that will help generate economic opportunity and bring down the nation's debt.""[50] H.R. 1874 has passed the House but has yet to become law.
In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:[51]
Price and his wife Betty reside in Roswell, and have one child, Robert Price.[52] Betty is currently a city councilwoman for the City of Roswell.[53] Price is a Presbyterian."

He is a member of the Republican Party. Prior to being elected to congress, he was the Chief of Staff to U.S. Congressman John Linder (R-GA). He worked for Linder from 1994 to 2010.


Woodall was born in Athens, GA. He attended both public and private grade schools, and graduated from Marist School in 1988. He attended Furman University followed by law school at the University of Georgia. While attending law school, he spent summers working in a Washington, D.C. law firm. He left law school after the summer of 1994 to work for his hometown U.S. Representative John Linder. Woodall later finished law school in 1998.[4]
He won the Republican primary with about 56% of the vote against Jody Hice.[5] He faced Democrat Doug Heckman in the 2010 General Election.[6] On November 2, 2010, Woodall defeated Heckman to win the election.[7]
The top donors to Woodall's campaign funds were the Credit Union National Association, the Southern Company, the American Dental Association, and the Vision for Tomorrow Fund.[8]
Woodall addressed the U.S. House on October 26, 2011, in which he called for reducing regulation on businesses.[9]
Woodall voted for repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in January, 2011.
In July 2011, he voted for the Cut, Cap and Balance Act during the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis.
In October 2011, Woodall voted for legislation to restrict how private insurance companies listed on a public insurance exchange may offer abortion coverage.[10]
Woodall was one of only six Republicans who opposed legislation that would require all states to honor the concealed weapons permits of other states, arguing that the bill was unnecessary because the Second Amendment already gives Americans the right to bear arms.[11]
Woodall is also one of only six House Republicans in the 112th Congress who have not signed Grover Norquist's ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" stating that ""my commitment to the Fair Tax and a common-sense tax overhaul makes it impossible for me to support the second component of the Pledge, which states that I must 'oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.'""[12][13]
On July 24, 2013 Woodall voted against Representative Justin Amash's (R-Michigan) amendment to HR 2397 which would have ended the National Security Agency's ability to collect and store data on the phone calls of every American without a warrant.[14]
Woodall introduced the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress) into the House on May 8, 2013.[15] The bill would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in CBOs baseline.[16] Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current years appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward.[16]
Woodall took office as part of the 112th United States Congress in January 2011. In July 2014, Woodall was elected chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative Republican lawmakers, succeeding Steve Scalise.[17]

Scott's father, Dr. Jim Scott, is an orthopedic surgeon and his mother, Becky, is a teacher in the public school system. Scott graduated from the University of Georgia with a B.B.A. in Risk Management and Insurance. He also passed the Series 7 Exam.[1]
Scott is president of The Southern Group, LLC and a partner in Lockett Station Group, LLC.[2]
Representative Scott was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives at the age of 26. He was the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. He also served on the Appropriations, Rules, and Ways and Means Committee, where he was the chairman of the Public Policy Subcommittee. The District consists of Tift and Turner counties.
Scott challenged Democratic incumbent Jim Marshall for Georgia's eighth congressional district. He defeated Marshall in the general election on November 2, 2010, 52.6% to Marshall's 47.4%.[3]
Scott originally planned to campaign for Governor of Georgia, announcing his campaign in January 2009. He made headlines for walking more than 1,000 miles around the state in his ""Walk of Georgia"", introducing a bill to abolish tolls on Georgia 400, and leading the charge in pressuring Georgia State Attorney General Thurbert Baker to file a lawsuit against the Federal government over the controversial health care reform bill passed in March 2010.[4][5][6][7] In April 2010, Scott withdrew from the race for Governor to instead run for U.S. Congress.
In 2010 Scott signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[8]
The Georgia General Assembly redrew the 8th after the 2010 census. Notably, most of Macon and surrounding Bibb County (except for a sliver in the north) were drawn into the neighboring 2nd District. Macon had been the heart of the 8th and its predecessors for more than a century. To make up for the loss of population, the General Assembly pushed the 8th all the way to the Florida border, adding Thomasville and most of Valdosta from the old 2nd. The old 8th already had a significant Republican lean, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+10. However, the new 8th has a CPVI of R+15, making it the 11th most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone and one of the most Republican districts in the country.
Scott was unopposed in both the primary and general elections.[9]
Scott resides in Tifton with his wife, Vivien, and thirteen-year old son, Wells. The Scotts are members of First Baptist Church of Tifton.[10][11]

He was elected in 2014.


Hice is a native of Atlanta and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a Doctor of Ministry degree from Luther Rice Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia.[2]
Hice first served as senior pastor of Bethlehem First Baptist Church, until April 2010[3] in Bethlehem, Georgia. In addition, he served as first vice president of the Georgia Baptist Convention (200405) and Professor of Preaching at Luther Rice Seminary. Hice served as senior pastor at The Summit Church, a Southern Baptist church, in Loganville, Georgia from 2011 until December 2013, when he stepped down to run for office.
In September 2008, the Reverend Hice was one of 33 pastors across America who participated in ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday"",[4] an effort that challenged an Internal Revenue Service code threatening churches and pastors with loss of tax-exempt status and criminal behavior if they address political issues from the pulpit. In that sermon, Hice endorsed Senator John McCain for President. The IRS never publicly responded to the event, and Pulpit Freedom Sunday has since grown to include over 450 churches.[5]
In January 2009, Hice and Aaron Evans (a Christian speaker and media personality from Virginia)[6] launched Hope For America Rallies to educate Americans on the alleged Christian influences in America's founding.[7]
During the battle between the ACLU and Barrow County, Georgia, regarding the public display of the Ten Commandments in the County Courthouse, Reverend Hice was asked by a local radio station to provide weekly updates and to address various other issues.[8] Out of that weekly program was started a daily show, Let Freedom Ring, which was originally heard on WIMO 1300 AM, Bethlehem, Georgia, Monday through Friday. The show is heard on about 400 stations,[9] the show focuses on Constitutional, moral, and religious liberty issues. The show features commentary and interviews with various guests on these topics. The show is now called The Jody Hice Show.
The Congressional Seat for Georgia's 10th Congressional District opened up when the sitting representative, Paul Broun, announced his bid for U.S. Senate in 2014.[10] Jody Hice was the second to formally enter the race on April 15, 2013, citing government spending as his foremost concern.[11] Hice was soon joined by 5 other candidates, leading to primary election of 7 for the open seat. Hice placed first in the primary on May 20, 2014 with 33.5% of the vote, followed closely by his run-off opponent Mike Collins who won 33% of the vote.[12]
With no candidate winning 50% of the vote, a run-off campaign was issued between the top two candidates, Jody Hice and Mike Collins. The close race quickly grew heated amid accusations of campaign sign theft from both sides and reports of supporters being harassed at debates.[13] Hice ultimately won the run-off, grabbing 54% of the vote.[14]
Hice faced a Democratic opponent in November election, which he won in a GOP wave on Nov. 4, 2014.[15]
Jody Hice's high-margin victory in his 2014 run-off with Mike Collins has been largely attributed to his comprehensive grassroots campaign. During his primary, Mr. Hice gained a reputation for hiring interns and staff members to do campaign work. A team of as few as ten interns made tens-of-thousands of calls to counteract a Democratic push in the state to elect a more moderate Republican.[16]
National media outlets have drawn attention to Jody Hice's views on Islam regarding his book, ""A Call to Reclaim America"", in which he claims that Islam is not only a religion, but a geo-political structure and is therefore not deserving of First Amendment protection.[17] Hice, in his book It's Now or Never, also quoted former U.S. general Jerry Boykin as stating that there is a Muslim Brotherhood plot to take over the United States.[18] Boykin has been classified as an anti-Muslim extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[19]
Hice has also drawn criticisms from his comments on opposing gay marriage.[20] He particularly drew criticism from an episode of his radio show in which he voiced his concerns about banning conversion therapy. In this show he claimed homosexuality is a choice and is indulging a sinful tendency, much like alcoholism or drug abuse.[21]
Hice's views on gender equality have also invited scrutiny. In a 2004 interview with the Athens Banner-Herald, the largest newspaper in Hice's district, Hice stated that a woman had to be ""within the authority of her husband"" if she wanted to run for public office.[22]"

In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[2] and voted for H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[3] In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined ""unlawful Internet gambling"").
David Scott voted for healthcare reform. In the discussion leading up to his vote, Congressman Scott fielded several different points of view. On August 6, 2009, Scott was confronted by a local doctor who claimed to live in Scott's district. The doctor, who later appeared in subsequent debates with his opposition candidate, asked Scott why he was going to vote for a health care plan similar to the plan implemented in Massachusetts and if he supported a government-provided health care insurance option. Scott questioned whether or not the doctor was a resident of Scott's district, although the local TV station WXIA-TV's news department confirmed that the doctor did live and work in Scott's district.[4]
Many others in attendance, however, were later discovered not to be residents of the 13th Congressional District and were 'planted' there by a vocal opposition minority. Scott also noted that Dr. Hill had not called Scott's office for setting up a meeting concerning health care but this has not been verified.[5] Scott has allegedly received death threats from neoconservative activists.[6] A swastika was found spray painted on a sign outside of his congressional office in his congressional district, reportedly painted by neoconservative activists. An investigation is underway.[7]
Although Scott voted against the first version of the 2008 bailout, he backed the final version ""after being assured the legislation would aid homeowners facing foreclosures. Scott crafted an added provision dedicating $14 billion to aid those homeowners.""[8]
Scott supported two failed pieces of legislation in 2004 and 2006 that aimed to establish a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.[8][9] However, in May 2013 thinkprogress.org reported receiving an email from a spokesman of Scott saying, 'Congressman Scott fully supports marriage equality.'[10] HRC's profile of Scott also contains this sentence as his statement under 'position on marriage equality'.[11]
David Scott is brother-in-law to baseball hall of fame member Hank Aaron.
In 1978 David Scott founded owned Dayn-Mark Advertising (from the names of his two daughters, Dayna and Marcie), which places billboards and other forms of advertising in the Atlanta area. Scott's wife, Alfredia, now heads the business. In May 2007, it was reported that the business owes more than $150,000 in back taxes and penalties.[12] Scott's campaigns have paid the company more than $500,000 over the eight years totalling from 2002 until current date - for office rent, printing, T-shirts, and other services. He has also paid his wife, two daughters, and son-in-law tens of thousands of dollars for campaign work such as fund raising and canvassing. In 2007, Scott was named one of the 25 most corrupt members of Congress by the political watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.[13]"
"127","","2010*","1970","Georgia 14","University of Georgia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Graves","Tom Graves","Republican","Georgia House of Representatives,","Baptist - SBC","John Thomas ""Tom"" Graves, Jr. (born February 3, 1970) is the U.S. Representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district, serving since winning a special election for Georgia's 9th congressional district in 2010. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is located in the northwestern part of the state, and runs along the border with Tennessee and Alabama. GA-14 encompasses most of rural and suburban Northwest Georgia, from Dade County to Murray County along the Georgia-Tennessee line, and from Dade County to Haralson County along the Georgia-Alabama line. It extends southward and eastward to the fringes of the Atlanta metropolitan area, including Paulding County. Graves served in the Georgia House of Representatives before being elected to the House of Representatives. His original district, the 9th, was a heavily Republican district; according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, it was the third-most Republican district in the nation and the most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone. Graves' current district is ranked by Cook as the eighth-most Republican district in the nation and the second-most Republican district in Georgia.


Tom Graves was born in St. Petersburg, Florida on February 3, 1970.[1] He graduated from Cass High School of Cartersville, GA, where he played linebacker and offensive guard on the school football team.[2] Graves earned his Bachelors of Business Administration from the University of Georgia. After college, he bought a landscaping company before working in real estate investment.[2] Graves lives in Ranger, Georgia, southeast of Dalton.[1]
After redistricting, incumbent Democrat Tom E. Shanahan of Georgia's 10th House District decided to retire. Graves won the open seat with 60% of the vote.[3] After mid-decade redistricting, Graves decided to run for Georgia's 12th House District, vacated by Republican Jeff Lewis who decided to run in the 15th District. Graves won unopposed in 2004.[4] He won re-election unopposed in 2006[5] and 2008.[6]
As State Representative Graves served on the Transportation, Ways and Means and Health and Human Services committee, and as Vice Chairman of the Motor Vehicles committee.
American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) honored Graves as the 2009 Entrepreneurial Legislator of the Year.[7] In 2009, he was endorsed by the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots.[8]
Graves finished first in the special election held on May 11, 2010 after Nathan Deal resigned from Congress to run for governor, and proceeded to a run-off which was held on June 8, 2010. He won the runoff against former State Senator Lee Hawkins.[9]
Graves faced Hawkins again in the July 20, 2010 Republican primary for the November general election. He came in first but fell short of the requisite 50% plus one majority in order to avoid a runoff and would once again face Hawkins in the primary runoff. This was the fourth time Graves faced Hawkins as an opponent in both the special and general primaries along with their respective runoffs. The 9th district is so heavily Republican that whoever won the runoff was all but assured of winning a full term. Graves won the primary runoff on August 10, 2010. He won the November 2, 2010 general election unopposed.
After redistricting, Graves' home in Ranger was drawn into the newly created 14th district, which is basically the northwestern portion of the old 9th. Graves opted to run in the 14th[10] This district, like his old one, is heavily Republican, and Graves easily defeated a nominal Democratic challenger with 73 percent of the vote.
Representative Graves is a pro-life politician and voted in 2011 to limit funding to Planned Parenthood.[11] He has stated that he opposes abortion ""without exception"", including when the mother's life is at stake.[12]
Graves was endorsed by the Atlanta Tea Party in 2010.[13] He authored the Defund Obamacare Act in 2010 and reintroduced the bill in the 112th and 113th Congress.[14]
Graves co-sponsored a balanced-budget amendment in both the 112th and 113th Congresses and supported the Cut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011, which aimed to reduce federal spending and establish caps in future spending.[15] The same year, Graves introduced the HOME Act to allow Americans to make withdrawals from their retirement accounts to pay timely mortgage payments in 2011.[16] He also voted against removing US troops from Afghanistan in March 2011.[17] Graves introduced the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA) in 2011, meant to lower the federal gas tax to 3.7 cents per gallon and transfer nearly all funding authority to U.S. states over a period of five years.[18] Graves voted in favor of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act in 2013, which funded the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project[19] in its expansion of the Savannah Harbor shipping channel from a depth of -42 feet to -47 feet.[20] He also authored the Email Privacy Act with Representatives Kevin Yoder and Jared Polis.[21] Graves led the national movement to defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") in 2013.[14]
Graves and his wife Julie have three children and are active members of Belmont Baptist Church in Calhoun, Georgia.[22]
In 2011, Graves and a business partner (state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers) were accused of defaulting on a $2.2 million bank loan for a real estate investment. Attorneys for Graves argued that the bank had been at fault for loaning him money that they knew he couldn't repay, making the signed personal guarantees invalid. Graves and his partner were no longer involved with the company used to take out the loan after transferring ownership to another party in 2009.[23] The new owner (the hotel's former manager) agreed to purchase the company and its real estate and debt from Graves and Rogers for $10,000 but says they never actually required him to pay them anything.[24] The default on Graves' loan contributed significantly to the collapse of the Bartow County Bank (the small community bank which loaned the $2.2 million to Graves). The bank's collapse and liquidation cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $69.5 million. According to Morgan Akin (the former bank chairman), he only approved the loan to Graves and Rodgers because, ""They were well-respected members of the community, and we took that into account,"" and he never imagined such prominent political figures would default.[25] Furthermore, although Graves and Rogers claimed the new owner of the company only defaulted on the loan because the bank reneged on a promise to refinance, the bank countered that the loan was in default before the sale of their company and they invalidated their refinancing deal because they sold the company without informing the bank. In August 2011, the bank's dispute with Graves was settled out of court and no details of the settlement were disclosed.[26][27] Due to unpaid property taxes going back to 2009, the city may have to seize the property and spend over $100,000 to secure and eventually demolish it.[28]"

She is also a Vice-Chair of the Democratic National Committee.[4] Elected in 2012, she is the first American Samoan [5] and the first Hindu member of the United States Congress,[6] and, along with Tammy Duckworth, one of its first female combat veterans.[7]
Gabbard previously served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004, becoming the youngest woman in the United States to be elected to a state legislature.[8] She declined to seek a second term after volunteering for a 12-month combat tour in Iraq. She returned to the United States in 2006 and worked for U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka, then volunteering for another deployment to the Middle East in 2009. After returning to Hawaii, she was elected to the Honolulu City Council, where she served from 2011 to 2012. In 2012, she ran for the open second congressional district and won the primary with 55%, scoring an upset win over former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann. She won the general election with 81% of the vote and in the House of Representatives, she serves on the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees. She is also currently a Military Police company commander with the Hawaii Army National Guard.


Tulsi Gabbard was born in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children of Mike Gabbard and Carol Porter Gabbard. Her family moved to Hawaii in 1983 when Gabbard was two. Gabbard grew up in a multicultural, multi-religious household. Her father is of Samoan/European heritage and is a practicing Catholic who is a lector at his church, but also enjoys practicing mantra meditation, including kirtan.[9] Her mother is of Euro-American descent and a practicing Hindu.[9] Tulsi fully embraced Hinduism as a teenager.[9] Her siblings' names are: Bhakti, Jai, Aryan and Vrindavan.[10]
Gabbard was homeschooled through high school, except for two years she attended a girls-only missionary academy in the Philippines.[11] Gabbard graduated from Hawaii Pacific University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree in international business in 2009.[12][13][14]
In 2002, after a redistricting, Gabbard (as Gabbard Tamayo) ran for Hawaii's 42nd House District of the Hawaii House of Representatives. In a four-candidate Democratic primary, she won with a plurality of 48%. She defeated Rida Cabanilla (30%), Dolfo Ramos (18%), and Gerald Vidal (4%).[15] Gabbard Tamayo won the general election, defeating Republican Alfonso Jimenez 65%35%.[16]
In 2004, Gabbard Tamayo filed for re-election, but then volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq. Cabanilla, who filed for a rematch, called on the incumbent to resign, because she would not be able to represent her district from Iraq.[17] Gabbard Tamayo thus decided not to campaign for a second term.[18] Cabanilla defeated Gabbard Tamayo in the Democratic primary 64%25%.[19]
In 2002, at the age of 21, Gabbard Tamayo became the youngest legislator ever elected in the history of Hawaii and the youngest woman elected to state office in the nation.[8][20] She represented the Oahu 42nd District, which covers Waipahu, Honouliuli, and Ewa Beach.
She played a key role, along with her Ewa colleagues, in securing funding for infrastructure on the Ewa Plains.[14]

She supported legislation to expand tax credits for solar and wind, improve the net energy metering program, establish renewable energy portfolio standards, reduce taxes on the sale of ethanol and biofuels, provide funding for a seawater air conditioning project and make it easier for condo/townhouse owners to get solar.[21]
Regarding the environment, Gabbard supported legislation to better protect air quality, the water supply, endangered species & avian/marine life, fight invasive species, reduce greenhouse gases, promote recycling of food waste & packaging, improve the Deposit Beverage Container Program (bottle law), and reduce illegal dumping.[21]
She opposed LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage and civil unions. When voting against legalizing civil unions, she stated: ""To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue...As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists."" In August 2004, she defended her then-Republican father's anti-LGBT work, and called supporters of U.S. Congressman Ed Case ""homosexual extremists.""[22][23]
In April 2003, while serving in office, Gabbard Tamayo enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard.[24] She received several distinguished honor graduate titles and awards at Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training.[citation needed]
In July 2004, Gabbard Tamayo asked to deploy with her Hawaii Army National Guard unit, volunteering for a 12-month tour in Iraq, where she served in a field medical unit as a specialist with a 29th Support Battalion medical company.[25] She learned that she would not be able to serve with her unit and perform her duties as a legislator, and thus chose not to campaign for a second term in office.[18][26] Gabbard served at Logistical Support Area Anaconda in Iraq.[27] While on a rest-and-relaxation tour in August 2005, she presented Hawaii's condolences to the government of London regarding the 7/7 terrorist attacks.[25] She was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal at the end of this tour.[citation needed]

She continued to work for Senator Akaka until 2009, when she again voluntarily deployed with her unit to the Middle East. During this second deployment, in addition to leading her platoon on a wide variety of security missions, she also conducted non-military host-nation visits and served as a primary trainer for the Kuwait National Guard.[citation needed] She was one of the first women to set foot inside a Kuwait military facility,[citation needed] and became the first woman to ever to be awarded and honored by the Kuwait National Guard[31] for her work in their training and readiness program.[citation needed]

After returning home from her second deployment to the Middle East in 2009, Gabbard Tamayo ran for a seat on the Honolulu City Council.[38] Incumbent City Councilman Rod Tam, of the 6th district, decided to retire in order to run for Mayor of Honolulu. In a ten candidate nonpartisan open primary field in September 2010, Gabbard Tamayo ranked first with 33% of the vote.[39] In the November 2 runoff election, she defeated Sesnita Moepono 58%42% to win the seat.[40]
In her capacity as committee chair, Gabbard Tamayo took the lead on many issues such as medical waste, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), dengue fever, and creating new economic opportunities through Honolulus first Sister City Summit.[citation needed] As a Council member, Gabbard Tamayo introduced a measure to help food truck vendors by loosening parking restrictions.[41]
She also introduced Bill 54,[42] a measure that authorized City workers to confiscate personal belongings stored on public property.[43] The measure overcame opposition from the ACLU[44] and Occupy Hawai'i,[45] and a potential conflict with Hawaii's constitutional law, Knwai Mmalahoe, which protects ""those who sleep by the roadside"".[46] Bill 54 passed[45] and became City Ordinance 1129.
On April 30, 2011, the council member informed her constituents that she was resuming the use of her birth name, ""Tulsi Gabbard,"" and that there would be no cost to city taxpayers for reprinting City Council materials containing her name.[47]
Gabbard resigned her council seat on August 16, 2012, to focus on her congressional seat bid.[48]
In early 2011, Mazie Hirono, the incumbent Congresswoman in Hawaii's second congressional district, announced that she would run for a U.S. Senate seat. Soon after that, in May 2011, Gabbard announced her candidacy for the Congressional seat.[49] Gabbard was endorsed by the Sierra Club,[50] Emily's List,[51] and VoteVets.org.[52] The biggest name by far in the crowded six-way primary was Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann. However, Gabbard won the August 11 primary in a major upset, taking 55 percent of the vote. Hannemann finished second with only 34 percent. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser described her win as the ""improbable rise from a distant underdog to victory"".[53] She then announced on August 13 that she would resign her seat on the City Council, stating that she wanted to prevent the cost of a separate special election,[54] and resigned on August 16.[55]
As the Democratic nominee, Gabbard traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[56] There, she credited grassroots support as the reason for her come-from-behind win in the primary.[57]
Gabbard won the general election on November 6, 2012 by defeating Republican Kawika Crowley 81% to 19%.[58] However, the 2nd is so heavily Democratic that she had effectively clinched the seat with her primary victory.
In December 2012, Gabbard applied to be considered for appointment to the Senate seat vacated by the death of Daniel Inouye,[59] but despite support from prominent mainland Democrats,[60][61] she was not among the three candidates selected by the Hawaii Democratic party.[62]
Gabbard co-founded Healthy Hawaii Coalition, an environmental educational group of which she is Vice President and Educational Programs Coordinator.[50][63] She is a lifetime member of the National Guard Association of the United States and the Military Police Regimental Association.[citation needed]
Gabbard was also a cofounder of the non-profit Stand Up For America,[64] which she and her father co-founded in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[65] SUFA's site profiled Gabbard[66] and hosted letters from Gabbard sent during her deployments overseas.[67][68] The Stand Up For America site came under criticism in September 2010 for promoting Gabbard's campaign for the Honolulu City Council. Gabbard said the improper addition ""was an honest mistake from a volunteer"", and the problematic page and link were immediately removed.[64]
Gabbard is pro-choice.[69] On the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, she stated her support for that decision and for affordable healthcare services ""which can contribute to fewer unplanned and teen pregnancies"".[70] She supports the Affordable Care Act's mandate that all health insurance provide contraception with no co-pay.[71] In a 2011 interview with the Honolulu Civil Beat, Gabbard said she disagreed with the Obama administration's decision to overrule the FDA in allowing girls under 17 to purchase Plan B without a prescription.[72]
Gabbard is opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act and to a proposed state constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a woman and a man.[73] She had previously opposed same-sex marriage[22] but now promises to work to repeal DOMA and co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage Act,[74] and asks state legislators ""to pass legislation that will ensure fair and equal treatment for all of Hawaii's citizens.""[75]
She publicly supports reproductive choice and LGBT populations, saying that the government should not be the moral arbiter in peoples lives.[22] She credits her tours of duty in the Middle East with triggering her change in views.[76]
Her father, Mike Gabbard, is a staunch anti-gay marriage Democrat (previously Republican) who is currently the State Senator for Hawaii's 19th District. The familial connection, and her previous stance,[22] initially caused voters to doubt the sincerity of her new support for LGBT causes.[76]
Gabbard believes women should be allowed to serve in all military roles, including combat,[71] and praised the US Department of Defense for lifting its ban on women serving in ground combat roles.[77]
Although she served in the war in Iraq, she said in late 2012, ""I was against the war in Iraq. We never should have gone there in the first place.""[78] She calls for an immediate withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan[79] ""as quickly and safely as possible"".[80] Rep. Gabbard believes that one problem with the US's involvement in Iraq is that victory conditions have not been clearly defined.[81]
Gabbard received the endorsement of Equality Hawaii regarding her support for ""equal rights for same-sex military spouses (following the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell)"".[82]
Responding to the Obama Administration's policy on using drones in the United States, Gabbard stated that ""these tactics should never be used against our own citizens here at home.""[83] She said that she had
However, her phrasing as a Representative, arguing that ""drone strikes and other counter-terrorism tactics should not be targeting non-combatant U.S. citizens,""[83] has narrower language than her earlier statements[78] in favor of protecting the rights of all American citizens to due process.[85]
On April 22, 2012, Gabbard received a Sierra Club endorsement in the Democratic primary election for Hawaii's District 2.[86] Gabbard favors tax incentives for renewable energy startups.[87]
In her campaign materials and editorials, Gabbard calls for a restoration of the Glass Steagall Act,[88] a ban on naked credit defaults, and forced breakup of the ""big banks.""[89] She also condemned banks that foreclosed on the homes of deployed troops.[90]
To encourage tourism,[87] Gabbard aims to relax ""outdated""[91] visa restrictions for tourists, especially those originating in India and China.[9] She will also focus on H-1B visas and legal immigration issues.[9]
Gabbard supports the Akaka Bill, ""believe[s] the U.S. government through an act of Congress should more formally recognize the special legal/political status of Native Hawaiians,""[92] and supports Native Hawaiian health and education initiatives.[93]
In opposing sequestration cuts, Gabbard has said that the cuts are being used as a ""political tool""[94] and that the ""arbitrary, across-the-board cuts"" would affect military readiness.[95]
Gabbard is in favor of allowing Medicare to negotiate with prescription drug firms, stating that, on average, that would save US taxpayers ""around $14 billion a year.""[84]
Gabbard's first name, ""Tulsi,"" comes from the name of the holy basil, a plant sacred in Hinduism.[96] She is a vegetarian and a Hindu who follows Gaudiya Vaishnavism,[11] a religious movement brought to the United States in the 1960s by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada under the name ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. She especially appreciates the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide,[3] and used the Gita when she was ceremonially sworn in as a Representative.[97] Gabbard describes herself as a ""karma yogi""[98] and credits her parents with instilling the value of ""karma yoga"" and being of service in her and her siblings.[30] As a Vaishnava, Gabbard looks forward to visiting India, especially the holy sites of Vrindavan, after starting her Congressional term.[99]
Gabbard has said that she is pleased that her election gives hope to young American Hindus who ""can be open about their faith, and even run for office, without fear of being discriminated against or attacked because of their religion"".[100] In 2002, Gabbard was a martial arts instructor.[101]
Gabbard was married to Eduardo Tamayo;[47] they divorced on June 5, 2006.[2] She cites ""the stresses war places on military spouses and families"" as a reason for their divorce.[22] Tamayo donated $500 to Gabbard's House campaign.[102]
Gabbard called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was on a visit to New York on September 28, 2014 and presented him with a ginger flower garland from Hawaii.[103] She also gifted her own copy of the Hindu Holy Book ""Bhagavad Gita"" (same copy that she used to take the Oath of Office) to Narendra Modi.[104]
Tulsi Gabbard accepted the marriage proposal of Abraham Williams in February 2015 and they decided to have a Vedic-style wedding [105]
On March 26, 2014, Elle honored Rep. Gabbard, with others, at the Italian Embassy in the United States during its annual Women in Washington Power List.[106]"

"131","","1999","1950","Idaho 2","Utah State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Simpson","Mike Simpson","Republican","Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives, Blackfoot, Idaho City Council","Mormon","Michael Keith ""Mike"" Simpson, D.M.D. (born September 8, 1950), is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Idaho's 2nd congressional district. First elected in 1998, he is a member of the Republican Party and previously served in the state legislature in Idaho.


Born in Burley, Simpson was raised in Blackfoot, where his father was a dentist. He graduated from Blackfoot High School in 1968, Utah State University in Logan in 1972, and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine[1] in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977.[2] Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot until his election to Congress in 1998. He was elected to the Blackfoot City Council in 1980 and was elected to the state legislature in 1984, the first of seven terms. Simpson was the Speaker of the Idaho House prior to his election to Congress.
While some members of Congress with a medical background prefer to be addressed as ""Doctor"" (most notably former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist),[3] Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson.
In the 111th United States Congress Simpson became the Ranking Member on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Upon assuming this position, and the subsequent chairmanship of the subcommittee, Mr. Simpson is considered a ""Cardinal"" (a term applied to the chairmen or ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittees) within the House Republican Caucus. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee.[4] Known as the ""committee of committees"", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees.[5] Simpson replaced Congressman Don Young (R-AK) on the committee.[4]
On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress).[6] The bill would require the United States Secretary of Agriculture to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on United States Forest Service land in Idaho.[7] Simpson said that ""this legislation clarifies Congress' intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River.""[8]
On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress), a bill that would make appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015.[9] The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is only $50 million less than these agencies currently receive.[10] The appropriations for the United States Department of Energy and the United States Army Corps of Engineers are made by this bill.
Simpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.[11] Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past, he has opposed ""earmarks"", or congressionally directed spending.
Simpson supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.[12]
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.[13]
When asked about the Grover Norquist pledge to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, ""Well, first the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever.""[14]
Simpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the D.C. v. Heller amicus brief which supported a recognition of the Second Amendment as an individual right.[15] As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the ""National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011"".[16] Under this new law, which passed through the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents.[17]
Simpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area. Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks ""wilderness values""[18] because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.[19] Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.[18]
He also played a crucial role with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.[20] Mike Simpson's goal is to amend title 28, and create the appointment of additional Federal Circuit Judges, to divide the Ninth Judicial Circuit into two smaller judicial circuits.[21] The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.
Following the death of Congressman Charlie Norwood (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the American Dental Association (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding methamphetamine, specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or ""methmouth"". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the oral health problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the Department of Health and Human Services, make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to oral health and the provision of dental care.[22] As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to the Subcommittee on Health where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.[23]
Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders.[24] Simpson said that ""the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborns foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives.""[25]
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of nuclear power, extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which oversees the Idaho National Laboratory, a main site for nuclear and alternative energy research in the United States.
Simpson is a strong supporter of the domestic sugar beet producers,[26] and the Idaho potato growers.[27] In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, Walt Minnick, the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.[28] Simpson was quoted as saying, ""The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idahos district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states.""[28]
Simpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda. Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.[29] He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker John Boehner.[30]
Esquire magazine listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.[31] The magazine said of Simpson, ""More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground...""[31] The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by Henry Clay: ""Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively."" This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.[32]
Simpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of John Boehner (R-OH) to the position of House Majority Leader in the 109th United States Congress.[33]
While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order. This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) as a joke. When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.
He has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.[13]
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by Mike Crapo, who was running for United States Senate. He defeated former Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative Jim D. Hansen, son of former Republican Congressman Orval H. Hansen, to win reelection.
Simpson was reelected to a sixth term in 2008, defeating Democrat Debbie Holmes.[34] The final result was 204,465 for Simpson and 83,340 for Holmes, giving Simpson 71% of the vote.[35] Esquire magazine endorsed Simpson for Idaho's Second Congressional District in the 2008 elections, but endorsed Democrat Walt Minnick for Idaho's First Congressional District.[36]
During the 2008 Presidential primaries, Simpson was an early supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and a member of his Congressional Whip Team.[37][38]
Simpson was challenged by Democratic nominee Mike Crawford and Independent candidate Brian Schad.[39][40]
In the Republican primary, Simpson defeated Chick Heileson of Iona and Russ Mathews of Idaho Falls.[41] Each touted himself as a more conservative alternative. Simpson won re-election.
Simpson was challenged by Democratic nominee Nicole LeFavour.
In the Republican primary, Simpson defeated Chick Heileson.
In the 2014 Idaho Republican primary Simpson defeated Bryan Smith, earning 61.8% of the vote.
Source:[42]
During the 2007 scandal involving Senator Larry Craig (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned. Simpson, however, asked Governor C.L. ""Butch"" Otter to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House Appropriations Committee.
Simpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, ""If thats how they treat their own, that tells me theyre more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party.""[43] Simpson is not known to have condoned Craig's alleged misconduct, but he demanded that Craig be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, ""They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they havent said a thing about.""[43]

McCormick Theological Seminary","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Rush","Bobby Rush","Democratic","Chicago City Council","Nondenominational Christian","Bobby Lee Rush (born November 23, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 1st congressional district, serving since 1993. The district is located principally on the South Side of Chicago with its population percentage being 65% African-American, higher than any other congressional district in the nation.
A member of the Democratic Party, he holds the distinction of being the only person to defeat President Barack Obama in an election, as he did in the 2000 Democratic primary for Illinois' 1st congressional district.


Rush was born on November 23, 1946 in Albany, Georgia. After his mother and father separated when he was 7, Rush, his siblings and their mother moved to Chicago, Illinois.[1] In 1963 after dropping out of high school, Rush joined the U.S. Army. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1968, he went AWOL from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. He later received an honorable discharge from the Army.[2]
Throughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the civil-rights movement and worked in civil-disobedience campaigns in the Southern United States. After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers in 1968, he served as its defense minister.[3] After witnessing fellow Black Panther Fred Hampton being killed in a police raid, Rush made statements saying ""We needed to arm ourselves"" and referring to the police as ""pigs"".[4] Earlier that same year Rush stated the philosophy behind his membership in the Black Panthers saying, ""Black people have been on the defensive for all these years. The trend now is not to wait to be attacked. We advocate offensive violence against the power structure.""[5] Despite the group's engagement in violence, Rush nonetheless worked on several non-violent projects that built support for the Black Panthers in African-American communities, such as coordinating a medical clinic which offered sickle-cell anemia testing on an unprecedented scale.[6]
Rush's own apartment was raided in December 1969, where police discovered an unregistered pistol, rifle, shotgun, pistol ammunition, training manuals on explosives, booby traps, an assortment of communist literature, and a small amount of marijuana.[7] Rush was imprisoned for six months in 1972 on a weapons charge, after carrying a pistol into a police station. In 1974 Rush left the Panthers, who were already in decline. ""We started glorifying thuggery and drugs,"" he told People. Rush, a deeply religious born-again Christian, went on to say that ""I don't repudiate any of my involvement in the Panther partyit was part of my maturing.""[8]
In 1973, Rush earned his Bachelor of Arts with honors in liberal arts from Roosevelt University, and went on to earn his Master's degree in political science from University of Illinois at Chicago in 1974, and in theological studies from McCormick Theological Seminary in 1978.
Rush ran for a seat on the Chicago City Council in 1974, the first of several black militants who later sought political office, and was defeated. In the early 1980s however, Chicago's political life was transformed by the ascendancy of U.S. Representative Harold Washington, a noted orator and a charismatic figure who helped unite the city's African-American community. Washington was elected Mayor of Chicago in 1983, the first African-American to ever hold the office. That same year, Rush was elected alderman from the Second Ward on Chicago's South Side. He was a part of the pro-Harold Washington faction on the Council during the ""Council Wars"" that began in 1983 following Washington's election as Mayor in a racially-polarized contest.
In 1999, Rush ran for Mayor of Chicago, but lost in the Democratic primary to incumbent Richard M. Daley.[9]
In 2013, Rush drew criticism for his own criticism of a plan set out by Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) who proposed 18,000 members of Chicago gang ""Gangster Disciples"" be arrested. Rush called Kirk's approach ""headline grabbing,"" and referred to it as an ""upper-middle-class, elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about."" In response, a spokesman for Kirk referred to the decades of experience Kirk had with it.[10]
After redistricting, Rush decided to run in the newly redrawn Illinois' 1st congressional district. He defeated incumbent U.S. Congressman Charles Hayes and six other candidates in the Democratic primary election in 1992.[11] He won the general election with 83% of the vote.[12]
In the 2000 Democratic primary for the Illinois' 1st congressional district, Rush was challenged by then-State Senator, Barack Obama.[13] During the primary, Rush said, ""Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it.""[14] Rush claimed that Obama was not sufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns.[15] For his part, Obama said Rush was a part of ""a politics that is rooted in the past"" and said he himself could build bridges with whites to get things done. But while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he didn't get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods.[16] Starting with just 10% name recognition, Obama went on to get only 30% of the vote, losing by a more than 2-to-1 margin despite winning among white voters; and Rush winning 61% overall.[17][18][19][20][21] Rush went on to win the general election with 88% of the vote.[22]
Rush has consistently won with high margins, winning above 80% in every election, with the exception being his first bid for re-election in 1994 and in 2012 after redistricting, with him still winning above 70% of the vote.
Bobby Rush has been considered a loyal Democrat during his tenure, in the 110th Congress, he voted with his party 97.8% of the time.[23] Rush is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Rush initiated the Chicago Partnership for the Earned Income Tax Credit, an ongoing program designed to help low-income working Chicago resident to receive the Earned Income Tax Credit, a federal income tax credits.
Rush sponsored the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act passed in 1999. The law temporarily addressed the nursing shortage by providing non-immigrant visas for qualified foreign nurses in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago and was reauthorized in 2005.
Rush sponsored the Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act, named for Melanie Blocker-Stokes, a Chicago native who jumped to her death from a 12th story window due to postpartum depression. The bill would provide for research on postpartum depression and psychosis and services for individuals suffering from these disorders.
The Children's Health Act, passed in 2000 incorporated Rush's Urban Asthma Reduction Act of 1999, amending the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program and includes an integrated approach to asthma management.
Rush was very outspoken against the GOP No More Solyndras Bill that would override a guarantee by the Energy Department. The Energy Department guaranteed a federal loan contract with the Solyndras company to help with research and development.[24] Rush made the comment that the No More Solyndras Bill would be better named as the ""No More Innovation Bill"".[25]
Rush introduced the ""Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009"" on January 6, 2009. The bill would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms to register for a federal firearms license. All sales of the subject firearms would have to go through a licensed dealer. It would also make it a criminal act not to register as an owner of a firearm.[26]
On July 15, 2004, Rush became the second sitting member of Congress, following Charles Rangel and preceding Joe Hoeffel, to be arrested for trespassing while protesting the genocide in Darfur and other violations of human rights in Sudan in front of the Sudanese Embassy.[27][28]
On February 13, 2007, Rush opposed President George W. Bush's proposed 20,000 serviceman troop surge in Iraq. He said the presence of the troops in Iraq is the greatest catalyst of violence in Iraq, and advocated a political resolution of the Iraq situation. Towards the close of his speech, Rush stated that the troop surge would only serve to make the Iraqi situation more volatile.[29]
On March 28, 2012, Rush addressed the House while wearing a hoodie in honor of Trayvon Martin, a teenager who was shot in Florida, and spoke against racial profiling.[30] As the House forbids its members from wearing hats, Rush was called out of order and escorted from the chamber.[31]
Together Rush and his wife Carolyn have had 6 children. One of their sons, Huey, named after Black Panther leader Huey Newton,[32] was murdered in Chicago at the age of 29.[33]
In 2008, Rush had a rare type of malignant tumor removed from his salivary gland.[34] Rush is a member of Iota Phi Theta.[35] According to a DNA analysis, he is descended mainly, from people of Ghana.[36]
Though a very close friend to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rush announced early on in the 2008 Democratic primaries that he would support Barack Obama.[37] After Obama won the Presidency and vacated his Senate seat, Rush proposed that an African-American should be appointed to fill his seat.[38] During a press conference, Rush said, ""With the resignation of President-elect Obama, we now have no African-Americans in the United States Senate, and we believe it will be a national disgrace to not have this seat filled by one of the many capable African-American Illinois politicians.""[39] Rush said he did not support any one individual in particular for Senate, and was not interested in being appointed himself.[38][39] On December 30, 2008, Governor Rod Blagojevich announced his appointment of Roland Burris, the former Attorney General of Illinois; Rush was present at the press conference and spoke in support of Burris.[40]"

Lipinski was born in Chicago, and is the son of Rose Marie (ne Lapinski) and former U.S. Congressman Bill Lipinski.[1] He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University in mechanical engineering (earned in 1988), a Master of Arts degree from Stanford University (1989) in engineering-economic systems, and a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University (1998). [2] During the summer of 1992, he interned at the United States Department of Labor. He served in that same capacity for U.S. Congressman George E. Sangmeister from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman Jerry Costello. He then served on Cook County State's Attorney Richard A. Devine's campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman Rod Blagojevich's staff, Lipinski served as a communication staff aide to then-House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.
From 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the University of Notre Dame. In 2001, he joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee, where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004.
Lipinski serves on two House Committees: Transportation & Infrastructure and Science, Space, & Technology.
Lipinski is the most senior member from Illinois on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Aviation and the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. In 2005 he secured $100 million in federal funding to initiate the CREATE rail modernization program, a public-private partnership designed to ease road and rail congestion in northeastern Illinois. In 2012, Lipinski helped pass the first federal highway and transit bill in seven years and the first Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization in nine years. He represents a district that includes federal highways, state tollways, Chicago's Midway Airport and Romeovilles Lewis University Airport, the Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal, four commuter rail lines, Amtrak, and six of the country's seven Class I freight railroads. Working with local leaders, he has worked to improve Metras SouthWest Service and Heritage Corridor lines.
On the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Lipinski is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research and sits on the Subcommittee on Energy. Lipinskis district includes Argonne National Laboratory, the first national laboratory in the United States and the largest facility of its kind in the Midwest. He has long supported investing in innovation and scientific research at universities, national labs, and other entities.
Like his father, Lipinski is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat by Chicago-area standards; his district has historically been the most conservative of the eight that divide Chicago (especially on social issues).[3] Lipinski did not endorse President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012[4]
As a former teacher, Lipinski has pushed for improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education throughout his career. As chairman of the Research Subcommittee, Lipinski helped write the legislation reauthorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as the America COMPETES Act. In 2007, Lipinski was a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee that completed work on the COMPETES Act, a response to a National Academies report warning that America must take action if it wants to maintain its place as the worlds scientific and technological leader.
Among Lipinskis other priorities are boosting domestic manufacturing and strengthening Buy American laws.
Lipinski is pro-life[5] and serves as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.[6] He is a co-sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.[7] In June 2013, Lipinski was one of only six Democrats in Congress who voted for a nationwide 20-week abortion ban.[8]
On April 29, 2009, Lipinski voted for the Hate Crimes Expansion bill, which expands the definition of hate crime and strengthens enforcement of hate-crime laws.[9] In December 2010 he voted in favor of repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[10] Lipinski opposes recognition of same-sex marriage.[11]
Lipinski introduced the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act on June 12, 2012.[12] The bill would require the government to implement policies that support manufacturing products that qualify for the ""Made in U.S.A label, such as the establishment of a Manufacturing Strategy Board within the Commerce Department that includes federal officials, two state governors from different parties, and nine private-sector leaders and stakeholders from the manufacturing industry.[13] The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012, by a bipartisan 339-77 vote.[12]
Lipinski has proposed what he calls a ""Five-Point Jobs Plan"". According to Lipinski, the plan would ""strengthen manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, educate the workforce, force other countries to trade fairly and invest in innovation.""[13]
On September 17, 2009, Lipinski voted yes on the Student Aid Program Modifications bill. It passed the House, 253-171.[14]
Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed the House on March 21, 2010.[15] He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion.[16] Lipinski had previously voted for a version of the bill that contained more stringent restrictions on abortion funding.[17]
In October 2013, Lipinski was the primary sponsor of HR3425, which would delay any penalties under the PPACA until four months after the program's website is fully functional.[18]
Lipinski has voted against giving undocumented immigrants in-state tuition, educational benefits, welfare and health care services, and has opposed the visa lottery. He also has voted against increases in permanent and temporary foreign work visas such as the H1-B.[19]
Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent. [20]
In 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Wardwhich is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rdhe was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic district.[21][22] As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the 2004 general election.
Lipinski was able to garner 55% of the vote in the 2006 primary against two Democratic opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.[23]
Before serving in Congress, Lipinski taught American Government at a number of colleges, including the University of Notre Dame. He also gained experience on Capitol Hill working for the House Administration Committee, the Democratic Policy Committee, and House members, including Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. Lipinski has also worked for the U.S. Department of Labor and the Illinois General Assembly's Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation.
Lipinski earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University, a Master's degree in Engineering-Economic Systems from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Duke University. He is one of only a dozen trained engineers in the 113th Congress.
Lipinski and his wife, Judy, reside in Western Springs. In their free time, they are avid runners, participating in numerous races each year, from two-mile sprints to half-marathons."

Gutirrez was the first Latino to be elected to Congress from the Midwest.[1] From 1986 until his election to Congress he served as a member of the Chicago City Council representing the 26th ward. He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He is recognized as the ""national leader on comprehensive immigration reform.""[2] In the 113th Congress, with his 20 years of service, Gutirrez became the longest serving member of the Illinois House delegation, and so is occasionally referred to as the unofficial ""dean"" of the delegation.[3][4]
Of Puerto Rican descent, he is a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, and the Vieques movement.[5] Gutirrez is also an outspoken advocate of workers' rights, LGBT rights, gender equality, and other liberal and progressive causes.[6][7] Gutirrez has been compared to civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., due to both figures' use of non-violent civil disobedience in their advocacy for the equal rights of their communities.[8] In 2010 Frank Sharry of America's Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said of Gutirrez: ""Hes as close as the Latino community has to a Martin Luther King figure.""[9] His supporters have given him the nickname El Gallito  the little fighting rooster  in reference to his fiery oratory and political prowess.[10]


Gutirrez was born and raised in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working class community. His mother was an assembly-line worker and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael's High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of San Sebastin, Puerto Rico. Gutirrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there he learned to speak Spanish. Gutirrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: ""In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then all of a sudden I land on the island and everyone calls me gringo and Americanito. I learned to speak Spanish well.""[10]
In 1974 Gutirrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at Northeastern Illinois University. He got involved in student activism and social justice issues, writing for the student publication Que Ondee Sola and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students.[11] In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his longtime girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida. The couple returned to Chicago in 1978 and, unable to find other work, Gutirrez took up taxi driving full-time.[12] Gutirrez eventually found work as a Chicago Public School teacher and later a child abuse caseworker with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services.[13]
In 1983 Gutirrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent Dan Rostenkowski for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election. To fund his campaign Gutirrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Gutirrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting on Gutirrez's early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the Chicago Tribune wrote: Gutirrez thought he could win. Washington's 1983 victory  the first local race Gutirrez had voted in  had left him wildly optimistic. Before that, he didn't think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government.""[10]
Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Gutirrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood. Gutirrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to quality for the ballot on his own. Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful House Ways & Means Committee soundly defeated Gutirrez, with 76% of the vote.[10]
Following Gutirrez's loss to Dan Rostenkowski he helped found the Cook County Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984. The coalition was meant to be a grassroots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the Cook County Democratic Party.[14]
Gutirrez's political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago's burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago's first African-American Mayor  Harold Washington  who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the Department of Streets and Sanitation.[10]
Gutirrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor  serving on the Mayor's committee on infrastructure.[15]
In October 1984 a Molotov cocktail came crashing through the front living room window of Gutirrez's home. For a period of three months following the firebombing his family lived in hotel rooms. The offenders were never identified, but Gutirrez attributed the attack to ""culprits from the right... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington.""[10]
In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington's political reform movement, Gutirrez founded the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO). Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization's kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.[10]
In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge Charles Norgle ordered a special election for March 18, 1986 in seven wards, including the 26th.[15] The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district. Gutirrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington. At the time of the election opponents to Washington's administration, led by Ed Vrdolyak of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council. This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as Council Wars. The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council. Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward. Manuel Torres, then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman. Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor Jane Byrne, future mayor and then State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, and machine Alderman Ed Burke and Dick Mell.[15]
Gutirrez's campaign volunteers were primarily women,""ex-hippies and... community activists-black, white and Hispanic.""[10] With the campaign theme: ""Church, Family, Community,"" support from Mayor Harold Washington  who donated $12,000 to Gutirrez  and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Gutirrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.[14][16]
On the eve of the Gutirrez-Torres run-off Spanish language television aired the candidates' final debate. Gutirrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Gutirrez's use of Spanish and his grassroots organizing are credited for his 53%47% victory over Torres. Gutirrez is reported to have said during the election: ""My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party. They're ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead.""[14][15]
Upon entering the Chicago City Council Gutirrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader and leader of the Latinos in the council.[15] Gutirrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: ""There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything. You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time. But I figured it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem, that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on. So when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean.""[15]
As a member of the city council Gutirrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance  which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender & sexual orientation. He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing. He was referred to as a ""workhorse in the city council"" by political author Marable Manning.[15]
In the 1987 municipal elections Gutirrez faced five opponents and be re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote.[15] Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Gutirrez voted for African-American Alderman Timothy C. Evans over machine-backed Alderman Eugene Sawyer. In the 1989 Mayoral election Gutirrez endorsed State's Attorney Richard M. Daley for Mayor, stating: ""I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas.""[17]
Under Daley's administration Gutirrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition and Leases and Council President pro tempore, presiding over meetings in the Mayor's absence.[10]
In 1990 a court order created a new ""earmuff-shaped"" majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs. Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary  Gutirrez, Alderman Dick Mell of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner Joseph Berrios, and Juan Soliz, former Alderman of 25th ward.[18] Mell, the only white candidate entered the race out of his ""personal dislike for Gutirrez."" [19] Gutirrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M. Daley, and all but one of his opponents, Juan Soliz, dropped out of the race.[18]
Despite the district's majority Mexican-American population and Soliz's highly negative campaign, Gutirrez won the Democratic primary 60%-40%.[19][20][21] At his election night victory party Gutirrez stated: ""If a Puerto Rican kid from Humboldt Park can go to the Congress of the United States, it shows the American dream is possible.""[21] Billy Ocasio was later tapped to replace Gutierrez in the Chicago City Council in January 1993. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Hildegarde Rodriguez-Schieman 78%-22%.[22]
In 1994 Gutierrez defeated Soliz in the primary by an even larger margin 64%-36%,[23] and won re-election to a second term in the general election with 75% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage in a general election in his career.[24] From 1996 to 2008, Gutirrez won re-election seven times, each time with more than 80% of the vote.[25] In 2010, he won re-election to his tenth term with 77% of the vote.[26]
In 2009 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi appointed Gutirrez Chair of the Democratic Caucus Immigration Task Force. He continues to serve as the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force. In these roles he has served as the Congress's ""leading strategist and spokesperson on immigration issues.""[13]
The representative of a culturally diverse district, he has run programs on a local level to increase education levels and knowledge of the English language among immigrants.[13] He has run workshops within his district, which have helped more than 50,000 people begin the process of becoming US citizens.[5] Gutirrez's district office was the first congressional office to seek and receive community organization designation as a result of the depth and breath of constituent services they provide.[13]
In February 2009, Gutirrez introduced H.R. 1214, the ""Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009,"" co-sponsored by other members of the House of Representatives, including members of the House leadership. H.R. 1214 would cap the annual percentage rate (APR) for payday loans at 391 percent in the 23 states where it is now allowed to exceed 391 percent.[27][28][29]
Gutirrez was also a principal backer of the Dodd-Frank bill that created the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[13]
Gutirrez has been called the ""undisputed champion of immigration reform"" and ""Moses of the Latinos"" due to his many years advocating for immigrant rights.[30] [31]
In his continued efforts to reform immigration Gutirrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House. The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Gutirrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested. Many of the protesters who joined Gutirrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona  SB 1070. Gutirrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.[32]
On July 26, 2011 in response to a record breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President's continued refusal to stave deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Gutirrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside of the White House. A crowd of 2,500 came to support Gutirrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest President Obama sent a letter to Gutirrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration's deportation policy.[33]
In 2009 and again in 2011 Gutirrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families. The tours have received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform. Gutirrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010 March for America rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.[34]
Gutirrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the DREAM Act  legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship  in 2001.[13] In 2009 Gutirrez introduced CIR-ASAP  Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act  a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security. The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and organized labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Food and Commercial Workers and the Service Employees International Union.[35] He described the bill before a Washington DC rally:
My bill will promote fair immigration proceedings, humane treatment of immigration detainees, and policies that respect the tenet of community policing. No more raids in our community, no more separation of our families. Now, none of this works without a strong commitment to Americas labor force. None of it works without a strong commitment. So one of the tenets of our bill will be comprehensive immigration reform, has to meanhas to meanto protecting all workers.
Following CIR-ASAP's defeat in the Congress, Gutirrez has been a main backer of the DREAM Act in the House.[13]
While he was a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Gutirrez that made treatment and counseling available to veterans that have been victims of sexual trauma.[13] Gutirrez also successfully expanded health care coverage to those exposed to Agent Orange and high levels of radiation during military service.[13]
Gutirrez's assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional health care and prosthetic funding for veterans.[13]
Gutirrez has been an outspoken advocate for human and civil rights of the Puerto Rican people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s he was a leader in the Vieques movement, which sought to stop the United States military from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000 Gutirrez was one of nearly two-hundred arrested for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range.[37]
In 2011 Gutirrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island  specifically police brutality perpetrated against University of Puerto Rico students critical of the island's government and a law passed by the Fortuo government that sought to limit student's freedom of speech. Gutirrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island's lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.[38][39]
Gutirrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand workers' rights. In 2008 Gutirrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based Republic Windows and Doors during their successful sit-in. The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system. He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with Bank of America.[40] Gutirrez views his advocacy for workers' rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.[41]
In 1994 Gutirrez was a vocal opponent of NAFTA and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers' collective bargaining rights.[42]
When the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) declared their plan to close down the Douglas Branch of the then Blue Line  which primarily serves working-class Latino communities  Gutirrez successfully secured $320 million in federal funding to reconstruct Blue Line stops and pressed the CTA to re-instate full service.[13] The Douglas Branch is now known as the Pink Line (CTA).
With a background as a community activist and organizer Gutirrez often uses non-violent civil disobedience when pushing political causes and legislation. He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform.[32][37] In 2010 and 2011 he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama.
Gutirrez's progressive political stances make him a favorite target of Right-wing political commentators. Michael Savage often attacks Gutirrez and his political stances on the conservative talk radio program Savage Nation.[43]
Since 2008 Gutirrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] In a May 2010 article, Jonathan Rosa, professor of Social and Cultural Studies at New York University, criticized these reports from the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times as ""deceitful"" and ""part of a larger, longstanding effort to discredit Luis Gutierrez."" [53][54]
Upon arriving to the United States House of Representatives Gutirrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda. He sent each one a copy of the book Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won't Stop. As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class Gutirrez was passed up by the House leadership for his first choice of the Ways and Means Committee and his second choice of the Education Committee; instead he was assigned to the Banking Committee and Veterans' Affairs. In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Gutirrez charged that then House Speaker Tom Foley was ""not a reformer in any sense.""[55]
Congressman Gutirrez sits on the following House Committees:
Gutirrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the 110th and 111th Congress,[56] serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee.[57] During that same period of time he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.[13]
Gutirrez' name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for Mayor of Chicago. In 2006 he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent Richard M. Daley, but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.
After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Gutirrez' name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate. In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race students formed chapters of ""Students for Luis Gutirrez"" at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October Gutirrez removed his name from consideration stating: ""I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I've already begun. I have unfinished business to complete,"" in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.[58]
Gutirrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Gutirrez for over thirty years. Together they have two daughters  Omaira and Jessica. Jessica's middle name  Washington  comes from the late Mayor Harold Washington, a close friend and mentor of Gutirrez.[10] Soraida battled and survived cancer in the 2000s.[59]
Roberto Maldonado, 26th ward alderman and former Cook County Commissioner, is Gutirrez' former brother-in-law.[60][61]
Gutirrez is an avid golf player.[62]"

University of Chicago","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Quigley_(politician)","Mike Quigley","Democratic","Cook County Board of Commissioners","Roman Catholic","Michael ""Mike"" Quigley (born October 17, 1958) is the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 5th congressional district, serving since the April 7, 2009 special election. The district includes most of Chicago's North Side, as well as several of the city's western suburbs. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Quigley is a former member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, where he represented Chicago's northside neighborhoods of Lakeview, Uptown and Rogers Park. He also teaches environmental policy and Chicago politics at Loyola University Chicago.


Quigley was raised in Carol Stream, Illinois where he graduated from Glenbard North High School in 1977. He then attended Roosevelt University where he earned his bachelor's degree. Quigley moved into the Lakeview area of Chicago in 1982 and became involved in community activities. He attended the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where he earned a juris doctor, and the University of Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in public policy.
Quigley was first elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1998. During his tenure he has gained a reputation as a reformer as he opposed tax hikes supported by Cook County Board President John Stroger, and later his son and successor Todd Stroger. He contended the county could operate more efficiently and he presented reports to support the position. Quigley also challenged the practice of finding jobs for Democratic officials with the Cook County Forest Preserve District.[1]
Quigley and his wife Barbara have two daughters, Alyson and Meghan.
In early 2009, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Rahm Emanuel of Illinois's 5th congressional district decided to resign in order to become the White House Chief of Staff to newly elected President Barack Obama. The vacancy lead to the special election to succeed him. Quigley was one of twelve candidates to file for the special Democratic primary. Mike was endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times, which called him ""a constant advocate for fiscal responsibility and a watchdog against waste and corruption"".[2] He was also endorsed by the Chicago Tribune, which cited Quigley's efforts to improve county government, noting ""If Quigley's ideas had all been put in place, the county would not be crying now for more money"".[3] He won the March special primary with 22% of the vote. The candidate who ranked second, State Representative John Fritchey received 18% of the vote, four points short.[4] After that, Quigley won the April special election with 69% of the vote.[5]
Quigley won re-election to his first full term in 2010 with 71% of the vote.[6]
After redistricting, his district was placed with fellow U.S. Congressperson Republican Judy Biggert and became slightly less safe. However, Biggert decided not to run for re-election in the 5th, as the district is still safely Democratic as Obama won the district with 70% (down three points from the current 5th) and 2010 Democratic U.S. Senator nominee Alexi Giannoulias won carried the 5th with 55% of the vote.[7] No Democrat has filed to run against him. Only one Republican filed, self-employed businessman Dan Schmitt.[8]
In May 2011, Quigley sponsored an amendment to the Patriot Act prohibiting the sale of weapons to those on the FBIs Terrorist Watch List.[9] Quigley believed that the Republican limitation of civil liberties under the Patriot Act contradicted their unwillingness to limit Second Amendment rights. This bill, proposed as an amendment to the Patriot Act, came under fire from House Republicans Reps. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin and Louie Gohmert of Texas who argued that this would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those mistakenly placed on the Terrorist Watch List. However, in a vote dictated by political party, the bill lost 2111 with the House Judiciary panel.[9]
Quigley has received a rating of 100 (on a scale of 1 to 100) from the American Public Health Association, indicating his strong support of healthcare legislation. In April 2011, Quigley voted against Paul Ryans budget plan (which involved budget cuts to Medicare as well as decreased government funding to help citizens procure health insurance). Also in April 2011, Quigley voted against repealing the Prevention and Public Health fund, a fund focused on Community and Clinical Prevention of chronic diseases, as well as allotting money towards healthcare infrastructure and research. Quigley also voted for increases in government spending on physical and occupational therapy.
A Sierra Club member since high school, Quigley initially joined politics because of his desire to help the environment through legislation. Quigley has enacted this desire through supporting the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a 2009 bill to create an emissions trading plan which passed in the House of Representatives but was defeated in the Senate. Quigley also introduced the Federal Birdsafe Buildings Bill, a 2011 initiative to make all buildings built by the General Services Administration built with the maximum amount of bird-safe materials and features. In April 2011, Quigley voted to prohibit invasive research on great apes.
Quigley is a supporter of veterans' benefits and has worked to improve healthcare and education opportunities for them.[10] His district office is also known to make services available to veterans whenever they should need it, such as helping one veteran receive medals that he had been waiting for over twenty years to receive.[11] In 2013 Quigley introduced a bill to the House to prevent Veterans from entering into debt to pay for tuition before GI benefits are received. He hopes to provide even greater educational opportunities to veterans with this bill.[12]
Quigley supports abortion on demand, and voted against banning federal health coverage for abortions.[13] Quigley also supports federal funding for family planning and education, as well as creating more preventative steps to avoid unwanted pregnancies altogether.[10]
Quigley is a supporter of LGBT rights and showed his support in 2012 by participating in National Coming Out Day as a show of solidarity.[13][14] He has called for the FDA to revoke its ban on allowing blood donations from gays.[14]
In 2007 Quigley was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.[15]"

He is a member of the Republican Party and served as the Chief Deputy Majority Whip from 2011 to 2014, ranking fourth among House Republican leaders. He has also served in the Illinois Senate and the Illinois House of Representatives. He currently serves as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight.


Roskam was born in Hinsdale, Illinois. He was the fourth of five children and was raised in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, graduating from Glenbard West High School. Roskam received his B.A. in political science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his J.D. from the Chicago-Kent College of Law.
In 1984, Roskam taught history and government at All Saints High School in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. From 1985 to 1986, Roskam served as a legislative assistant to Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX),[1] and from 1986 to 1987 as a legislative assistant to Rep. Hyde.[1][2] In the late 1980s, Roskam served as the Executive Director of Educational Assistance Ltd., a scholarship program for disadvantaged children founded by his father in 1982.[3] In 1992, Roskam was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, serving from 1993 to 1999. In 2000, he was appointed by DuPage County Republican leaders to replace the retiring Beverly Fawell[4] in the Illinois State Senate where he served until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Roskam resides in Wheaton, Illinois with his wife Elizabeth and their four children. His children are Gracey, Frankie, Steve and A.J.[5]
Roskam was a partner in the law firm Salvi, Roskam & Maher, a personal injury firm. He was named ""Best Oral Advocate"" by the American College of Trial Lawyers. The firm, now called Salvi & Maher, is politically notable because former Republican Senate candidate Al Salvi and former Republican House candidate Kathy Salvi are also partners in the firm. The Chicago Tribune noted that Roskam earned over $615,000 in 2005 as a personal injury trial lawyer.[6]
After his parents took a trip to Vietnam and saw American veterans' dog tags for sale on the street, Roskam, along with his parents worked to return the dog tags to their owners or the families of the deceased.[7]
Roskam served in the Illinois General Assembly as a Representative from 1993 to 1998, and Senator from 2000 to 2006. In the Senate, Roskam served as the Republican Whip, the Republican spokesman on the Executive Committee, and a member of the Rules Committee, Environment and Energy Committee, Insurance and Pensions Committee, and Judiciary Committee. In the Senate, Roskam sponsored legislation giving the Supreme Court of Illinois authority to reverse a death penalty sentence, has sponsored legislation increasing the penalties for repeat D.U.I. offenders, and was the lead sponsor of a law to maintain courts' power to hold deadbeat parents in contempt to ensure child support.[2] Roskam has authored or co-authored fourteen bills to cut taxes.[8]
Roskam asked the Illinois Comptroller's office for a list of state employees in 1998, when Al Salvi was running for Illinois Secretary of State . At the time, Roskam told the Chicago Tribune that the request was for personal use. However, according to a report in the Arlington Heights Daily Herald, Roskam gave the list to Salvi, who used the list to send numbered campaign fundraising tickets to state employees. The numbering allowed the campaign to keep track of who contributed and who didn't.[9]
In January 2005, Roskam fought amending the Illinois Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation on the grounds that it would require churches and religious organizations to hire homosexuals.[10] However, the act contains an explicit exemption for churches and religious organizations.[11] The Illinois Senate passed the amendment 30-27-1[12] and on January 1, 2006, Illinois became the 16th state to have such a law.[13]
In November 2004, Roskam voted against State Comptroller Dan Hynes's $1 billion proposal to raise taxes on cosmetic surgery to fund stem cell research.[14] The proposal was defeated 29-28-1 in the Illinois Senate.[15][16]
Congressman Peter Eugene Roskam served as Chief Deputy Whip in the 112th Congress,[17] ranking fourth among house Republican leaders.[18]
He and Arizona Democrat Gabrielle Giffords were periodically interviewed together on NPR's All Things Considered during their first term as to their experiences as freshmen members of Congress.[19]
On July 26, 2013, the House Committee on Ethics released a public statement that Roskam was under investigation by Committee regarding allegations of a 2011 trip to Taiwan with his wife that was improperly financed by the Taiwanese government.[20][21][22][23] The case was closed in November 2013 citing ""insufficient evidence"" of wrongdoing.
Roskam opposes abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is at risk, making no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.[25][26]
In March 2007, Roskam announced a $3 million Department of Energy grant to the Des Plaines-based Gas Technology Institute (GTI).[27] In June 2007, Roskam supported a bill (H. R. 2619) to authorize $2.5 million per year for 2009-2011 to establish and operate an ethanol anti-idling power unit research program. Roskam noted that GTI would be eligible for the grant[28] as would any other 501(c)(3) organization that ""has performed energy-related research"". No further action was taken on the bill in 2007 after it was referred to Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation in mid June.[29]
Later, Roskam voted against legislation boosting automobile fuel economy requirements to an industry average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The bill also encouraged the use of renewable fuels.[30] On June 24, 2008, Roskam voted against H.R. 6346: The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. The bill failed when it was voted on following a suspension of normal rules to stop debate and it required a 2/3 vote to pass.[31][32] Opponents of the bill said that price gouging is not widespread and that it is difficult to prove that it occurred.[33] Roskam stated he voted against the bill as a protection of the free market.[34]
Roskam, with Rep. John Shimkus, has proposed the Energy VISION Act that promises to all-but end America's foreign energy addiction within 15 years. According to the Baltimore Sun, ""The plan mixes conservation and alternative fuel production with aggressive domestic energy exploration, including drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and opening vast swaths of land to oil shale development."" [35]
In 2013, the League of Conservation Voters gave Roskam an environmental rating of 4%, and a lifetime rating of 10%.[36] In 2005, he received a 67% rating from the Illinois Environmental Council. In 2004 he scored 100%, while in 2003 he scored 40%.[37]
Roskam sponsored an Illinois state Senate bill which would have allowed retired military and police personnel to carry concealed weapons. He has gained National Rifle Association (NRA) endorsement for being a supporter of gun rights. On July 15, 2006, Roskam was the featured guest at an NRA support rally for him in Addison, Illinois.[38]
In his first year in Congress, Roskam secured ""more than $50 million federal dollarsto expand health care facilities and programs and improve traffic congestion."" This included $195,000 to fund the expansion of the new emergency room at Adventist GlenOaks Hospital in Glendale Heights and $243,000 to expand mental health programs at the Access Community Health Networks Martin T. Russo Family Health Center in Bloomingdale.[39][40]
On September 25, 2007, Roskam voted with the majority of his party against expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. This bill would have increased funding for the program to $60 billion over the next five years and provided health insurance for 9 million uninsured American children (including those whose families made up to $83,000 a year and had access to insurance through their jobs). The bill passed Congress but was vetoed by President Bush.[41]
In interviews on National Public Radio, Roskam stated his opposition to the Senate's Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 and stated support for the House immigration reform bill, H.R. 4437 the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. During the interviews he claimed his constituency did not support amnesty and wanted stronger border security.[42][43]
On September 21, 2006, Roskam said that the U.S. should ""stay the course"" and that U.S. troops should not return home until Iraq is safe.[44] He criticized his opponent Tammy Duckworth (an Iraq veteran)'s views on withdrawal, saying ""the Sixth District is not a cut-and-run district."" On October 23, 2006, Roskam said it was a mistake the U.S. didn't go in with full force in Iraq. Later, Roskam expressed support for quarterly status reports to Congress on Iraqi troop training.[45]
Roskam supported the 2007 escalation in troops in Iraq, saying, ""There are encouraging reports coming out of Iraq that Baghdad is becoming more secure, and the insurgency is being mitigated. This is a pivotal time. Iraqis need to seize this opportunity to provide security for themselves so we can begin to reduce our troop numbers on the ground.""[46]
According to his website, Roskam opposes plans to expand O'Hare International Airport, and instead favors building a third regional airport in Chicago's southern suburbs.[47] However, O'Hare expansion begun during Roskam's tenure and the new runway opened in 2008.[48]
On July 1, 2008, Roskam announced plans to introduce legislation preventing the acquisition of the EJ&E Railway by the CN Railway by designating ""a 36-mile stretch of the EJ&E as a Corridor for Inter-Suburban Commuter Rail"" for use in Metra's STAR line.[49] Roskam introduced H.R. 6476 on July 10, 2008 with co-sponsors Judy Biggert and Donald A. Manzullo.[50] Roskam claims this would be the nation's first suburb to suburb commuter rail line.[51]
Roskam adamantly opposes President Obama's planned relocation of Guantanamo Bay detention camp inmates to Thomson Correctional Center in Thompson, Illinois, calling it ""a misguided decision that will ultimately be regretted.""[52]
On May 20, 2005, Roskam and six other Illinois senators missed a vote in the Illinois Senate on a non-binding resolution urging the United States Congress to protect Social Security and reject private accounts. The resolution passed 32-19-1, but no action was taken in the Illinois House.[53] Roskam has said in a WBBM post debate press conference, ""I am against privatizing Social Security, I am against raising taxes for Social Security benefits, and I'm against benefit reductions for Social Security.[54]
According to a direct mailing by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Peter Roskam will protect Social Security by opposing any plans that reduce benefits. Roskam told The Hill that he opposes any measures that would add private savings accounts or slice up the current program to create a private account. However, Roskam responded to a National Taxpayers Union questionnaire stating he would ""work and vote for Social Security Choice that will allow younger workers to have the choice of investing much of their Social Security taxes in regulated individual retirement accounts.""[55]
On January 12, 2007, Roskam voted with the majority of his party against the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower covered Part D drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.[56]
Roskam supports adult and umbilical cord stem cell research.[57] Roskam has argued against embryonic stem cell research in the Illinois Senate, even if privately funded,[58] and voted against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in Congress.[59]
Roskam advocates making permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts,[60] and has sponsored or cosponsored fourteen pieces of legislation for lower taxes, including child tax credits and reducing the income tax, and has stated support for a research and development tax credit. As an Illinois General Assembly legislator, Roskam authored and supported several pieces of tax reduction legislation.[61] Americans for Tax Reform named Roskam ""Hero of the Taxpayer"" in 2005 for his opposition to HB-755[62] which would have raised income and sales taxes by 67% or nearly $7 billion.[63]
In 2010 Roskam signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[64]
Roskam helped to pass the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, which prohibits the U.S. Department of Transportation from granting Mexican trucks access beyond the U.S./Mexico commercial zone until the department complies with the safety and security regulations Congress has already enacted.[65]
Roskam also supports the death penalty, opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions,[66][67] and supports allowing the use of earmarks in federal budgeting.[68]
Roskam has consistently voted for lawsuit reform, and has been endorsed by pro-tort reform organizations [69] During a 1995 push for tort reform in the Illinois General Assembly, Roskam voted for the reform measure despite promises to the contrary. Terrence Lavin, a member of the Illinois Bar Association who became its president in 2003, said that Al Salvi and Roskam promised, ""We will never, ever vote for tort reform"", when they solicited a $25,000 donation to a political action committee. Roskam later reimbursed much of the money collected after he voted to support the reforms.[6]
He supports CAFTA.[70]
In November 2006, Roskam expressed opposition to raising the national minimum wage from $5.15 per hour, referring to possible effect on small businesses,[71] and voted against a bill to increase the national minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour over two years in Congress.[72]
Roskam is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined ""unlawful Internet gambling"").[citation needed]
Roskam ran for Congress in 1998 in Illinois' 13th congressional district to replace retiring Congressman Harris W. Fawell, but lost in the Republican primary to state Representative Judy Biggert, who went on to win the general election. Roskam received 40% of the vote to Biggert's 45%.[73]
In 1999, at Biggert's request, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) investigated a mailing sent out by a political action committee (PAC), the Campaign for Working Families (CWF), in support of Peter Roskam. The FEC did not find the Roskam campaign at fault, but CWF was found to have violated election law. The PAC was led by conservative activist Gary Bauer.[74]
In March 2006, Roskam, running unopposed, won the Republican nomination to attempt to fill Henry Hyde's open seat.[2] His opponent in the November general election was an Iraq War veteran, Democrat Tammy Duckworth. Hyde endorsed Roskam. The competitive race was called ""the nation's most-watched congressional contest"" by Eric Krol of the Daily Herald.[75] The candidates debated on WTTW/Channel 11 (October 23), WBEZ radio (October 19), WBBM radio (September 24), and at the College of DuPage (12 October).[76]
Roskam was endorsed by the Teamsters labor union,[77] The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150, and The Veterans of Foreign Wars. On November 7, 2006, Roskam defeated Duckworth by a margin of 51% to 49%.[78]
In March, 2008, Roskam was again nominated to run for the IL-6 seat in the Republican Primary. He was opposed by Democrat Jill Morgenthaler.
In late October, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Roskam launched a new website at ObamaVotersForRoskam.com. The website displayed a fragment of a quotation from Democratic Presidential front-runner Barack Obama which seemed to indicate that Obama admires Roskam.[79] The portion of the Obama quotation omitted by Roskam goes: ""Having said that, have I said that he's wrong? I love him, but he's wrong."" The Daily Herald called the website a ""... move to grab a hold of Obama's coattails ...""[80] The TV show Hardball with Chris Matthews featured a segment on Roskam's website.[81] The Morgenthaler campaign pointed out that Obama supports Morgenthaler, not Roskam.[82] However, Roskam won re-election, by a 16% margin (58% to 42%).[83]
Peter Roskam defeated Democratic nominee Ben Lowe by a 27% margin in the 2010 midterm election.[84]
Roskam defeated Democratic nominee Leslie Coolidge, a former partner at KPMG by an 18.4% margin in the 2012 election.[85]
Roskam defeated Democratic nominee Michael Mason, a retired postal manager by a 34% margin in the 2014 general election.[86]"

(Danny) Davis (born September 6, 1941) is the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 7th congressional district, serving since 1997. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Davis was born in Parkdale, Arkansas, and educated at Arkansas AM&N College (B.A. in history, 1961), Chicago State University (M.S. in guidance, 1968) and the Union Institute & University in Cincinnati, Ohio (Ph.D. in public administration, 1977).[1] Davis worked as a government clerk, a high school teacher, executive director of the Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission, director of training at the Martin L. King Neighborhood Health Center, and executive director of the Westside Health Center before entering politics, where he represented Chicago's 29th Ward. He challenged Congresswoman Cardiss Collins in Democratic primaries in 1984 and 1986, but lost both races. Davis was then elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, serving from 1990 to 1996 before entering the House.[2] Davis had also waged an unsuccessful campaign against Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in the 1991 Democratic mayoral primary.
He is married to Vera G. Davis. They have two children, Jonathan and Stacey.[3] His niece, Quinshaunta Golden, achieved prominence as chief of staff at the Illinois Department of Public Health, under the direction of Eric E. Whitaker.
Davis is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus,[4] Progressive Caucus, and Democratic Socialists of America.[5][6]
Davis was one of 31 U.S. Representatives who voted against counting the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[7]
On December 6, 1995, Davis announced his candidacy for the 7th Congressional District, adding his name to the already announced Democratic candidates including Alderman Percy Z. Giles, Bobbie L. Steele, Ed Smith, and Dorothy Tillman.[8] Five other Democratic candidates entered the race later: S. Mendenhall, Joan Sullivan, G. Winbush, Anthony Travis, and Joan Powell, making it the largest field of candidates for U.S. Congress in Illinois for 1996.[9] Davis resided a block outside the 7th Congressional District, but he was familiar in the district,[10] and actual residency was not required[11] Davis ran on the progressive Democratic platform popular in the district. He was pro-choice and supported gay rights, the ERA, single-payer health care, and some federal support for child nutrition and care.[10]
In early January 1996, the FBI revealed its Operation Silver Shovel, which included an investigation into Alderman Percy Z. Giles.[12] What Operation Silver Shovel may have done to undermine Giles's chances for election are unclear as he was already lagging with a mere 3% among likely Democratic primary voters in a mid-December poll compared to Davis 33%, Smiths 8%, Tillmans 7%, and Steeles 6%.[13] However, up until Operation Silver Shovel Giles did have Mayor Richard M. Daley's support and that of other well-known area figuressome of whom continued their support during the controversy.[14]
On March 10, 1995, during a radio debate hosted by WMAQ-AM, Tillman and Smith called for Davis to reject the endorsement of former alderman candidate Wallace ""Gator"" Bradley,[15] spokesman for convicted Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover.[14] ""Why do you keep badgering me with this question? You got a problem with something? You're not going to catch me going around saying I hate Gator Bradley I'm not in the business of disavowing individuals. The good Lord said he hated sin, but not sinners. I'm not hating Gator Bradley. I disagree with those who commit crime and those who'd use drugs, but you won't catch me going around saying that I hate Gator Bradley."" [14] Davis never rejected Bradleys endorsement during the campaign and after winning the primary claimed that Bradleys endorsement played no role in the outcome, though Bradley asserted the contrary.[16]
During the campaign, Tillman highlighted comments Davis made in an August 1970 issue of Ebony: (T)he white female often gives the black man certain kinds of recognition that the black woman often does not give him.""[17] The Davis campaign countered that Davis was speaking as a psychologist in his role as a training director at a health center.[17]
Although Davis was fully promoted as a Democratic candidate, he also ran as a New Party candidate.[18][19][20] Supporting this was New Partys celebration of him as the first New Party member elected to the U.S. Congress.[21] Although the State of Illinois did not permit fusion voting, New Party advocated fusion voting as a means to promote their party and party agenda and to particularly project New Party ideology into the mainstream Democratic Party.[22] Candidates were referred to as N[ew]P[arty] Democrats[22] and were required to sign a contract mandating a visible and active relationship with New Party.[23] During this timeframe, New Party was experiencing substantial growth.[24]
Davis also received the endorsement of the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America (CDSA)[25] of which he is a member[26][27] and had a relationship pre-dating his congressional run.[28] ACORN, AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, and International Brotherhood of Teamsters are included in other groups also endorsing Davis in his bid.[29]
In the March 20 Democratic primaries, Davis received more votes than the two closest candidates  Tillman and Smith  combined.[9] The first five announced candidates all received more than double the five late-entering candidates with none of the latter receiving more than 2,700 votes.[9] In the November 5 general election, Davis won with over 82 percent of the votes cast over Republican Randy Borow and third-party candidates Chauncey L. Stroud (Independent), Toietta Dixon (Libertarian), and Charles A. Winter (Natural Law).[30]
Davis expressed interest in being President Barack Obama's replacement in the U.S. Senate, and Illinois Governor in late 2008 before his own major scandal erupted.[31] In a December 31, 2008, article published on the website of The New York Times, Davis said that he turned down an offer from representatives of Blagojevich to appoint him to the Senate.[32] Instead, Blagojevich appointed Roland W. Burris.[33]
In 2004, Davis was met with national controversy when he crowned the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon in a religious ceremony at the Dirksen Senate Office Building honoring the controversial spiritual leader.[34][35] Moon declared himself the Messiah at the crowning ceremony, in which Davis appeared on the invitation as a sponsoring co-chair.[35] Davis wore white gloves and carried the crown on a pillow to crown Moon and his wife ""the King and Queen of Peace.""[36] Davis told Christian Challenge that Moon declaring himself the Messiah ""was similar to a baseball team owner telling team members that 'we are the greatest team on earth'"" prior to a baseball game. Davis said the peace awards were to ""recognize people for promoting peace. Of course the highest recognition goes to the highest promoter and the highest promoter is Reverend Moon, so they come up with something higher than the certificates and plaques that other folks get.""[35] Other lawmakers who attended included Senator Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), Representatives Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), as well as former Representative Walter Fauntroy (D-D.C.) . Key organizers of the event included George Augustus Stallings, Jr., a controversial former Roman Catholic priest who had been married by Moon, and Michael Jenkins, the president of the Unification Church of the United States at that time.[37] Salon later said that Davis was the only member of Congress in attendance who took pride in the ceremony, and that he has accepted money from fundraisers organized by Moon.[4]
In 2003, Davis gave a speech on the House floor and praised Moon, along with Congressman Curt Weldon. Davis said, ""Many of my colleagues will join me and the gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr. Weldon, co-chair, in giving tribute to some of the outstanding Americans from our districts. We are grateful to the founders of Ambassadors for Peace, the Reverend and Mrs. Sun Myung [Moon], for promoting the vision of world peace, and we commend them for their work.""[4]
As the 15th most prolific traveler in Congress, Davis stirred up controversy by accepting a trip to Sri Lanka in 2005 on behalf of the Tamil minority there, paid for by the Tamil Tigers, a group that the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization for its use of suicide bombers and child soldiers. Davis said that he was unaware that the Tigers were the source of the trip's funding.[38]
Davis is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[39] Davis is notable for his support of the National Federation of the Blind. He spoke at their conventions in 2004 and 2005.[citation needed]"

A Democrat, she is the first Asian American woman elected to Congress in Illinois, the first disabled woman to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.
Duckworth previously served as Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs from April 24, 2009 to June 30, 2011, and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs from November 21, 2006 to February 8, 2009.
An Iraq War veteran, Duckworth served as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot and suffered severe combat wounds, losing both of her legs and damaging her right arm. She was the first female double amputee from the war.[1] Having received a medical waiver, she continued to serve as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard along with her husband, Major Bryan W. Bowlsbey, a signal officer and fellow Iraq War veteran.[2] Duckworth retired from the army in October 2014, and was reelected to Congress in November.


Tammy Duckworth was born in Bangkok, Thailand, to Frank and Lamai Duckworth. Her American father, Franklin, who died in 2005,[3] was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who traced his family's roots in the Americas back to before the Revolutionary War. Her mother, Lamai, who is Thai, has Chinese ancestry.[4] Because of her father's work with the United Nations and international companies, the family moved around Southeast Asia. Duckworth became fluent in Thai and Indonesian, in addition to English.[5]
The family settled in Hawaii when she was sixteen. Duckworth attended Singapore American School, and for a few months in her senior year was at the International School Bangkok. She graduated with honors from McKinley High School in 1985, after skipping the ninth grade. She graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science, and received a Master of Arts in international affairs from George Washington University.[6]
Following in the footsteps of her father and ancestors, who served in the Revolutionary War, World War II, and the Vietnam War,[4] Duckworth joined the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a graduate student at George Washington University in 1990. She became a commissioned officer in the United States Army Reserve in 1992 and chose to fly helicopters because it was one of the few combat jobs open to women. As a member of the Army Reserve, she went to flight school, later transferring to the Army National Guard and entering the Illinois Army National Guard in 1996.[7]
Duckworth was working towards a Ph.D. in political science at Northern Illinois University, with research interests in the political economy and public health in southeast Asia, when she was deployed to Iraq in 2004.[8] She lost her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee[9] from injuries sustained on November 12, 2004, when the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents.[10] She is the first female double amputee from the Iraq war.[1] The explosion ""almost completely destroyed her right arm, breaking it in three places and tearing tissue from the back side of it.""[11] Duckworth received a Purple Heart on December 3 and was promoted to Major on December 21 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she was presented with an Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.[10]

Duckworth was appointed Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs by Governor Rod Blagojevich[14][15][16] from November 21, 2006 to February 8, 2009. She was honored by Chicago's Access Living for ""her extraordinary commitment to veterans with disabilities"".[17]
On September 17, 2008, Duckworth attended a campaign event for Dan Seals, the Democratic candidate for Illinois's 10th congressional district. Duckworth used vacation time to avoid any appearance of impropriety, but violated Illinois law by going to the event in a state-owned van which was equipped for a person with physical disabilities. She promptly acknowledged the mistake and repaid the state for the use of the van.[18][19]
On February 3, 2009, Duckworth was nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.[20] The United States Senate confirmed her for the position on April 22.[21] On June 30, 2011, Duckworth resigned from her position to launch her campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois' 8th Congressional District.[citation needed]
Former Republican Presidential candidate and Senator Bob Dole dedicated his biography One Soldier's Story in part to Duckworth.[22] Duckworth credits Dole for inspiring her to pursue public service while she recuperated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center although, in 2006, Dole endorsed Duckworth's Republican opponent, Peter Roskam.[23]
In 2007, Duckworth was honored by the non-profit group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America with the ""Veterans Leadership Award"", in recognition of her dedication to the nation's newest generation of veterans.[24] In May 2010, Duckworth was awarded an honorary doctorate by Northern Illinois University.[25]
Duckworth was a speaker on the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention,[26] and on the first night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[27][28]
On June 26, 2013, during a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Duckworth received national media attention after questioning Strong Castle CEO Braulio Castillo on a $500 million government contract the company had been awarded based on Castillo's disabled veteran status.[29][29][30][31][32]
After long-time incumbent Republican Henry Hyde announced his retirement from Congress, several candidates began campaigning for the office. Duckworth won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 44%, defeating 2004 nominee Christine Cegelis with 40%, and Wheaton College professor Lindy Scott with 16%. In the Republican primary, Illinois Senator Peter Roskam ran unopposed. While she raised over $1 million more than Roskam, on November 7 Duckworth lost by only 4,810 votes, with 49% to Roskam's 51%.[33]
In July 2011, Duckworth launched her campaign to run in 2012 for Illinois's 8th congressional district. Duckworth defeated former Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi for the Democratic nomination on March 20, 2012, then faced incumbent Republican Joe Walsh in the general election.[34] Duckworth received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald.[35][36] Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying ""my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, the men and women who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about,"" and faced significant backlash for the comments.[37][38]
On November 6, 2012, Duckworth defeated Walsh 55%45%.[39] She is the first disabled woman to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.[40]

She released the news via a tweet of her check.[43] She joined President Barack Obama, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter.
At the AmVets' National Symposium for the Needs of Young Veterans in 2012, Duckworth called for improvements in veterans health care. She called for mandatory funding of veterans' health care, rather than discretionary funding that could change with political winds; she also wants improvements in transition assistance for those returning to civilian life, particularly for those with disabilities. Duckworth also wanted the Department of Veterans Affairs to hire more veterans as doctors and nurses because they understand what combat veterans face, and she wants the VA to prepare for the possibility of severe respiratory problems in the future for Iraq war veterans.[44]
According to The Washington Post, Duckworth believes that abortion and end-of-life decisions are private matters and should not be subject to federal restriction.[45] During her 2006 campaign for U.S. Congress, Duckworth was endorsed by EMILY's List.[46]
On August 23, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the Illinois Education Association and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. In accepting the endorsements, Duckworth criticized the Bush administration's education policy of No Child Left Behind Act.[47]
Duckworth was critical of the administration of President George W. Bush for its provision of veterans' care, and was chosen by the Democratic Party to give the September 30, 2006, response to President Bush's weekly radio address.[48][49] Her strategic recommendations included requesting an immediate accounting by the U.S. Secretary of Defense of the readiness level and the training of the Iraqi forces, followed by aggressive benchmarks for progress and redeployment of U.S. troops linked to the stand-up of Iraqi troops, saying the U.S. should proceed by standing-down a defined number of U.S. units for every Iraqi battalion that can be properly trained and certified as combat-ready.[50]
In 2006, The Sunday Times reported that Duckworth agreed with General Sir Richard Dannatt, the British Army chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict:
""We're attracting more people to terrorism than ever before. We really need to think about drawing down,"" she told The Sunday Times. ""I want the Secretary of Defense to come before Congress and tell us how many Iraqis are fully trained. If two guys can do traffic control in Kirkuk, I want to bring two Americans home.""[51]
When asked whether she would like to see Bush impeached, Duckworth said that Congress had ""far more pressing issues to deal with.""[citation needed]
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001. She said, ""Real and meaningful oversight has taken a back seat to partisan inaction. With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts.""[52]
On October 10, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The endorsement was announced in a joint appearance with the Fraternal Order of Police, who had also endorsed Duckworth. At the press conference in Lombard, Illinois, Duckworth referred to the recent school shootings and criticized her opponent's opposition to renewing a Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms, which expired in 2004. Duckworth claimed, ""Basically, whatever the NRA wants, Peter Roskam will vote for it."" She supported the Brady Law, which requires background checks for gun purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers.[53][54]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party.
The district includes many of Chicago's northern suburbs, including Arlington Heights, Des Plaines, Evanston, Glenview, Niles, Park Ridge, Rosemont, Skokie, Wilmette, and Winnetka. It also includes a large portion of Chicago's North Side bordering Lake Michigan.


Schakowsky was born Janice Danoff in 1944, in the city of Chicago, the daughter of Tillie (ne Cosnow) and Irwin Danoff.[1] Her parents were Jewish immigrants, her father from Lithuania and her mother from Russia.[1][2] She graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.S. in elementary education where she was a member of Delta Phi Epsilon (social) sorority.[3] She was Program Director of Illinois Public Action, Illinois' largest public interest group, from 1976 to 1985. She then moved to the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens as executive director for five years until 1990, when she was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, and subsequently the United States House of Representatives in 1999. She has served there for five terms.
Schakowsky is by some accounts the most[4] Progressive member of the current US Congress. She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She frequently gains ratings of between 90 and 100 from liberal and progressive interest groups and lower ratings from conservative groups.
In April 2009 Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day Tea Party protests, asserting that they were ""an effort to mislead the public about the Obama economic plan that cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and creates 3.5 million jobs."" Schakowsky added, ""It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt.""[5]
In Feb 2013, Schakowsky indicated her support for banning assault weapons as only a beginning step towards more gun control measures including a ban on handguns.[6]
As co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, Schakowsky has been known for her support of women's issues while in Congress.[7]
The Nation endorsed her for vice president in the United States presidential election, 2004, stating that she is 'the truest heir to Paul Wellstone in the current Congress'.[8] She was, however, not selected as John Kerry's running mate.
In response to concerns about electoral irregularities in the state of Ohio during the 2004 presidential election, Schakowsky was one of 31 members of the United States House of Representatives who voted not to accept Ohio's electoral votes.[9]
Schakowsky has been outspoken in her opposition to the Iraq War. She was one of the earliest and most emphatic supporters of U.S. Senator Barack Obama prior to his victory in the 2004 Illinois Democratic primary election, and actively supported his bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.[10]
In hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Subcomittee in July 2006, Schakowsky expressed concern that a report from the National Academy of Sciences showing discrepancies among scientists studying global warming might be ""used in a way to discredit the whole notion that our country and the rest of the industrialized and developing world ought to do anything about global warming"".[11]
Schakowsky indicated interest in replacing Barack Obama in the United States Senate.[12] Before his arrest, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich had reportedly been considering Schakowsky among at least six candidates to fill the vacancy. Schakowsky was one of the first figures in Illinois to voice interest in running in a special election to replace Obama.[13]
In April 2009, she stated her support for a public option in health insurance, arguing that it would put health insurance companies out of business and lead to single-payer health care, which she supports.[14]
In March 2010 Schakowsky was appointed by Speaker Pelosi to President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, commonly known as the deficit commission.[15]
In June 2011, Jan Schakowsky condemned the Progressive Democrats of America for their role in the upcoming Gaza Flotilla 2,[16][citation needed] which according to the Progressive Democrats of America website shows support of the Gaza Flotilla.[17][citation needed]
In August 2013 Schakowsky expressed support for increasing wages for fast food employees stating that increased wages would lead to ""millions of new jobs"" because of their increased spending ability.[citation needed]
In February 2014, Schakowsky (along with 17 other House members) signed a letter addressed to President Obama supporting the removal of marijuana from the DEA Controlled Substances Schedule.[18]
In March 2014, Schakowsky (along with 26 other House members) signed a letter addressed to Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to reject the Keystone XL pipeline application, arguing that it would lead to disastrous climate change.[19]
In March 2015, she planned to boycott the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to congress. She said she above all opposed the speech, because it could scuttle delicate negotiations with Iran, writing: ""The prime minister wants the negotiations to end, and his purpose in speaking to the Congress is to convince us that the president is about to agree to a deal that threatens Israel's existence. He believes the president is nave in thinking that he and the P5+1 can achieve any agreement that will stop Iran from rushing toward a bomb... What is the alternative to an agreement? Yes, the United States will increase sanctions. But does anyone doubt that Iran will build a nuclear weapon regardless of sanctions? Then the choices will be ugly: accepting a nuclear-weaponized Iran or accepting military action (i.e., war with Iran). For me it's obvious that we must give the negotiations a chance. And, in the meantime, Iran has essentially halted its weapons program under the Joint Plan of Action while the talks are ongoing.[20]
Caroline Glick of the Jerusalem Post, criticized Schakowsky's boycott of the Israeli Prime Minister, writing: ""Radical leftist representatives who happen to be Jewish, like Jan Schakowsky of suburban Chicago and Steve Cohen of Memphis, are joining Netanyahus boycotters in order to give the patina of Jewish legitimacy to an administration whose central foreign policy threatens the viability of the Jewish state.""[21]
Sidney Yates, who had represented the 9th District since 1949 (except for an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1962), had announced in 1996 that he wouldn't run for re-election in 1998. Schakowsky easily won the Democratic primary, which all but assured her of election in the heavily Democratic 9th. She won in November with 75 percent of the vote and has easily won reelection four times with 70 percent or more of the vote. She is only the third person to represent the district since 1949.
On March 11, 2004, Schakowsky's husband, lobbyist Robert Creamer, the executive director of the Illinois Public Action Fund, was indicted in federal court on 16 counts of bank fraud involving three alleged check-kiting schemes in the mid-1990s, leading several banks to experience shortfalls of at least $2.3million.[23] In August 2005, Creamer pleaded guilty to one count of failure to collect withholding tax, and bank fraud for writing checks with insufficient funds. All of the money was repaid. Schakowsky was not accused of any wrongdoing.[24] Schakowsky served on the organization's board during the time the crimes occurred,[25] and Schakowsky signed the IRS filings along with her husband.[26] U.S. District Judge James B. Moran noted no one suffered ""out of pocket losses,"" and Creamer acted not out of greed but in an effort to keep his community action group going without cutting programs, though Creamer paid his own $100,000 salary with fraudulently obtained funds.[27] On April 5, 2006, Creamer was sentenced to five months in prison and 11 months of house arrest.[28] Creamer served his five-month incarceration at the Federal Correction Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana and was released on November 3, 2006.[29]"

He previously served from 2011 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party.[2] Prior to his election, Dold ran his family-owned business, Rose Pest Solutions.[3] In 2010, Dold defeated Democratic Party nominee Dan Seals to replace Republican incumbent Mark Kirk in the U.S. House of Representatives. Dold was narrowly defeated by Democrat Brad Schneider in 2012, but regained the seat in 2014, defeating Schneider in a rematch.


Dold was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Judith Gail (ne Kelley) and Robert James Dold. His ancestry includes German, Swedish, Irish, Scottish, and English.[4] He graduated from New Trier High School where he was quarterback of the football team and captain of the wrestling and lacrosse teams.[5] He earned a BA from Denison University where he served as President of the Campus Governance Association, a law degree from Indiana University where he was selected by his classmates to give the commencement address, and an MBA from Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management.[6]
Dold was an intern in the administration of Vice President Dan Quayle.[7] He also clerked for a New York State Judge and served as an investigative counsel for the Republican-led House Government Reform and Oversight Committee.[8]
In his first radio ad of the general election campaign, Dold described himself as a small business owner, fiscal conservative and social moderate.[9] Democratic opponent Dan Seals' campaign disputed Dold's credentials as a ""social moderate"" because of presumed endorsements from conservative groups that the Daily Herald pointed out Dold hadnt actually received.[10] Dold was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune,[11] the US Chamber of Commerce[12] and the Electrical Contractors' Association.[13] Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani[12] and president of Americans for Tax Reform Grover Norquist[14] campaigned for Dold. After reporting nearly equal fund-raising for the second quarter,[15] Dold's fund-raising outpaced Seals' in the third quarter. Dold began the final quarter with more cash on hand than Seals.[16] At the request of the Federal Election Commission the Dold campaign amended their second quarter, 2010, filing in September, 2010 to reflect debts and expenditures that had been incurred in the second quarter but had not yet been billed when the filing period ended.[17]
On October 7, 2010, the Chicago Tribune endorsed Dold because he will be in the moderate, pro-choice, independent mold of Kirk.[18]
The National Journal's Cook Political Report named Dold one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012[19] with the 10th becoming more Democratic following redistricting. The endorsement of Mark Kirk, who is popular in the district, was expected to help Dold.[20] Dold had a strong cash-on-hand advantage over his opponent Brad Schneider.[21][22] Dold earned the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune and Daily Herald.[23][24] Schneider defeated Dold 51%-49%, a difference of just 3,000 votes.[25]
On May 8, 2013, Dold announced in an e-mail to supporters that he would run for his old seat in 2014.[26] He was actively recruited to run again.[27] The race has been ranked the #7 most likely flip for 2014 House rematches.[28] Dold won the rematch and took office at the start of the 114th Congress.
Dold is a moderate Republican who had a centrist voting record in Congress.[29][30][31] The non-partisan organization GovTrack has ranked Dold in the political center of Congress.[32] National Journal did a comprehensive study of key votes in the House, ranking Dold as one of the most independent members of Congress.[33] Dold is an original member of the No Labels movement which, Dold stated, he hoped would help to end the gridlock in Washington, DC.[34] While in Congress, Dold was a member of the Tuesday Group.[35] An editorial in The Daily Herald noted Dolds spirit of bipartisanship and called for more Bob Dolds in Congress.[36]
Dold supports abortion rights.[37] In 2012, Dold introduced H.R. 5650, the Protecting Womens Access to Health Care Act, which prevents lawmakers from blocking funds to Planned Parenthood.[38] He has voiced support for stem cell research.[39]In January 22 2015, Dold voted for H.R. 7 No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act which would permanently ban tax payer funding for abortion services and eliminate tax credits for private companies who provide their employees abortion services, in their insurance plans.[40]
Dold voted for the fiscal cliff compromise bill, which permanently extended most of the Bush middle class tax cuts.[41]
He has stated his support for gay marriage and immigration reform.[42] Regarding the Affordable Care Act, he has stated his desire to improve the law rather than fight to repeal or defund it.[42] Dold has said the Affordable Care Act was right to require insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions and to allow students to stay on a parent's insurance to age 26.[43] Upon his return to the House in 2015, Dold became one of just three Republican Congressmen to vote against repeal of the Affordable Care Act - the first time any elected Republicans at the federal level voted against such a measure.[44]
Dold supports gun control measures.[45] He accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and believes steps should be taken to address the issue.[46][47]
Upon taking office in 2011, Dold hired former lobbyist Eric Burgeson, who grew up in Illinois 10th district, as his congressional Chief of Staff.[48] Burgeson and Dold had previously worked together on Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign.[49] Dold instituted a policy that ""staff may not work on matters of substance with former clients.""[48]
Dold is married and has three children.[51] Dold resides in Kenilworth, Illinois and runs Rose Pest Solutions, the oldest pest control company in the country.[52][53] Dold attends Kenilworth Union Church and is a scoutmaster for Kenilworth Boy Scout Troop #13.[54]
In 2012, Dold purchased a home in Kenilworth, Illinois from his parents.[55] Because of ongoing changes to the election map due to redistricting, this home is now outside the 10th Congressional District. A campaign spokesperson said When he wins he will move into the new 10th.""[56]"

Harvard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Foster_(politician)","Bill Foster","Democratic","U.S. House","Unspecified","George William ""Bill"" Foster (born October 7, 1955) is an American physicist, businessman and U.S. Representative for Illinois's 11th congressional district, winning the seat in 2012.[2] He was previously the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 14th congressional district from 2008 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Foster was born in 1955 in Madison, Wisconsin. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of WisconsinMadison in 1976 and his Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1983. The title of his doctoral dissertation is ""An experimental limit on proton decay: "" and is available from University Microfilms International as document number 8402995.
At age 19, Foster and his younger brother Fred started a business in their basement with $500 from their parents. The company, Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC), now has over 650 employees worldwide and manufactures over half of the theater lighting equipment in the United States. Installations include Broadway shows, Rolling Stones tours, opera houses, Super Bowl halftime shows, and at schools, churches, and community centers around the world.[3]
After completing his Ph.D., Foster moved to the Fox Valley with his family to pursue a career in high-energy (particle) physics at Fermilab, a Department of Energy National Laboratory. During Foster's 22 years at Fermilab he participated in several projects, including the design of equipment and data analysis software for the CDF Detector, which were used in the discovery of the top quark, and the management of the design and construction of a 3km Anti-Proton Recycler Ring for the Main Injector.[4][5]
He has been elected a fellow of the American Physical Society, was on the team receiving the 1989 Bruno Rossi Prize for cosmic ray physics for the discovery of the neutrino burst from the supernova SN 1987A, received the Particle Accelerator Technology Prize from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and was awarded an Energy Conservation award from the United States Department of Energy for his invention and application of permanent magnets for Fermilab's accelerators.[6]
On November 26, 2007, former House Republican Speaker J. Dennis Hastert resigned as the Representative from Illinois' 14th congressional district. Foster announced his candidacy to fill the vacancy on May 30, 2007.[7] In the March special election, Foster defeated Republican nominee and Hastert-endorsed candidate Jim Oberweis 53%-47%.[8][9]
In November, Oberweis ran against Foster again in a rematch. Foster won re-election to a full term 58%-42%.[10]

In May 2011, Foster announced plans to run for Congress in the 11th District, which encompasses Aurora, Joliet, Lisle and Naperville. It also includes roughly a quarter of his old district.[16][17] The district had previously been the 13th, represented by seven-term Republican Judy Biggert. Although Biggert's home in Hinsdale had been shifted to the Chicago-based 5th District, Biggert opted to seek election in the 11th, which contained half of her old territory.[18]
On November 6, 2012, Foster won the election for the 11th district with 58% of the vote; Biggert conceded the race at 9:45pm.[19]
Foster ran again and was unopposed in the Democratic primary in March of 2014.[20] For the general election, he faced Republican nominee, State Representative Darlene Senger, and defeated her with 53.5% of the vote to her 46.5% of the vote.[21]
Although it was initially thought that Foster would not be sworn in until April due to the need to count absentee ballots before the first election would be certified, he took the oath of office on March 11.[22]
Foster joined Vern Ehlers (R-MI) and Rush Holt, Jr. (D-NJ) as the only research physicists ever to be elected to Congress.[23] On his first day in office, he cast the deciding vote to keep from tabling an ethics bill that would create an independent outside panel to investigate ethics complaints against House members.[24][25]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Bill Foster received $637,050 from labor related political action committees during his runs for Congress. $180,000 of this money came from PACs linked to public sector unions. $110,000 of these donations came from PACs linked to industrial labor unions.
According to the Federal Election Commission, Nancy Pelosi gave $4,000 to Bill Fosters 2012 campaign committee. PACs under the control of Pelosi have donated $10,000 to his 2012 campaign.
Foster supports allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. During a debate with his opponent in the 2012 election Foster said, The tax cuts were promised to generate job growth, but did not. If you follow the money, when you give a dollar to a very wealthy person, they wont typically put it back into the local economy. He said the tax benefits ended up in overseas accounts and spent on luxury purchases.[26]
Bill Foster has opposed efforts to repeal the estate tax. On 31 August 2005, U.S. Newswire reported that Foster said, ""The proponents of estate tax repeal are fond of calling it the death tax. Its not a death tax, its a Rich Kids tax."" In 2009, just before the estate tax was scheduled for a one-year repeal, Foster voted to permanently extend the then current estate tax rate of 45%.
According to the official Thomas website, Bill Foster co-sponsored the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009. On 25 February 2012, the Daily Herald reported, Foster pointed to his support for the Employee Free Choice Act while serving at the congressman in the 14th District as proof of his union support.""

He is a member of the Republican Party. Previously, he was member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 115th district from 1995 to 2015.


Bost graduated from Murphysboro High School[3] and attended the University of Illinois Certified Firefighter II Academy, later becoming a firefighter. Bost served in the United States Marine Corps from 1979 to 1982.[4]
Bost ran his family's Murphysboro-based trucking business for ten years. Since 1989, Bost and his wife Tracy have owned and operated White House Beauty Salon in Murphysboro.[5]
Bost was first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in November 1994, having lost his first campaign in 1992. In his 1994 campaign against incumbent Gerald Hawkins, he was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune.[1]
In May 2012, members of the Illinois House were given just twenty minutes to review and vote on a two-hundred page pension overhaul bill. Displeased with the situation, Bost ranted on the House floor.[6][7] Bost's rant earned him the runner-up spot on CNNs list of Best Celebrity Flip-Outs of All-Time.""[8] Bost joked about his inclusion on the list, saying ""I thought I was going to be No. 1.""[9]
In November 2013, Bost presented fellow U.S. Marine Archibald Mosley with Illinois House Resolution 706 for his lifetime accomplishments, including being among the first African-Americans to serve in the U.S. Marines. The presentation was part of a NAACP program.[10][11]
After the 2014 elections, Bost resigned early from the House so he could take office in Congress.[12] His successor, Terri Bryant, was sworn in early to fill the vacancy created by his resignation.[13]
As of 2014, Bost serves on the following state legislative committees:[14]
Bost ran for U.S. Congress in Illinois's 12th congressional district. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary, and he faced incumbent Democratic Representative William Enyart in the general election.[15] Illinois' largely agricultural 12th district leans Democratic, although it is home to many undecided voters, and Enyart was considered vulnerable in the 2014 race.[9] The Cook Political Report rated this race as ""Toss Up""[16] and the National Journal believed this district was the 21st most likely to flip Republican in 2014.[9]
In a 2014 radio interview, Bost asserted that he did not believe in climate change.[17]
Bost said he ran because ""the federal government has basically blown everything they are doing right now."" He says he intends to fight for job growth and immigration reform.[18] Bost challenged opponent Enyart to as many as a dozen debates, though Enyart has thus far replied vaguely to forums.[19]
Bost was endorsed by the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.[20]
Bost won the election, taking 52 percent of the vote to Enyart's 41 percent. When he takes office at the start of the 114th Congress, he will be the first Republican to represent this district since 1945, and only the fourth person to represent the district since 1933.[citation needed]
Bost officially began his term on January 3, 2015, and was sworn in of January 6, along with the rest of the Congressional freshmen, succeeding William Enyart.
Bost and his wife Tracy have three children and nine grandchildren.[5]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. Davis successfully ran for re-election in 2014.


Davis was born in Des Moines and is a lifelong resident of Taylorville, Illinois where he attended public school. Before attending college, he worked at a McDonald's that his parents operated.[3] He graduated with honors from Millikin University in 1992 with a degree in political science.
After graduating from college, Davis worked for then-Secretary of State George Ryan. In 1996, he lost a race for the state legislature. In 1998, Davis managed the first re-election campaign for Illinois Congressman John Shimkus. Following the successful campaign, Davis accepted a position on Shimkus' congressional staff. In 2000, Davis lost his second campaign, this time for mayor of his hometown, Taylorville. Davis served as Shimkus' Projects Director while simultaneously running for Congress.[4]
On May 19, 2012, the Republican County Chairmen for the 14 Illinois counties comprising the 13th district nominated Davis to replace Illinois Representative Tim Johnson, who had announced in April that he would not seek re-election. In addition to Davis, other finalists for the nomination were Jerry Clarke, chief of staff to fellow U.S. Representative Randy Hultgren and Johnson's former chief of staff; Erika Harold, a lawyer and winner of Miss America in 2003; and Kathy Wassink, a businesswoman.[4] Davis was reportedly coaching his sons' little league baseball game when he was informed that he had been nominated.[5]
Davis narrowly defeated David M. Gill in the general election by a margin of 1,002 votes (0.3%).[6]
On June 13, 2013, former Miss America Erika Harold announced she would run against Davis in the 2014 Republican primary.[7] The primary took place on March 18, 2014. The Republican field included Davis, Harold, and Michael Firsching.[8] Davis won the primary with 55% of the vote.[8]
Davis went on to face Democrat Ann Callis in the general election on November 4, 2014.[9] He was a top target for the Democratic Party.[10] Despite this, David ended up winning the general election with 59% of the vote.[11][12]
Davis introduced the Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 into the House on November 13, 2013. The bill would allow employers to exclude veterans receiving health insurance from the United States Department of Defense or the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs from their list of employees.[13][14] This would have the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.[14][15] Davis said that the bill ""gives our small businesses another incentive to hire veterans, which helps to address the increasing number of unemployed veterans, while providing them with some relief from ObamaCare.""[15]
Davis voted for H.J.Res.59 - Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which resulted in the Government Shutdown of 2013. After the vote, Politico reported that Davis also intended to vote for a bill that would end the shutdown, stressing that an agreement needed to be made and that ""Like most of those I represent, I remain opposed to Obamacare, but a government shutdown is absolutely unacceptable.""[16][17][18][19][20]
Davis voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act,[21] and voted to re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act.[22]
Davis considers himself pro-life, opposes public abortion funding, and is against religious institutions being required to offer health plans that include coverage for birth control.[23]
Davis supported the March 2013 budget that was proposed by Paul Ryan.[24]
Davis cosponsored the REINS Act (H.R. 367), a piece of legislation that would hold executive agencies responsible for costly regulations.[citation needed]
Davis is a proponent of building the Keystone XL Pipeline and increasing the production of coal and other natural resources.[25]
Davis supports the re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and No Child Left Behind (NCLB).[26]
Davis married his high school sweetheart, Shannon, in 1995, and the couple currently lives in Taylorville, Illinois.[27] They have three children.[4] Davis also holds various positions throughout his community. Davis serves on the Board of Education for St. Mary's Church, where he also serves as Athletic Director.[28] He coaches Taylorville Junior Football, is a member of the Taylorville Optimist Club, and serves on the Board of Directors for the Christian County Senior Center.[2]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.
Hultgren previously represented the 48th district Senate seat in the Illinois General Assembly from 2007 to 2011. The 48th Senate District includes parts of DuPage, Kane, and Will counties and all or part of Aurora, Batavia, Geneva, Naperville, North Aurora, Warrenville, West Chicago, Wheaton, and Winfield.


Hultgren graduated from Wheaton Academy in 1984 and from Bethel University in 1988, Magna Cum Laude. He earned a juris doctor from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 1993.
Hultgren has been Republican Precinct Committeeman for Milton Township Princinct #20; Member of DuPage County Board; Board of Directors for the DuPage Homeownership Center. He was first elected to the DuPage County Board in 1994, to represent the 4th district.
In 1998, incumbent Republican State Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois' 40th House District decided to retire in order to run for Congress. Hultgren ran and won unopposed.[2] He won re-election to a second term unopposed in 2000.[3] After redistricting, Hultgren decided to run in the newly redrawn 95th House District and defeated Democrat Dirk Enger 61%-37%.[4]
He was on the Death Penalty Committee[5] and the Education Committee.[6]
In 2006, incumbent State Senator Peter Roskam of Illinois' 48th Senate District decided to retire to run for Congress again. Hultgren ran and won the Republican primary 60%-40% over Naperville City Councilman Dick Furstenau.[7] He won the general election unopposed.[8] In 2008, he won re-election to a second term unopposed.[9]
On September 28, 2009, Hultgren announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Illinois's 14th congressional district and won the party's nomination in the February 2nd primary election.
Hultgren defeated Democratic incumbent Bill Foster 51%-45%.[10][11]
As a result of the decennial reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Illinois lost one seat in the US House of Representatives. The new district map (now featuring only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled Illinois General Assembly), included areas previously represented in the 8th district in the new 14th district. The 8th district was represented by Joe Walsh, but as Walsh lives in the new 14th district, he considered challenging Hultgren in the primary. Hultgren announced his intention to run for re-election, while Walsh decided to run in the 8th district.[12]
In the general election, Hultgren won re-election to a second term, beating Democratic candidate Dennis Anderson, with 59% of the vote.[13]
Hultgren ran for a third term and was opposed by Dennis Anderson for a second time. Hultgren again defeated Anderson, this time with 65% of the vote.[14][15]
Hultgren introduced the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act (H.R. 992; 113th Congress) into the House on March 6, 2013. The bill would improve the ability of banks to use swaps as a tool for hedging risk by amending the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[16][17]
Hultgren supported the Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 (H.R. 3474; 113th Congress), a bill that would allow employers to exclude veterans receiving health insurance from the United States Department of Defense or the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs from their list of employees.[18][19] This would have the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.[19][20] Hultgren wrote in favor of the bill saying that the employer health insurance mandate ""is just another costly burden that discourages employers from expanding their workforce, and our economy cannot afford it. Lifting this burden on small businesses is a win for our veterans and our economy.""[19]
In 2010 Hultgren signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[21]
During his first term in Congress, Hultgren became known as an ""outspoken advocate for basic scientific research and STEM education""[22] having been the first freshman House member of either party to win one of the major science awards for Members of Congress, with NBC Chicago noting ""The conservative Republican has carved a reputation as a pro-science, pro-STEM education supporter"".[23]
Hultgren went on record to note that ""The U.S. research system is unique. Weve found an incredibly powerful combination, wedding education and research by incorporating universities, user facilities and Department of Energy resources. But this system is only as stable our commitment to it, which is why sustained and predictable research funding is crucial."" [24]
Along with Democratic Senator Mark Udall, Hultgren was awarded the George Brown Science Technology Engineering Leadership award by the Science, Technology, Engineering Working Group,[22] a coalition of pro-science groups including The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of Physics, ASME, et al.[25]
In October 2012, Hultgren was a recipient of the Champion of Science Award by the Science Coalition, a non-profit advocacy group composed of the 50 leading research universities in the United States.[26][27] The award was presented by Fermilab Director Pier Oddone and University of Illinois President Robert Easter along with University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer, who noted that ""Congressman Hultgren provides a strong voice for science in Congress."" [26]
Hultgren introduced the American Super Computing Leadership Act (H.R. 2495; 113th Congress) into the House on June 25, 2013.[28] The bill would require the United States Department of Energy to improve and increase its use of high-end computers, especially exascale computing, through an organized research program.[29][30]
Hultgren currently resides in Winfield Township in DuPage County with his wife and four children who have been home-schooled."

Southern Illinois University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shimkus","John Shimkus","Republican","Madison County, Illinois Treasurer","Lutheran - LCMS","John Mondy Shimkus (born February 21, 1958) is the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 15th congressional district, since 1997. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district was numbered as the 20th from 1997 to 2003 and the 19th from 2003 to 2013.
The district includes much of the southern portion of the state, including a portion of the Metro-East, which is the Illinois side of the St. Louis area.


Shimkus is a lifelong resident of Collinsville, a suburb of St. Louis. He is the son of Kathleen N. (ne Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of Lithuanian descent.[1] While in the Army, he earned the Expert Infantry Badge, Ranger tab, and Parachutist Badge as well as served overseas with the 54th Infantry Regiment in West Germany.[2]
He first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a Collinsville Township trustee. A year later, he was elected as Madison County treasurer--the first Republican elected to a countywide post in 10 years. In 1994, he became the first Republican to be reelected as county treasurer in 60 years.
Shimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: ""When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.""[3]
Shimkus rejects the human-induced theory of climate change and opposes emissions trading legislation. On March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, during a United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of carbon dioxide in global warming:
""It's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.""[4]
Shimkus quoted the Bible in attempting to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood.[5] He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever.[6]
Shimkus said ""that in late-2005 he learned--through information passed along by Alexander's office--about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after Hurricane Katrina and requested a photograph.""[7]
In May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the Keystone pipeline. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian crude oil through the Midwestthrough Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.[8]
In 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination in what was then the 20th District. He was defeated by 10-year Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin.
Four years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the United States Senate. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced State Representative Jay C. Hoffman in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.
He has only faced one credible opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative David D. Phelps. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60 percent of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families.[9] Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was easily reelected.
He announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge[10] when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.
FEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in 2005. The fund also made contributions to Peter Roskam, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to David McSweeney, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006.[11][12][13] Recently the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he didn't want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.[14]
The 20th district was disbanded after the 2000 census, which is why Shimkus faced David D. Phelps, incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the 2010 census, so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district.
Shimkus has been married to the former Karen Muth since 1987. They have three children: David, Joshua, and Daniel. They are members of Holy Cross Lutheran Church (LCMS) in Collinsville.[18]"

Kinzinger was born in 1978 in Kankakee, but he was raised in Bloomington, Illinois. He graduated from Normal Community West High School in 1996 and earned a bachelor's degree from Illinois State University in 2000. He served[when?] as an intern for former U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald as part of a program offered at Illinois State.[citation needed]
In 2003, Kinzinger joined the United States Air Force. He was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in November 2003 and later awarded his pilot wings. Kinzinger was initially a KC-135 Stratotanker pilot and flew missions in South America, Guam, Iraq and Afghanistan. He later switched to flying the RC-26 surveillance aircraft and was stationed in Iraq twice.[4] Kinzinger has served in the Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, and Air National Guard and was progressively promoted to his current rank of Major.[5]
Kinzinger served as a County Board member in McLean County, Illinois from 1998 to 2003. Kinzinger defeated an incumbent County Board member in 1998 while still a student at Illinois State. Kinzinger served in that role until 2003, when he decided to serve full-time in the U.S. Air Force.[6]
In January 2009, Kinzinger met with Republican U.S. Congressmen Mike Pence, Mark Kirk, and Peter Roskam to discuss a possible run for Congress.[7] Kinzinger decided to run in Illinois' 11th congressional district, held by Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Debbie Halvorson. He started campaigning full-time in May 2009, when he returned home from his 3rd tour in Iraq. In the early autumn, Kinzinger held eight town halls across the 11th Congressional District that were attended by nearly 2,000 people. He was endorsed by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. On February 2, 2010, Kinzinger won the five-candidate Republican primary with 64% of the vote.[8]
In the general election, he was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times. On November 2, 2010, Kinzinger defeated Halvorson 57%43%.[9]
After redistricting, Kinzinger decided to run in the newly redrawn Illinois' 16th congressional district. He faced fellow U.S. Congressman Don Manzullo, a 67 year old politician first elected in 1992, in the March primary. Kinzinger currently represents 31% of the district, while Manzullo has represented at least 44% of the district in the past ten years. Kinzinger defeated the longtime incumbent 56%44%.[10] In the general election, he defeated Democrat Wanda Rohl and won re-election to a second term, 62%38%.[11]

In the general election, Kinzinger faced Democratic nominee Randall Olsen, but defeated him with 71% of the vote.[15][16]
Kinzinger sponsored the Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act of 2013, H.R. 235 in the 113th Congress.[17] This legislation would make it easier for veterans with emergency medical technician training in the military to get civilian licenses to perform the same job outside of the military. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a voice vote on February 12, 2013 and was referred to the United States Senate.[18]
On June 5, 2014, Kinzinger introduced the bill To require the Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use for potable hot water (H.R. 4801; 113th Congress), which would require the United States Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the effects that thermal insulation has on both energy consumption and systems for providing potable water in federal buildings.[19][20] Kinzinger argued that ""with the federal government being the single largest consumer of energy in the country, doing our best to maximize the potential savings from improved insulation systems is a commonsense step I think everybody can agree on.""[20]
In 2010 Kinzinger signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[21]
Kinzinger is a member of both the Republican Study Committee and Republican Main Street Partnership.
In 2006, the Wisconsin Red Cross named Kinzinger ""Hero of the Year"" for wrestling a knife-wielding man to the ground and disarming him. The man had cut the throat of a woman on a street in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[22] Recalling the event in an ABC Milwaukee interview, Kinzinger stated ""The whole time it was, to me, kind of a done deal that I was going to get stabbed in the process, but I knew that this wasn't something I could wake up to ... everyday with that memory that I watched her die.""[23] The woman survived. For this act Kinzinger also received the United States Air Force Airman's Medal and the National Guard's Valley Forge Cross for Heroism."

Previously elected to the East Moline City Council in 2007, she defeated Republican incumbent Bobby Schilling in the 2012 congressional election and a subsequent 2014 rematch.[2] Assigned to the House Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, she represents a northwest Illinois constituency anchored by the Quad Cities, Peoria, and Rockford. She is considered a leading candidate to challenge Senator Mark Kirk in the forthcoming 2016 election.[3][4]


Bustos was born in Springfield, Illinois, to Gene and Ann Callahan, one of three children. Her father worked for The State Journal-Register before entering state politics; he later served as assistant press secretary to Governor Samuel Shapiro, press secretary to Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon, and chief of staff to Senator Alan Dixon.[5] Her mother worked as a teacher.[6]
She graduated from Springfield High School in 1979. Initially attending Illinois College, she received her bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1983 and her master's degree in journalism from the University of Illinois, Springfield in 1985.[7][6]
Bustos worked for seventeen years as a reporter and editor for the Quad-City Times.[6] From 2001 to 2007, she worked as senior director of corporate communications for Trinity Regional Health Systems.[8] From 2008 to 2011, she worked as vice president of corporate communications for Iowa Health System; in her last full year, she received overall compensation of $306,295.[9]

Before first being elected in 2007, Bustos served on East Moline's Citizen Advisory Committee and the East Moline Plan Commission.[citation needed] In 2009, Bustos received an Athena Business Women's Award.[14]
In February 2010, Bustos secured state and federal money to purchase a $40,000 electronic welcome sign that was placed at the border of East Moline.[15]
In August 2010, Bustos voted for water and sewer rate hikes.[16] In January 2011, Bustos expressed interest in charging residents who do not recycle extra fees to lower the city's landfill costs.[17] In April 2011, Bustos voted for a budget that raised property taxes 4.9% and raised garbage collection fees, saying, ""these decisions have been made thoughtfully and thoroughly and during the course of 17 open and public budget sessions.""[18] She supported water and sewage increases.[19]
She has been criticized for voting for a $624,000 project to improve 10th Street in East Moline, which runs adjacent to Bustos's house; the Schilling campaign dubbed it the ""Bustos Parkway"".[20] Schilling's claim was called ""reckless, irresponsible fiction"" by the editorial board of the Quad-City Times.
After being elected to a second term in May 2011, she resigned in September 2011 to focus on her run for Congress.[21]
The Bustos campaign publicly stated it received the endorsement of about two dozen unions active in the 17th Congressional district, including the Illinois AFL-CIO, AFSCME and the United Auto Workers.[23] During the primary, Bustos received the endorsement of U.S. Senator Dick Durbin.[24] Durbin asked state Senator Dave Koehler and George Gaulrapp to drop out of the race to clear the way for Bustos, who is a close family friend of Durbin.[25] Gaulrapp reported that during a meeting with Durbin about withdrawing, Durbin said that Bustos had babysat for his family and was a close friend.[25] Bustos won the Democratic primary on March 20, 2012, defeating Freeport Mayor George Gaulrapp and businessman Greg Aguilar 54%-26%-20%.[26][27][28]
In the general election, Bustos was one of 39 candidates considered to be the most viable challengers against Republican incumbents to benefit from ""Red to Blue"" program offered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.[29] Bustos was endorsed by the Quad-City Times for the general election.[30] In November, she defeated incumbent Republican Bobby Schilling 53%-47%.[31] She'd received a significant boost from redistricting, which replaced Decatur and the district's portion of Springfield with the more Democratic portions of Peoria and Rockford. She is the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Peoria since 1927, and only the second Democrat since the 1850s to represent a significant portion of Rockford.
Bustos was challenged by Schilling for re-election in 2014.[32]
In an interview with the Chicago Tribune editorial board in 2012, Bustos expressed her support for legislation which would cut congressional pay by 10 percent. When asked by a member of the editorial board if she would voluntarily give up 10 percent of her pay should the legislation fail, Bustos said that she would. During the campaign in 2014, she stated: ""When I was in Chicago, I said something that I shouldnt have said, but I never said it on the campaign trail. I never made it as a promise to the people in the 17th Congressional District.""[33][34][35][36] The Chicago Tribune endorsed Schilling for the general election.[37]
As they did previously in October 2012, Bustos and Schilling scheduled to debate at the WQAD-TV News 8 studio on October 9, 2014 at 6:30 PM central standard time, with Good Morning Quad Cities anchor Jim Mertens serving as moderator.[38]

Bustos wants to create a ""manufacturing triangle"" connecting Peoria, the Quad Cities, and Rockford anchored by Caterpillar, John Deere, and the aerospace industry, respectively. She supports putting in place job-training programs at area community colleges to better prepare workers for skilled jobs in manufacturing.[44]
Bustos strongly supports the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare). In October 2012, her congressional campaign website said, ""The new reform law is not perfect, but makes real improvements in our health care system. It lowers costs for small businesses and makes sure you have coverage that cannot be taken away. It stops insurance companies from denying coverage of preexisting conditions and allows children to stay on their parents health insurance for longer.""[45] Bustos, a Catholic, supports the law's White House mandate on contraception, despite the Catholic Church's strong opposition.[46]
Bustos opposes a full extension of the Bush tax cuts.[47]
Bustos supports a 10% pay cut for members of Congress with no further pay raises until the federal budget is balanced. She has been critical of Republicans' approach to balancing the budget and reducing taxes. Bustos favors reducing waste and fraud, ending ""tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas,"" and ending ""corporate handouts.""[48] She does not support lowering salaries or pensions for federal government employees.[49]
Bustos supports the DREAM Act.[46]
During a debate, Bustos opposed the three trade agreements approved by Congress in 2011 as ""NAFTA-style"" and said they would result in job losses for Illinois.[49]

At the age of 33, Schock is the third youngest currently serving U.S. representative, after Patrick Murphy of Florida, and Elise Stefanik of New York. Additionally, he was the first member of the U.S. Congress born in the 1980s (and thus at the time he took his seat in 2009 he was the youngest member of Congress).[1] Previously, Schock served two terms in the Illinois House of Representatives and was its youngest member.
On March 17, 2015, after controversy about his use of federal funds, Schock announced his resignation from Congress, effective March 31.


Schock was born in Morris, Minnesota,[2] the youngest of the four children[3] of Janice Marie, a homemaker, and Richard Schock, a family practice physician and former school board member.[4][5][6] During his early years, the family lived on a rural farm site where the children were given the responsibility of tending a three-acre patch of strawberries and selling the fruit.[7] When he was in fourth grade, his family moved to Peoria. In 1995, he was elected to the executive board of the Illinois Association of Junior High Student Councils.[8]
Schock began working during the fifth grade, doing database management as an independent contractor for a bookstore chain.[9] He later bought event tickets for a licensed ticket broker, using six phone lines and thirteen credit cards, and investing his earnings in the stock market.[9] When he was in the eighth grade, he began doing the accounting work for a gravel pit, a job he kept throughout his high school years.[9] Schock started his own Individual Retirement Account at age 14.[10]
Schock attended Richwoods High School.[7] By his junior year of high school, he had completed nearly all of his graduation requirements, and had few course options available because the school district had recently discontinued most of the advanced placement and other advanced courses due to budget cuts.[11][12] School district policy did not allow him to graduate early, and the board members refused his requests to change the policy.[7][11] He began attending classes at Illinois Central College in East Peoria, earning dual credits toward high school and college graduation.[12] He graduated from high school in 2000.[7]
Schock received his Bachelor of Science degree from Bradley University in 2002,[2] with a major in finance.[13] During college, he invested in real estate and ran Garage Tek, a garage organizing business.[9] Schock sold his Garage Tek franchise in 2004 before running for state representative.[14]
Schock decided to run for the local school board a few months after graduating from high school because he felt the board needed a more diverse and youthful perspective.[7][11] After he did not get on the ballot because he did not have the required number of valid signatures on his petition to run for office, he organized a successful write-in campaign, using more than 200 volunteers who visited more than 13,000 households.[11] He defeated the incumbent 60% to 40%, garnering more than 6,400 write-in votes, and becoming, at age 19, the youngest person serving on a school board in Illinois.[15][16] After two years, his fellow board members elected him vice president of the board, and one year later, they elected him school board president, making him, at 23, the youngest school board president in Illinois history.[15]
At the age of 23, Schock ran for a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives. He defeated four-term incumbent Democrat Ricca Slone, by just 235 votes out of 40,000 ballots cast, and became the youngest member of the Illinois General Assembly in state history.[3][13][15] Five months after taking the office, he resigned from the school board to focus on his job as a state legislator.[15]
When Schock ran for reelection in 2006, he defeated Democrat Bill Spears, winning 58 percent of the total vote. He received more than 40 percent of the African American vote in his district, despite his opposition to race-based affirmative action.[3]
During his four years in the state legislature, Schock served on two appropriations committees that were ""typically reserved for more senior lawmakers"", as well as the Financial Institutions, Environment & Energy and Veteran's Affairs committees.[17][18]
During his second term as state representative, Schock worked as director of development and construction for Petersen Companies of Peoria, the real estate development arm of a senior citizen health care provider. This conflict of interest was never investigated.[10]
Schock was the chief sponsor of 38 bills, of which 13 became law.[19] The bills dealt with education, child protection, prescription drug savings, veterans' assistance, road construction and high-tech identity theft.[19] Another bill, co-sponsored with Democrat Dave Koehler, expanded the taxation area for the Peoria Airport.[20]
Though the district he represented in the state legislature included a large number of voters who were union members or who were on food stamps, Schock said, ""I could vote against things like the raising minimum wage  and go back and explain to them why it didnt make sense to raise the cost of labor...and they understood it.[9]
During his time in the state legislature, Schock was involved with Youth for a Cause, Peoria Mayor's Vision 2020, the Peoria Chamber of Commerce, Heart of Illinois Kids Count, St. Jude Telethon V.I.P. and medical mission trips to Mexico and Jamaica.[17]
In his speech announcing his candidacy for Illinois's 18th congressional district, to succeed retiring incumbent Republican congressman Ray LaHood, Schock said, ""If China continues to be irresponsible about nuclear proliferation in Iran, we should tell them that ... we will sell Pershing nuclear missiles to Taiwan for their defense. Nonproliferation will either be enforced universally or not at all  it is their choice. The Chinese will come around, I have no doubt.""[21] His campaign manager described the policy as ""well thought out"" and Schock first defended the remarks, but Schock later said it was ""more in jest"" and that he had made a mistake.[22][23]
Schock easily won the Republican primary in February 2008, with 72% of the vote,[15] beating his opponents Jim McConoughey (16%) and John Morris (12%).[24]
Schock drew mixed reaction in late July 2008 when he brought President George W. Bush to Peoria to raise money for the congressional campaign. The city of Peoria provided 38 police officers, 30 city trucks for temporary security barriers, and a number of firefighters, spending $38,252 to facilitate the visit, even though it was a private, paid-admission fundraiser. When requests to compensate the city increased, Schock called it ""obviously a political move"" and compared the issue to Barack Obama's endorsement of another state senator on the courthouse steps a few years before, for which the city did not request compensation.[25] A city councilman cited an ordinance against political activity by the city, but the mayor of Peoria, Jim Ardis, called the requests ""political rhetoric"" and said the ordinance did not apply, and that the city did not have a policy addressing a situation where a sitting president visits town. Schock later said he would reimburse the city voluntarily, referring to payment for presidential protection as ""unprecedented,"" and saying he believed his campaign was the first in the state and possibly the nation to repay a city for protective services provided to a president.[26]
Schock spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention.[27]
Prior to the general election, Shock was endorsed by 116 mayors across the district and the Illinois Farm Bureau. Schock's hometown newspaper, the Journal Star, endorsed Schock ""on the basis of his potential.""[28]
In October 2008, Schock's father testified in a federal court that his son had notarized documents with false dates (a Class A misdemeaner under the Illinois Notary Public Act) while helping his parents establish tax shelters.[29]
Schock won the November 4, 2008 general election with 59% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Colleen Callahan and Green Party candidate Sheldon Schafer.[15][30] He was only the fifth person to serve the district since 1933. Upon taking his seat in Congress, at the age of 27, he became the youngest member of Congress, supplanting 33-year-old Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina,[31] and the first member of the United States Congress born in the 1980s.[32]
In the November 2008 election, Democrat Jehan A. Gordon won Schock's 92nd Representative District seat in the Illinois House of Representatives.[33]
In November 2010, Schock was challenged by Democrat D.K. Hirner, the Executive Director of the Illinois Environmental Regulatory Group and the Green Party nominee Sheldon Schafer. The Journal Star again endorsed Schock, writing, ""Schock is a more self-assured, well-rounded candidate than he was two years ago."" The endorsement noted that Schock had ""voted with President Barack Obama more than a third of the time, breaking with GOP leaders on multiple issues, from his support for renewable energy to taming predatory lenders to FDA regulation of tobacco.""[34] Schock won with 59% of the vote.
For 2012, it appeared that Schock would face Darrel Miller in the Republican primary, but Miller was removed from the ballot in February 2012 due to problems with his petition signatures.[35] In the general election, Schock faced Democrat Steve Waterworth.[36]
In April 2012, watchdog groups filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming that Schock violated federal campaign rules when he solicited a $25,000 donation from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor for use in a Republican primary. Schock's campaign stated that it believed the FEC would dismiss the complaint after review.[37] In December 2012, the House Committee on Ethics confirmed that the same matter had been referred to it by the Office of Congressional Ethics.[38] In February 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics' report was publicly released, which stated, ""there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Schock violated federal law, House rules and standards of conduct."" At the time of the release, Schock's communications director released a statement saying: ""The release by the Ethics Committee of this report from the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) is just one more step in the long process of adjudicating ethics complaints that can be submitted by anyone for any reason...We remain firmly convinced that Congressman Schock will be exonerated when the Ethics Committee examines the complaint and in due course resolves this matter.""[39]
Questions have also been raised about a real estate transaction that occurred the month before the 2012 elections. Schock sold his Peoria home to a major Republican donor, who was also one of his campaign supporters, for a price that appeared to far exceed its then market value,[40] and reported as three times its worth. This lead to another ethics complaint being filed against Schock by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.[41]
Schock was endorsed by the editorial board of The State Journal-Register, who wrote that Schock ""has grown in his two terms in the House, building expertise on budget, trade, transportation and agriculture issues and reaching across the aisle at times to build a solid record.""[42] Schock was also endorsed by the Journal Star and the Chicago Tribune.[43][44]
Schock defeated Waterworth to win reelection on November 6, 2012, winning 74 percent of the vote.[45]
After the 2012 election, there was speculation about Schock's ambitions for higher political office, including a Roll Call article noting that Schock's new district in central Illinois had been drawn, during redistricting after the 2010 census, to be very safe, leading to suggestions that Democrats were trying to keep him happy in the House and away from any statewide bid. An Illinois Republican was quoted as saying, ""I think he would be the top candidate on the Republican side if Dick Durbin retired or if he wanted to run for governor ... His ability to fundraise and be popular with conservatives without coming across as an ideologue would suit him well if he chooses to run.""[46] In November 2012, it was reported that Schock had met with officials at the Republican Governors Association to explore the possibility of running for Governor of Illinois in 2014.[47] However, in April 2013, Schock announced that he would not be running for governor, and would instead be seeking election to a fourth term in Congress.[48]
Schock won the November 2014 general election with 74.7% of the vote, defeating Democrat Darrel Miller.
Two weeks after taking office in 2009, Schock proposed an amendment, which passed, to the Troubled Asset Relief Program Accountability Act, to create a searchable website so Americans could see where bailout funds were being spent. The act's sponsor, Democrat Barney Frank, said ""this is a very thoughtful amendment and it will greatly enhance things.""[49]
In February 2009, President Barack Obama invited Schock to fly with him on Air Force One for a visit to a Caterpillar plant in East Peoria, Illinois. During the visit, Obama appealed to Schock to support the $787 billion stimulus bill which was up for a vote the next day in Congress. Obama said Schock is ""a very talented young man. Ive got great confidence in him to do the right thing for the people of Peoria."" Schock ultimately voted against the stimulus package, saying, ""it was not really a stimulus bill with the majority of the money going towards stimulating the economy. Schock also said, ""I like the President. Hes a very good guy...I want him to be successful. I want to vote for a stimulus bill. I appreciated his hospitality in bringing me along on the trip...But at the end of the day my responsibility is to the people who gave me this job  my constituents.""[50]
During his first year in Congress, Schock had more of legislation passed than any other Republican freshman. In 2010 he secured $40.7 million in funding for Illinois.[51]
On February 28, 2013, Schock reintroduced the New Philadelphia, Illinois, Study Act (H.R. 930; 113th Congress), a bill that would instruct the United States Department of the Interior to study the New Philadelphia archaeological site in Illinois to evaluate the national significance of the area and to determine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System.[52][53] Schock had previously introduced similar legislation in the 111th United States Congress (H.R. 5455).[54]
Schock and Rep. William R. Keating jointly introduced the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act (H.R. 1814; 113th Congress) on April 29, 2013.[55] The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage.[55] Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption if they went on to later use healthcare.[56] Schock and Keating wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, ""we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse.""[56]
In December 2013, Schock was selected by House Speaker John Boehner to lead the congressional delegation to the Funeral of Nelson Mandela. Schock was the only current Republican House of Representatives member in the delegation and only other seated Republican Congressman other than Texas Senator, Ted Cruz.[57]
Schock is considered to be more conservative than his two moderate[58] predecessors, Congressmen Bob Michel and Ray LaHood.[3][43][59] The Chicago Tribune, in their endorsements for the 2008 general election, described Schock's political positions to be fiscally conservative and somewhat moderate on social issues.[60] Nevertheless, he has said he would have supported the financial bailout plan, or the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, that passed Congress in October 2008[22] and he did not support the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" in 2010.[61] Schock is a former member of the Republican Study Committee[62] and a current member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. Schock has said ""our strategy with young people needs to be economic issues,"" and that social issues are ""not what compelled me to run for office.""[63]
In their 2010 endorsement of Schock, the Journal Star wrote, ""We've not always seen eye to eye with Schock, but he has been far more influential than your average freshman. He's a hard worker, a rising star in the Republican Party...We have long valued independence in our congressmen; Aaron Schock is a conservative, but he also has a mind of his own, and he is endorsed.""[34]
Schock endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries,[64] and he appeared with Romney at campaign events.[65]
Schock voted against the $787 billion stimulus plan in February 2009.[50] He also voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010.[66] He has advocated for tort reform and interstate health insurance competition as ways to reduce health care costs.[67]
Schock has introduced legislation that would create the Federal Program Sunset Commission (H.R. 606). His proposed legislation would create a bipartisan commission made up of former members of Congress and outside experts to abolish federal programs that are found to be unnecessary or under-performing.
During the debate on the short-term Continuing Resolution that passed the House on February 19, 2011, Schock was successful in banning further funding for the creation of stimulus signs that highlight stimulus-related projects around the country. In July 2010, Schocks bill was selected as a winning proposal in a public outreach effort designed by House Republicans to highlight proposals aimed at reducing government spending.[68]
In February 2011, Schock was one of 23 Republicans who voted against an amendment that proposed cutting funding to the National Endowment for the Arts.[69]
In 2011, Schock and Delaware Democrat John Carney co-sponsored a bill that would use U.S. oil exploration to help fund a five-year federal highway construction project. The bill had not been voted on as of April 2012.[70][71]
Schock has signed the Americans for Tax Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge, promising not to vote for any new taxes.[72] Schock was a supporter of free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, which passed the House in fall 2011.[46]
In September 2011, Schock and Democrat Leonard Boswell introduced the Help Veterans Own Franchises Act, which would allow tax credits for the establishment of franchises owned by veterans. As of April 2012, the bill was in committee.[73]
In 2009, Schock voted to secure $23 million for restoration and conservation of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.[74]
In April 2010, Biofuels Digest named Congressman Aaron Schock as #8 in the top ten groups of individuals that ""make it happen for renewables, bioenergy in DC.""[75] Schock, who says energy is the issue that people most want to talk about, supports eliminating federal taxes on the production of renewable energy.[76]
In March 2011, Schock signed on as an original co-sponsor to a proposal by Republican Congressman Devin Nunes of California called ""A Roadmap for America's Energy future,"" (H.R. 909) which is a comprehensive plan focusing on policies that promote the production of a broad range of domestic energy supplies including traditional resources as well as renewable and alternative energy sources.
Schock has been an opponent of using federal funds for the transfer of detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to elsewhere in the U.S.[77] In January 2011, Schock introduced legislation with Senator Mark Kirk to deny federal funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States. Similarly, he has fought to require military tribunals, as opposed to civilian courts, for detainee trials.
In August 2009, the Law Library of Congress issued a controversial and disputed[78] legal-opinion report, Honduras: Constitutional Law Issues, that had been commissioned by Schock. It featured a legal analysis of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis with a specific examination of the legality of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya's June 28, 2009, removal from office and expatriation.[79] After the report was issued, Schock argued that the Obama Administration should change its policy towards Honduras by resuming suspended aid and recognizing the upcoming Honduran November 29, 2009, elections, based on the contents of the report.[80]
After visiting the country twice, Schock created the congressional Colombia Caucus.[46]
On December 15, 2009, during a discussion on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Schock stated ""I dont believe we shouldwe should limit water-boarding or, quite frankly, any other alternative torture technique if it means saving Americans lives"" in a ""ticking time bomb"" scenario or other critical situation. He added that he didn't believe such techniques ""should be standard practice.""[81]
Schock voted against amending federal hate crimes laws to include crimes where the victims were targeted on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender and disability.[82] He voted against the repeal of the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" in December 2010.[61]
Schock also voted against the Employment Discrimination Law Amendment H.R. 11 and H.R. 12, which were eventually passed on January 9, 2009.[83]
Schock voted for House Amendment 1416, which Prohibits Use of Funds in Contravention of the Defense of Marriage Act, adopted 247 to 166 in the House July 19, 2012.[84]
Schock is pro-life and has voted to prohibit federal funding for the procedure with House Amendment 95.[85] In addition, Schock voted to pass H.R. 3 ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act"".[86]
Schock voted against the DREAM Act.[87] However, TheHill.com reported that Schock was ""slammed"" for calling illegal immigrants ""undocumented citizens"" and for showing support for a legalization program at a town hall event.[88][89]
Schock voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After this was done for the 56th time in 2015, but without any replacement for the nation's sickest in place, the Peoria Journal Star stated: ""The Affordable Care Act has its flaws, but its congressional detractors, Schock among them, have made it darn hard to conclude they are serious about governing.""[90]
Schock, along with Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), introduced a bill in 2013 known as the Higher Education and Skills Obtainment Act. The bill would narrow the eligibility for people to use certain tax credits related to higher education. To do so, the legislation would take away eligibility for those tax credits from people who aren't students or who ""did not attend an eligible institution,"" according to Ripon Advance.[91]
Schock voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.[92]
During his first term, Schock requested and was given three committee assignments.[93] In addition, he was appointed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor to be a deputy minority whip.[93][94] He served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology of the Small Business Committee. Soon after being sworn in to serve his first term, he joined the Republican Study Committee, ""a home for deficit hawks"", according to the Los Angeles Times.[93] As of April 2012, he is no longer a member of the Republican Study Committee.[62] Schock is a current member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of moderate Republicans who advocate reducing the deficit, cutting taxes, and focusing on education and environmental issues.[95]
At the beginning of his second term in 2011, Schock was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee.[94] On the committee he serves on the Subcommittee on Trade, Subcommittee on Social Security and Subcommittee on Oversight. The Subcommittee on Trade has oversight over reciprocal trade agreements including multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations and implementation of agreements involving tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. Schock also serves on the Committee on House Administration, which is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives.
Schock received an unusual amount of media coverage during his first term in Congress, much of it focusing on his physique and youthful appearance.[9][93] According to the New York Times, he has ""cultivated an image that is more about lifestyle and less about lawmaking.""[40] Schock was selected ""hottest freshman"" congressman in a February 2009 reader poll on The Huffington Post.[96] Schock has been frequently targeted by TMZ.com reporters since his arrival in Washington.[97][98] Schock told CNN's Reliable Sources that such soft media coverage could increase voters' interest in politics. ""People who watch TMZ or different mediums don't expect to see their congressman on such a show,"" he said. ""To see their hometown congressman on a show like this kind of raises their interest and gets them a little excited.""[99] In 2009, Schock appeared on The Colbert Report, during which the host, Stephen Colbert making fun of the TMZ reports ""grilled"" Schock about his ""six-pack abs"".[100] Schock went on to appear on the cover of the June 2011 issue of Men's Health, which one commentator decried as evidence of ""a narcissism that never rests"".[101] Schock appeared on Season 7 (2010) of Top Chef, a competition reality-television program, as a guest judge.[102]
In 2012, Schock told Roll Call that ""I'm a big believer if you want to change people's minds or get someone to vote for you, either a voter or a colleague, you've got to first get their attention. If people don't know who you are, they're not going to listen to your message. And not everybody pays attention to politicians by watching Fox News and CNN.""[46] In May 2013, Schock was nominated for and included in a Time magazine poll titled ""Who's the Most Influential Millennial?""[103] Despite an anti-gay voting record, during his time in office Schock was the subject of persistent gay rumors in the media, which he repeatedly addressed with vigorous denials.[104][105][106]
In February 2015, the Washington Post reported that Schock's congressional offices had been lavishly redecorated in a style inspired by the aristocratic homes in the television show Downton Abbey.[107][108] [109] In response to that story, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint alleging Schock could have received an improper gift. CREW's executive director, Anne Weismann, stated, ""Again and again, Rep. Schock's seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in [an] ethical manner.""[110] Schock dismissed the criticism with the statement ""Haters gonna hate"", which was in turn criticized for its apparent flippancy.[111][101] Schock later stated he intended to pay the decorator.[112] Another investigation had discovered he had spent campaign money on workout DVDs.[110]
Further media scrutiny of congressional expenditure reports showed that Schock had spent over $100,000 in government funds on office decorating and renovations between January 2009 and late 2014, mostly during his first term.[113] Other media reported Schock had charged thousands of dollars for private flights, legal expenses, new cars, tickets to the Super Bowl and Country Music Awards,[114] as well as cufflinks, massage, ""gold equipment"" and cigars[115] to his government-funded office account. The Associated Press accessed the location metadata on Schock's Instagram photos and correlated it with private flight records to identify flights that did not correspond to his campaign finance disclosures.[116] In response, Schock's office stated it had begun an internal review of the reimbursements.[114]
In March 2015 there were further exposures of spending and disclosure irregularities,[117][118] including that Schock had accepted money from an outside group, the Global Poverty Project, to cover the cost of bringing a photographer on an all-expenses-paid trip to India organized to discuss sanitation and access to clean water.[119][120] The Associated Press also reported that much of Schock's personal wealth had been built with the assistance of political donors.[121][122] Conservative commentators began calling for Schock's replacement.[123][124] The conservative magazine National Review called him ""a crook"" and stated: ""Politics shouldnt be a ticket to a celebrity lifestyle on the public's dime. For a man who has enjoyed such a short and undistinguished career, Illinois's Representative Aaron Schock (R.) has sure packed in a lot of corruption.""[125]`
On March 16, Politico reported that Schock had requested the federal government and his campaign reimburse him for a total of 170,000 miles that were driven on his personal car, a Chevrolet Tahoe, between January 2010 and July 2014. But when he sold that car in July 2014, records of the sale said it had only been driven 80,000 miles.[126]
On March 17, Schock announced his resignation from Congress, effective March 31.[127] By resigning, he avoided an impending congressional ethics inquiry. On March 20, the Chicago Tribune reported that federal investigators had opened a ""preliminary investigation"" into the activities ofSchock.[128]

Georgetown University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Visclosky","Pete Visclosky","Democratic","Attorney, Congressional aide","Roman Catholic","Peter John ""Pete"" Visclosky (born August 13, 1949) is the U.S. Representative for Indiana's 1st congressional district, serving since 1985. He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Dean of the Indiana congressional delegation. The District lies in Northwest Indiana. Redistricting passed by the Indiana General Assembly in 2011 changed the district's boundaries, effective January 2013, to include all of Lake and Porter counties as well as the western and northwestern townships of LaPorte County, while shifting Benton, Newton, and Jasper counties out of the district. Much of the population is based in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.


Visclosky was born in Gary, Indiana, the son of John and the late Helen (ne Kauzlaric) Visclosky. He is of Croatian-Slovak descent.[1] He was educated at Andrean High School in Merrillville, Indiana. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting at Indiana University Northwest in Gary, Indiana and went on to earn his juris doctor from Notre Dame Law School. At Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Visclosky earned a Master of Laws in International and Comparative Law. He worked as a lawyer and staff member of United States Representative Adam Benjamin before entering the House.
In 1984, Visclosky ran for Congress in Indiana's 1st congressional district. In the Democratic primary, he defeated incumbent U.S. Congresswoman Katie Hall, Jack Crawford, and Sandra Smith 34%-33%-31%-1%.[2] In the general election, he defeated Republican Joseph Grenchik 71%-29%.[3] In 1986, he won the Democratic primary again with 57%, defeating Hall and three other candidates.[4] He won the general election with 73% of the vote.[5] In 1988, he won the Democratic primary 84%-16% against Sandra Smith.[6] He went on to win the general election with 77% of the vote.[7]
In 1990, Hall challenged Visclosky for the third time and was defeated 51%-30%.[8] He won the general election with 66% of the vote.[9] In 1992, he won the Democratic primary with 72%[10] and the general election with 69%.[11] In 1994, he won the Democratic primary with 77% of the vote.[12] In the general election, he defeated Republican John Larson 56%-44%.[13]
For the rest of his career, he has never won a primary with less than 71% and he has only once won a general election with less than two-thirds of the vote - in 2010, when Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives.
Visclosky is pro-union[14] and anti-free trade.[15] Reinstating the steel tariff and fighting to save American manufacturing jobs have long been priorities of Visclosky. He served as Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus when the Democrats had control of the House, and currently serves as the Vice Chair. He is also a former Chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee and the current Ranking Member.
Visclosky is one of the 126 Democrats who voted against the Iraq War Resolution. He also is a supporter of high tech solutions as a way to revive the American blue collar work force, and as a way to decrease crime.
The Washington Times reported in March 2009 that Visclosky had received, over ten years, $1.36 million in campaign donations from clients of the PMA Group. In 2007 and 2008, the United States House Committee on Appropriations, of which Visclosky is a member, directed $137 million in government purchasing to PMA's clients. In May 2009, Visclosky received subpoenas in the grand jury investigation into PMA Group, the first member of Congress to be subpoenaed in the investigation.[16] The Congressman was later cleared of all charges by the House Ethics Committee, who detailed in a 305 page report that ""Simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor does not, on these two facts alone, support a claim that a member's actions are being influenced by campaign contributions"".[17]
In 2011, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, clearing Visclosky and Republican former Representative Todd Tiarht of Kansas. While PMAs lobbyists pushed or directed company executives to maximize personal or Political Action Committee (PAC) campaign contributions and to attend specific fundraisers while pursuing earmarks, the report notes, the evidence did not show that Members or their official staff were included in discussions or correspondence about, coordinated with PMA on, or knew of these strategies.

Visclosky is married to Joanne Royce, and has two sons, John and Tim."

Kaser 64%36%.[10] In 2006, she won a second term with 53% of the vote.[11] In 2008, she won a third term unopposed.[12]
During her tenure in the Indiana House, Walorski was a sponsor of Indiana's Voter ID law, requiring voters to present Government issued identification during in person voting.[7] The Voter ID law led to many lawsuits and was brought before the Supreme Court, where the law was upheld in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, and is cited as helping the expansion of Voter ID laws in other states.[13]
Walorski has been criticized for missing a committee vote and the opportunity for stopping the Daylight Saving Time bill from passing out of committee, even though that bill died on the House floor.[14][15] After a different bill passed introducing DST, she authored and introduced a bill to rescind DST, a measure that ended up dying.[15]
Walorski authored legislation combating identity theft, including in 2006 when she sponsored a bill requiring companies to notify customers who are Indiana residents, of any security breaches that could cause identity theft, identity deception or fraud, and making it a Class C felony and imposing a $50,000 fine on anyone who has the identities of over 100 persons.[16] With Walorski saying that ""Identity theft is the most rapidly growing crime in the United States. We need to find a solution to this problem before it gets any bigger in Indiana.""[17]
Walorski became active in the caucus and was appointed as Assistant Floor Leader. She served on the Family, Children, & Human Affairs and the Public Policy committees.[18]
On January 31, 2009, Walorski formally announced her bid to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Joe Donnelly in Indiana's 2nd congressional district.

On March 22, 2011, Walorski announced that she would run for Indiana's 2nd Congressional District again. Over the Indiana legislature's 2011-2013 legislative session, the predominately Republican Indiana House and Senate redrew Indiana's congressional districts. After redistricting, the newly drawn 2nd district included all Elkhart County, Walorski's home county, and the demographics of the new district included more registered Republican voters. [23]
Incumbent Democratic Congressman Joe Donnelly decided not to seek re-election, opting instead to run for the U.S. Senate.[24] Walorski ran against Libertarian candidate Joe Ruiz of Mishawaka[25] and Democratic candidate Brendan Mullen of Granger.[26]
On May 8, 2012, Walorski easily won the primary election with 73% of the vote, winning all 10 counties in the 2nd District.[27][28][29][30] Many articles have been written about Walorski's role as a woman running for Congress.[31]
Walorski defeated Mullen 49%-48%.[32] She took office on January 3, 2013. At the same time, Donnelly was elected to the Senate.[33]
Walorski is a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment and has advocated privatizing Social Security. In March 2010 she said, I think the one thing we have to do is the thing that Bush actually tried to do a couple years ago, which is privatize Social Security and allow people to invest in their own retirement. She has received endorsements from the National Federation of Small Business and the U.S. and Indiana chambers of commerce [34]
Walorski voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.[35]
In 2015, Walorski rejected the ""Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,"" a bill banning Late termination of pregnancy or late-term abortions, the highly controversial abortion procedure given beyond 20 weeks into a pregnancy. [36] In 2013, Walorski said she would support a ban on late-term abortions. [37]
In 1995, Walorski married her husband, Dean Swihart, a schoolteacher in Mishawaka.[18] She resides in Jimtown, an unincorporated suburban community west of Elkhart, and is a member of Hope City Church (formerly Calvary Temple and Southgate Church), an Assemblies of God megachurch in South Bend.[38]"

A Republican, Stutzman previously served as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 2002 to 2008, representing district 52, and as a member of the Indiana Senate, representing the 13th district, from 2009 to 2010.[2]
Stutzman was a candidate in the 2010 U.S. Senate election, but was defeated in the primary election in May 2010 by former Senator Dan Coats.[3]
On June 12, 2010, Stutzman won the Republican nomination for the general election and special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mark Souder, congressman for Indiana's 3rd congressional district.[4] Stutzman defeated 14 other candidates on the second ballot by winning a simple majority (229) of the 400 votes cast by precinct committee members.


Stutzman is a fourth-generation farmer who grew up on a farm located in both Saint Joseph County, Michigan and LaGrange County, Indiana. He graduated from Lake Area Christian High School located in Sturgis, Michigan in 1994. He attended Glen Oaks Community College in 1999and Tri-State University from 2005to 2007. As co-owner with his father, Albert, he runs Stutzman Farms, farming 4,000 acres (16km2) in the Michiana area. He is also owner of Stutzman Farms Trucking.[5]
First elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2002 at the age of 26, Stutzman served as the youngest member of the legislature until 2006. In 2009, he was elected to the Indiana Senate representing the 13th district. He ran for the Republican nomination for the 2010 U.S. Senate election in a bid to replace retiring incumbent Evan Bayh.
Stutzman was elected in a November 2, 2010 special election to fill the rest of resigning Representative Mark Souder's term. He was simultaneously elected to a full two year term to expire in 2013.
Stutzman consistently received 90% ratings or above from the Chamber of Commerce and other small business associations for his support of pro-business legislation. In 2008 he won the Small Business Champion Award [12] from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. He was cited as a Taxpayer Friendly State Legislators by Indiana WatchDog [13] an independent, volunteer organization.
He served as the ranking member of the Indiana State Senate Utilities and Technology Committee and helped to pass alternative energy incentive legislation in Indiana.
In 2006 he served as the chairman of the Indiana Public Policy Committee taking strong stands for conservative values on controversial issues.[citation needed]
Stutzman supported the shutdown of the U.S. government in 2013 but said he did not know what would be gained from it, saying, Were not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I dont know what that even is.[14]
Stutzman advocates for more accountability in state government operations. He co-authored a bill to establish the Hoosier Grace Commission which passed in 2003. The commission helped eliminate wasteful state government spending and has brought fraud and/or scandals to public awareness.[15]
Stutzman authored a bill that required more money to go directly to the classroom. The bill was instrumental in paying back the $600 million that was owed by state government to schools, and increased funding for students six years in a row.
In Congress, Stutzman has opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In September 2013, he advocated attaching a measure defunding the Act to must-pass legislation funding the federal government.[16]
After the government subsequently shut down, Stutzman remarked that the issue at stake was no longer merely the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Republicans would need some concession in order to reopen the government.[17]
In 2010 Stutzman signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[18]
On June 6, 2010 a Facebook message from former Rep. Mark Souder was sent to Noble County prosecutor Steven Clouse and GOP county chairman Randy Kirkpatrick regarding Stutzman's campaign finance ""problem"", Souder's affair with staffer Tracy Jackson, and predictions on the Republican's caucus to replace Souder on the November ballot.[19] The fourteen-point message was eventually forwarded on to Republican leaders, journalist, and media outlets. Souder confirmed the authenticity of the message to The Journal Gazette by email, but he declined to comment beyond saying it was intended to be a private message.[20]
In the Facebook message, Souder touts Stutzman as the favorite in the caucus but also asserts that Stutzman possibly played a role in making Souders affair public. Tracy Jackson's husband, Brad, is mentioned throughout the message as having flown Stutzman, while he was a United States Senate candidate, to numerous campaign stops throughout the state without reporting it to the FEC.
Stutzman's only response to date regarding the unreported flights by Brad Jackson was, ""He (Souder) should be focusing on his family and his marriage right now. If he had concerns about our finances  which he shouldnt  why didnt he talk to me?[20]
Stutzman ran for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by incumbent Evan Bayh. He lost to former U.S. Senator Dan Coats in the primary.
Incumbent U.S. Representative Mark Souder (R-IN) resigned after admitting to an affair. This event occurred after he won the Republican primary on May 4. On June 12, Republicans from Indiana's third district met in Columbia City to choose Souder's replacement. Stutzman won decisively on the second ballot.[21] He defeated the Democratic candidate in both the general election and the special election to fill the remainder of Souder's term (both held on the same day).
Stutzman defeated his Democratic opponent Kevin Boyd by a 67%-33% margin.[22]
Stutzman and his wife, Christy, have two sons, Payton and Preston."

Rokita, a member of the Republican Party, previously served two terms as Secretary of State of Indiana from 2002 to 2010. When Rokita was elected to office in 2002 at the age of 32, he became at the time the youngest secretary of state in the United States.


Rokita grew up in Munster, located in Lake County in Northwest Indiana. Rokita attended Munster High School.[1] He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he was an Eli Lilly Fellow. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[2] He has a law degree from Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.[3]
Rokita was a practicing attorney. In 1997 he joined the secretary of state's office as general counsel. He later became deputy secretary of state.[4]
Rokita was elected by his peers nationally to serve on the nine-member federal executive board of the Election Assistance Commission.[4] The commission is charged by law to address election reform issues on a nation-wide basis. Rokita has testified about Indiana's voting reform efforts before the United States Congress.
Rokita was a named defendant in the Hoosier State's voter identification case went before the U.S. Supreme Court on January 9, 2008; the combined cases of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board (07-21) and Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita (07-25) involved the Indiana voting requirement laws that require voters display state-issued photo IDs before voting. In April 2008, the US Supreme Court upheld that law. Rokita also served as Indiana's chief securities fraud investigator.
As secretary of state, Rokita visited each of Indiana's ninety-two counties at least once per year. Rokita was named as one of the ""40 under 40"" by the Indianapolis Business Journal.[when?] Rokita was active in the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and after serving as the elected treasurer, he became the President for the 2007-2008 term.[5]
In September 2009, Rokita outlined a plan to reform how Indiana's legislative districts are drawn to reduce gerrymandering. He proposed making it a felony for lawmakers to use political data or incumbents' addresses when drawing electoral maps. Indiana's congressional districts and districts for the Indiana Senate and Indiana House of Representatives will next be redrawn after the 2010 Census. Rokita says boundaries should follow existing county and township lines, and that each of the 50 senate districts should be divided into two house districts, claiming this will lead to more competitive legislative elections.[6]
On Aug. 4th 2014, on an Indianapolis radio program, while discussing the 2014 American immigration crisis Rokita expressed concerns about the ability of border patrol agents to properly process and screen individuals entering the country illegally. He stated that from a public-health standpoint that we need to know the condition of these kids while citing the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa as a news event that shows how rapidly diseases can spread. In response to reports stating that Rokita believed that illegal immigrants are carrying Ebola, he clarified that the sudden spread of Ebola in Africa is merely one example of how we must take deliberate care to prevent an outbreak of any type of disease inside our borders.[7] Rokita also cited news reports indicating that nationals from 75 different countries had been apprehended between 2010 and 2014 illegally crossing the MexicoUnited States border.[8]
In October 2013 during the American government shutdown, Rokita was interviewed by CNN journalist Carol Costello. Her pointed questions about Rokita's defense of the shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of government employees without compensation while he continued to receive his paycheck, were eventually countered with his statement that she was ""beautiful but you have to be honest"" and that journalists were part of the problem.[9] The Congressman's office issued a statement that he intended no offense by his comments.
In April 2007, Rokita was speaking at a Republican event, and encouraged Republicans to reach out to African-Americans. He mentioned 90 percent of African Americans vote Democratic, after which he asked, ""How can that be? Ninety to ten. Who's the master and who's the slave in that relationship? How can that be healthy?""[10][11] Four days after making those remarks, he apologized.[12] Rokita also met privately with eleven members of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus to apologize for the comment. Representative Vernon Smith, D-Gary, told reporters, He apologized to our satisfaction. We do believe he was sincere in his apology,"" Smith said. ""I think there are greater issues  education, health, economics for the black community  that are more important than us spending all this time on a slip of the lip. I do believe that we all make mistakes (and) that if we expect to be forgiven, we need to forgive."" During the course of the same private meeting Rokita was told his office should reflect the diversity of the state, at the time of his remarks 89% of the employees in Rokita's office were white. [13]
On February 1, 2010, three days after Congressman Steve Buyer of Indiana's 4th congressional district said that he would retire at the end of his term, Rokita posted an announcement on Facebook making clear his intentions to run for the open seat.[14]
Buyer's announcement touched off a free-for-all among area Republicans to succeed him. Ultimately, thirteen candidates entered the Republican primary, including Rokita. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+14, the 4th is one of the most Republican districts in the Eastern Time Zone and tied for the second-most Republican in the state (behind the 5th District). It was taken for granted that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman.
Rokita won the primary with 42 percent of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 68.6% of the vote.
Rokita is against federal government regulation over farming. A representative of a heavy-farming district in Indiana, Rokita has voted in favor of deregulating farmer restrictions, earning him an ""A"" rating from the American Farm Bureau Federation.[15] He co-sponsored the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act- passing the house in March 2011- in order to prevent the ""significant burden on small businesses for little obvious environmental benefit."" Rokita also co-sponsored the Preserving America's Family Farms Act- which passed the House in July 2012- citing Indiana's dependence on youth work on family farms.[16]
Rokita opposes any Health Care regulation that increases the national debt, earning a ""B"" rating by the National Taxpayers Union 2011 Positions on Tax and Spending.[17] He opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and was the key vote to repeal the health care law and health care-related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[18] His healthcare voting record has given him an extremely low approval ratings from care-related interest groups such as the Association of University Centers on Disabilities and the American Nurses Association.[19]
Rokita is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, saying ""Im proud of my 'A' rating from the NRA. If we are going to keep up our traditions and pass them on to our children, we need leaders in Congress who understand, and will fight every day, to protect our 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms.""[16][20] Rokita voted in favor of a bill ""Requiring State Reciprocity for Carrying Concealed Firearms"" in November 2011.[21]
In 2010 Rokita signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.[22]
On April 2, 2014, Rokita introduced the Strengthening Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366; 113th Congress).[23] The bill would amend and reauthorize the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and would authorize the appropriation of $615 million for fiscal year 2015 and $3.8 billion over the 2015-2019 period to support federal educational research, statistical analysis, and other activities.[24]
Rokita is a member of the Director's Circle of the Indiana Council for Economic Education, the state bar association, the Knights of Columbus, and the National Rifle Association. A commercial-rated pilot, Rokita volunteers his time by flying people in need of non-emergency medical care to hospitals and clinics throughout the Midwest for treatment and is a member of the Indiana chapter of the International Flying Farmers. Rokita has also served as Chair of NASS's New Millennium Young Voters Summit of 2004, chair of the standing Voter Participation Committee and vice chair of the Securities Regulation Committee.[25]"

The bill would allow some charities, schools, and volunteer organizations to remain exempt from pension plan rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code.[14][15] Brooks argued that the bill was needed because ""some charities, schools and cooperatives are actually shutting down summer camps, cutting back on services to the community, or raising prices just to meet their pension obligations.""[15] The bill passed the House on March 24, 2014.

He took office on January 3, 2015.


Blum attended Loras College where he earned a degree in finance, and the University of Dubuque where he earned a masters degree in business administration. A businessman, Blum is a former CEO of Eagle Point Software (19902000) and owner of Digital Canal, a software company, since 2000.[1][2]
Blum, the son of a World War II veteran, was born and raised in Dubuque. He resides there with his wife, Karen and five children.[3] He is an Episcopal Christian.[2]
Blum was listed in the bankruptcy filing of professional hockey player Jack Johnson. Johnson, who was to be paid $5 million in salary from the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 201415 National Hockey League season, filed for federal bankruptcy on October 7, 2014, claiming assets of less than $50,000 and debts of more than $10 million. On November 20, 2014, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Blum made a $2 million loan to Johnson's family on March 10, 2011, at an interest rate of 12 percent. Blum sued Johnson within a month of the loan being made, and Johnson signed a settlement that allowed Blum to garnish 25 percent of Johnson's salary over much of the past two seasons to repay the debt.[4]
The newspaper reported Blum's loan was one of several taken out by Johnson's parents, relying on Johnson's future earnings, to pay for an expensive house in Manhattan Beach, California, as well as luxury cars and travel. Several loans, as well as the mortgage on the California house, went into default.
A spokesman for Blum provided a written statement on November 20, 2014, to the Radio Iowa news network that ""this is a difficult time for the Johnson family, and out of respect for their privacy Mr. Blum will not be discussing their private financial situation as the legal process takes its course."".[5]"
"160","","2007","1952","Iowa 2","Iowa State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Loebsack","David Loebsack","Democratic","Professor","United Methodist","David Wayne ""Dave"" Loebsack (born December 23, 1952) is the U.S. Representative for Iowa's 2nd congressional district, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes such cities as Davenport, Iowa City, Clinton and Ottumwa. Prior to entering Congress, he was a professor of political science.


Loebsack was born in Sioux City, Iowa and was raised in a single parent household of limited financial means. He graduated from East High School and attended college at Iowa State University. There, Loebsack earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in political science.
After receiving a PhD from the University of California, Davis, Loebsack took a job as a political science professor at Cornell College, a small liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, near Cedar Rapids. Today, he serves as a Professor Emeritus.[3]
Loebsack started the Linn Phoenix group, a fundraising arm of the Linn County Democrats.
Consistently, David Loebsack has voted in line with the Democratic Party. Out of 1551 total votes, he has voted with the Democratic Party 90% of the time. He has voted consistently to protect a woman's right to get an abortion and to pass measures that instill regulations that aim to protect the environment. He strongly believes in Wall Street reform and regulation, is generally in opposition to bailouts, and has stated that his role in government is to help stick up for the little guy.
David Loebsacks Interest Group Ratings concerning fiscal (economic) issues reinforce his general allegiance to party lines. Regarding the budget, spending, and taxes, he received 4% from Citizens Against Government Waste (2010), 36% from the National Journal Conservative Economic Policy Score (2011), and 64% from the National Journal Liberal Economic Policy Score (2011). Concerning Business and Consumers, Loebsack received 100% from the American Council of Engineering Companies (2009-2010), 0% from the Alliance for Worker Freedom (2008), and 66% from the National Small Business Association (2011).
Similar to Loebsacks Interest Group Ratings regarding the economy, his social ratings also adhere to party lines. Regarding civil liberties and civil rights, Loebsack has received 91% from the Human Rights Campaign (2009-2010), 95% from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (2009-2010), and 20% from the Arab American Institute (2009-2010). Interestingly, Loebsack has generally scored high among Interest Groups involved in civil liberties. Concerning the Environment, he received 94% from the League of Conservation Voters (2011) and 90% from Environment America (2011). Finally, his Interest Group Ratings concerning abortion reflect the Democratic party position, predictably receiving 100% from NARAL Pro-Choice America (2011) and 0% from the National Right to Life Committee (2011).
In 2006 Loebsack defeated 15-term incumbent Jim Leach in one of the biggest upsets of the cycle. Loebsack entered the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate after failing to get the required number of signatures, but did not face an actual primary opponent. The 2nd had been trending Democratic for some time (a Republican presidential candidate hasn't carried it since 1984), and was reckoned as the most Democratic district in the state. It was taken for granted that Leach would have been succeeded by a Democrat once he retired. Nonetheless, Leach was not on many Democratic target lists. Loebsack won largely by running up an 8,395-vote margin in Johnson County, home to Iowa City.
Loebsack was easily reelected in 2008, taking 57 percent of the vote over Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a doctor from Ottumwa and the former president of the state medical society.
Loebsack faced Miller-Meeks again in 2010 and had a much more difficult time of it than he had two years earlier. He prevailed with only 51% of the vote, largely by running up a 13,900-vote margin in Johnson County. Terry Branstad easily carried the district in his successful bid to reclaim the governorship. Chuck Grassley carried every county in the district except Johnson; in fact, Johnson was the only county Grassley lost in his bid for another term.
After redistricting moved Loebsack's home in Mount Vernon to the 1st District of fellow Democrat Bruce Braley, Loebsack moved to Iowa City in the reconfigured 2nd. The redrawn district is no less Democratic than its predecessor; it regained Davenport, which had been the anchor of the 2nd and its predecessors for decades before being shifted out of the district in the 2000s round of redistricting."

He was sworn into office on January 3, 2015.


Young attended Drake University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. From 2006 to 2013, he served as the chief of staff to Iowa Republican senator Chuck Grassley. He was previously chief of staff to Kentucky senator Jim Bunning from 1998 to 2006.[1][2][3]
Young is unmarried. He is a non-denominational Christian and lives in Van Meter.[1]
The Republican nomination was decided by a convention after none of the six candidates reached the 35 percent threshold required to make the general election ballot. This was the second time in 50 years that a convention picked a nominee and the first time since 2002, when then-State Senator Steve King won a convention held in Iowa's 5th congressional district to decide the Republican nominee for Congress.[5] A poll conducted by the conservative website Caffeinated Thoughts of 118 of the 513 delegates was held on June 910. David Young and Brad Zaun took 27% each, with Robert Cramer on 19%, Monte Shaw on 14%, Matt Schultz on 8% and Joe Grandanette on 3% with another 3% undecided. 34% chose Young as their second choice, with 17% choosing Cramer, Schultz or Zaun, 10% picking Shaw and 3% picking Grandanette with 8% undecided.[6]
On June 21, in what was described as a ""stunning upset"", David Young won the nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.[7]
On July 4, Zaun voiced his disappointment and suggested he would leave the Republican Party, leading some to encourage him to run for the seat as an Independent. He had previously announced that he would introduce legislation to hold primary runoff elections instead of conventions.[8] On July 10, Zaun announced that despite his frustrations, he would not leave the Republican Party or run as an Independent.[9]"

King is a member of the Republican Party.


King was born on May 28, 1949, in Storm Lake, Iowa, the son of Mildred Lila (ne Culler), a homemaker, and Emmett A. King, a state police dispatcher.[1] He has Irish, German, Welsh, and English ancestry.[2] King graduated in 1967 from Denison Community High School.[3] He is married to Marilyn, with whom he has three children. Raised a Methodist, King became a Catholic, his wife's faith, several years after marrying her.[2]
King attended Northwest Missouri State University from 1967 to 1970, and was a member of the Alpha Kappa Lambda Fraternity,[4] majoring in math. He did not graduate. Instead, he left before earning a degree to work in construction.[3][5] In 1975, he founded King Construction, an earth moving company. King founded the Kiron Business Association in the 1980s. His involvement with the Iowa Land Improvement Contractors' Association led to regional and national offices in that organization and a growing interest in public policy.[3][6]
In 1996, he ran for Iowa's 6th Senate district and defeated Democrat Eileen Heiden 64%-35%.[7] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic Party candidate Dennis Ryan 70%-30%.[8]
From 1996 to 2002, King served as an Iowa State Senator, representing the 6th district.[4] He assisted in eliminating the inheritance tax, authored and passed into law workplace drug testing, worked for strengthening parental rights, passing tax cuts for working residents of Iowa, and passing a law that made English the official language in Iowa.[9]
In 2002, after redistricting, King ran for the open Iowa's 5th congressional district. He ranked first in the four-way Republican primary with 31% of the vote.[10] He was unable to procure the 35% voting threshold needed to win; subsequently, a nominating convention was held, which led to a nomination for King, who defeated State Representative Brent Siegrist 51%-47%.[11][12] King won the general election, defeating Council Bluffs City Councilman Paul Shomshor 62%-38%. He won all the counties in the predominantly Republican district except Pottawattamie.[13]
King won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Joyce Schulte, 63%-37%. He won all the counties in the district except Clarke.[14]
In 2006, King won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Joyce Schulte, 59%-36%. He won all the counties in the district except Clarke and Union.[15][16]
King won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Democrat Rob Hubler, 60%-37%. For the first time in his career he won all 32 counties in his district.[17][18]
King won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Matt Campbell, 66%-32%. That was his highest percentage yet. King also won all 32 counties again.[19][20]
Iowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 Census. King's district was renumbered as the 4th District, and pushed well to the east, absorbing Mason City and Ames in the process. This placed King and his predecessor, Latham, in the same district. Latham opted to move to the reconfigured 3rd District to challenge Democratic incumbent Leonard Boswell. While the new district closely resembles the area Latham represented for his first four terms, it is much more competitive than King's old district. The old 5th had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+9 while the new 4th has a PVI of R+4. The new 4th was also mostly new to him; he only retained 45 percent of his former territory.
Soon afterward, former Iowa First Lady Christie Vilsack, the wife of former Governor and current Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, announced she was moving to the new 4th to challenge King. King received endorsement from Mitt Romney, who said, ""Im looking here at Steve King because this man needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington, D.C.""[21] King won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Vilsack, 53%-45%. King won all but seven counties, none of which he had previously represented: Webster, Boone, Story, Chickasaw, Floyd, Cerro Gordo, and Winnebago.[22][23] King later said of his 2012 victory, I faced $7 million, the best of everything Democrats can throw at me, their dream candidate and everything that can come from the Obama machine, and prevailed through all of that with 55 percent of my district that was new.[24]
On May 3, 2013, King announced via Twitter that he would not run for the U.S. Senate in 2014.[25]
King won re-election with 61.6% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Mowrer.[26]
King is considered an outspoken fiscal and social conservative. After winning the 2002 Republican nomination, he said that he intended to use his seat in Congress to ""move the political center of gravity in Congress to the right.""[27]
During the 110th Congress, King voted with the majority of the Republican Party 90.9% of the time.[28] King has continuously voted for Iraq War legislation, and has supported surge efforts and opposed a time table for troop withdrawals. During the 112th United States Congress King was one of 40 ""staunch"" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills.[29]
King scored a 100% rating with the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-life voting record. King also voted no on allowing human embryonic stem cell research.[30] King supports the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would ban federal funding of abortions except in cases of what the bill calls ""forcible rape"". This would remove the coverage from Medicaid that covers abortions for victims of statutory rape or incest.[31]
King supports a broad legal latitude for individual gun ownership.[32]
In February 2010, King tweeted about chasing and shooting a raccoon that had tried getting inside his house during a blizzard, receiving criticism from animal rights groups. He defended his actions, saying the animal might have been sick. [33]
In July 2012 King opposed the McGovern amendment (to the 2012 farm bill) to establish misdemeanor penalties for knowingly attending an organized animal fight and felony penalties for bringing a minor to such a fight. King was also one of 39 members of the House to vote against an upgrade of penalties for transporting fighting animals across state lines in 2007.[34] King received a score of zero on the 2012 Humane Society Legislative Fund's Humane Scorecard.[35][36][37] Afterwards, he put out a video clarifying his position where he defended his position by stating that it would be putting animals above humans if it was legal to watch humans fight, but not animals.[38][39]
In July 2012, King introduced an amendment to the House Farm Bill that would legalize previously banned animal agriculture practices such as tail-docking, putting arsenic in chicken feed, and keeping impregnated pigs in small crates. ""My language wipes out everything theyve done with pork and veal, King said of his amendment.[40] The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) President Wayne Pacelle said the measure could nullify ""any laws to protect animals, and perhaps... laws to protect the environment, workers, or public safety.""[41]
In May 2013, King introduced another amendment to the House Farm Bill, the Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA). He stated, ""PICA blocks states from requiring 'free range' eggs or 'free range' pork.""[42]
On 27 January 2014, the controversial provision was dropped from the House farm bill.[43]
On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that a state ban on same-sex marriage violated the Iowa constitution.[44] King soon commented that the judges ""should resign from their position"" and the state legislature ""must also enact marriage license residency requirements so that Iowa does not become the gay marriage Mecca.""[45] King, along with others, mounted a campaign against the retention of all three Iowa Supreme Court judges who ruled on the gay marriage case. King bought $80,000 of radio advertising across the state calling for Iowans to vote ""no"" on the judges. Subsequently, all three judges were not retained.[46]
King fought against Medicare and Medicaid paying for a number of medications such as Viagra, which he described as ""recreational drugs"".[47] King also has voted against each stimulus bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying, Our economy will not recover because government spends more. It will recover because people produce more.[48]
King gained prominence by being one of 11 in Congress to vote against the $52 billion Hurricane Katrina Aid package, claiming fiscal responsibility and the government needing a comprehensive plan for spending aid money.
In April 2006, conservative members of Congress proposed strengthening law enforcement against illegal immigration to the United States. When asked if ""the US economy simply couldn't function without"" the presence of illegal immigrants, King said that he rejected that position ""categorically"". He said the 77.5 million people between the ages of sixteen and sixty-five in the United States who are not part of the workforce ""could be put to work and we could invent machines to replace the rest.""[49]
In July 2013, speaking about proposed immigration legislation, King said of undocumented immigrants, ""For every one who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds  and theyve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.[50] Despite strong rebukes from Democrats and Kings fellow Republicans alike, with blunt rebukes from House Speaker John Boehner, who called his statements ""ignorant"" and hateful and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who called the comments ""inexcusable""; King continued to defend his comments, asserting he got the description from the Border Patrol.[51][52]
On March 7, 2008, during his press engagements to announce his reelection campaign, King made remarks about Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Hussein Obama and his middle name, saying:
I don't want to disparage anyone because of their race, their ethnicity, their name - whatever their religion their father might have been, I'll just say this: When you think about the optics of a Barack Obama potentially getting elected President of the United States  I mean, what does this look like to the rest of the world? What does it look like to the world of Islam? I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the al-Qaida, the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11.[53]
Then on March 10, King defended his comments to The Associated Press, saying ""(Obama will) certainly be viewed as a savior for them.... That's why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him.""[54]
Obama said he did not take the comments too seriously, describing King as an individual who thrives on making controversial statements to get media coverage. He said, ""I would hope Senator McCain would want to distance himself from that kind of inflammatory and offensive remarks."" The McCain campaign disavowed King's comments, saying ""John McCain rejects the type of politics that degrades our civicsand obviously that extends to Congressman King's statement.""[54]
In mid-January 2009, King acknowledged that terrorists were not dancing in the streets, and in fact ""They have made statements against Obama."" But he also claimed that he found Obama's decision to use his middle name ""Hussein"" when he was to be sworn in as the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009, to be ""bizarre"" and ""a double-standard"".[55]
King opposes race based quotas and affirmative action. King has stated: Theres been legislation thats been brought through this House that sets aside benefits for women and minorities. The only people that it excludes are white men...Pretty soon, white men are going to notice they are the ones being excluded.[56]
On February 26, 2010, King went to the House floor to protest the Democrats' handling of health care reform and said: ""Lobbyists do a very effective and useful job on this Hill... There's a credibility there in that arena that I think somebody needs to stand up for the lobby, and it is a matter of providing a lot of valuable information.""[57]
Steve King said on the floor of the House on June 14, 2010 that racial profiling is an important component of law enforcement: ""Some claim that the Arizona law will bring about racial discrimination profiling. First let me say, Mr. Speaker, that profiling has always been an important component of legitimate law enforcement. If you cant profile someone, you cant use those common sense indicators that are before your very eyes. Now, I think its wrong to use racial profiling for the reasons of discriminating against people, but its not wrong to use race or other indicators for the sake of identifying people that are violating the law.""[58] As an example of profiling, King described an instance when a taxi driver would stop for him before he had to hail a cab, just because he was in a business suit.[59]
Steve King said on a radio show on June 14, 2010 that President Obama's policies favor black people. On G. Gordon Liddy's radio program, King said, ""The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race - on the side that favors the black person in the case of Prof. Gates and officer Crowley.""[60]
After Todd Akin made a controversial statement about ""legitimate rape"" on August 19, 2012, King came to his defense, characterizing the critical response as ""petty personal attacks"", and calling Akin a ""strong Christian man"".[61][62] King said that Akin's voting record should be more important than his words.[63][64][65] Six months later, King's defense of Akin (who lost his race) was seen as politically damaging by Steven J. Law of the Conservative Victory Project, a group including Karl Rove that was working to discourage those they deemed unelectable conservative candidates, to enable more likely conservative candidates to gain office. Law said, ""We're concerned about Steve King's Todd Akin problem.""[66][67]
King dismissed the concern over global warming, labeling it a ""religion"" and claiming efforts to address climate change are useless.[68][69] A day after claiming that climate change was more ""a religion than a science,"" Steve King reasserted that many scientists overreact when discussing the consequences of global warming.[70] King said that, ""Everything that might result from a warmer planet is always bad in [environmentalists'] analysis. There will be more photosynthesis going on if the Earth gets warmer. ... And if sea levels go up 4 or 6 inches, I don't know if we'd know that. We don't know where sea level is even, let alone be able to say that it's going to come up an inch globally because some polar ice caps might melt because there's CO2 suspended in the atmosphere.""[71]"

The district, popularly known as the ""Big First,"" spills across a 63-county swath of central and western Kansasmore than half the state. Prior to entering Congress, he represented the 38th District of the Kansas Senate from 1997 until 2011.[2]


Huelskamp was born near and raised on the Huelskamp family farm in Fowler, Kansas. Pioneered by his grandparents Martin and Clara in 1926, the farm operation includes raising corn, cattle, wheat, milo, and soybeans. He attended elementary and high school in Fowler, where he was a Farm Bureau Youth Leader, a member of St. Anthonys Parish, and active in both 4-H and Future Farmers of America.
After attending seminary for two years in Santa Fe, Huelskamp continued his education at the College of Santa Fe (now Santa Fe University of Art and Design) and received his B.A. in social science education in 1991. He received his Ph.D. in political science, concentrating in agricultural policy from the American University in 1995.[3][4]
Now a politician, Huelskamp has also been a teacher and a budget and legislative analyst.[4][5]
Huelskamp and his wife Angela, live in Fowler, Kansas. They have four adopted children. Natasha, Rebecca, Athan, and Alex. [6]
In 1996, Huelskamp challenged Republican incumbent state senator Marian Reynolds in the primary and won by a landslide margin, taking 62 percent of the vote to Reynolds' 38 percent.[7] The youngest state senator in 20 years, he then won re-election by wide margins in 2000, 2004, and 2008.
Huelskamp served on the following legislative committees:[8]
Huelskamp previously served on the state's Ways and Means Committee but was removed due to clashes with colleagues and with the Committee's leadership.[9]
Seven-term Congressman Jerry Moran gave up the Big First seat to make a successful run for the United States Senate. This touched off a free-for-all in the Republican primarythe real contest in this heavily Republican district. Huelskamp finished first in the six-candidate primary field with 34.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring that he would be the district's next representative.[10]
Huelskamp ran against Democratic nominee Alan Jilka and Libertarian nominee Jack W. Warner. Huelskamp was endorsed by The Club for Growth, Mike Huckabee,[11][12] Conservative Leadership PAC, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee,[2] Ron Paul and Ken Blackwell.[13]
As expected, Huelskamp won the seat in a rout, taking 73 percent of the vote.[14]
Huelskamp ran unopposed in the general election.
Unlike the previous election, Huelskamp was challenged by a Republican Alan LaPolice in the primary.[15] Moreover, two Democrats ran for the primary Jim Sherow, a Kansas State University professor, and Bryan Whitney, a 2013 Wichita State University grad. Both LaPolice and Sherow critiqued Huelskamp for his failure to reach compromises with other politicians on issues like the Farm Bill.[16][17] As of July 15, 2014, Huelskamp had raised $538,359 for his campaign.[15]
In early 2012, Huelskamp introduced legislation that would ensure military chaplains could not be directed, ordered or required to perform any duty, rite, ritual, ceremony, service or function that is contrary to the conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain, or contrary to the moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplains faith group. The language appeared to be related to permitting same-sex marriages on military bases in states where such unions are permitted.[18]
On February 16, 2012, during a contentious three-hour House Budget Committee hearing with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Huelskamp warned of the looming threat of an economic crisis similar to the one then taking place in Europe. Representative Huelskamp accused Geithner and the entire Obama administration of failing to correct the U.S.'s debt crisis, which he believed would lead the country down the same path. Geithner replied that Huelskamp had an adolescent perspective on how to think about economic policy.[19]
After the United States Supreme Court declared the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA unconstitutional on June 26, 2013,[20] Huelskamp immediately announced that he would introduce a constitutional amendment to restore the Defense of Marriage Act.[21] He then went on The Steve Deace Show, a conservative radio program, to denounce the Supreme Court Justices. The idea that Jesus Christ himself was degrading and demeaning is what theyve come down to, he said. ""I cant even stand to read the decisions because I dont even think theyd pass law school with decisions like that.[22]
The House Republican Steering Committee removed Huelskamp from both the Budget Committee and the Agriculture Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.[23] At a Heritage Foundation lunch in the immediate wake of the removal, Huelskamp said: ""It's petty, it's vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles you will be punished for articulating those.""[24] He joined Justin Amash of Michigan and David Schweikert of Arizona in a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, demanding to know why they had lost their ""plum"" committee posts.[25]
Politico quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia as explaining that Huelskamp, Amash and Schweikert were removed for ""their inability to work with other members."" The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland ""said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]."" The three were described by Politico and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as ""jerks"" who ""made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team"".[26][27]:p.2
On January 3, 2013, Huelskamp appeared to be counting votes as part of an effort to unseat House Speaker John Boehner when the 113th Congress convened. Huelskamp nominated conservative Jim Jordan to replace Boehner. When asked about the anti-Boehner effort a spokesman for Huelskamp declined to comment.[28]"

As of the 113th Congress, she is the senior member of Kansas' House delegation and the Vice Chair of the House Republican Conference. She previously served as Kansas State Treasurer from 2003 to 2008, in the Kansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2000 and the Kansas Senate from 2000 to 2002.[1][2]


Jenkins was born in Holton, Kansas, and is a sixth-generation Kansan. She was raised on a dairy farm in Holton, where she attended high school. Later she graduated from Kansas State University and Weber State College with an accounting major and an economics minor. She is a Certified Public Accountant.[3]
Jenkins served for two years in the Kansas House of Representatives and for one term in the Kansas State Senate. She was elected State Treasurer in 2002 at which time she began serving in a number of organizations, including as president of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST).
On April 4, 2007, Jenkins announced that she had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission as a first step of running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Kansas's 2nd congressional district.[4]
Her opponent in the Republican primary was former U.S. Representative Jim Ryun, who served five terms before being defeated in 2006 by prior Democratic incumbent Nancy Boyda, who ran for reelection. In the campaign between Jenkins and Ryun, he criticized her for having voted for tax increases while a state legislator, and she criticized him for having supported earmarks.[5] Jenkins was seen as more moderate than Ryun and received the support of the Republican Leadership Council. The primary was held on August 5, 2008. Jenkins won the Republican nomination by approximately 1,000 votes.[6] In the general election, Jenkins went on to defeat Boyda 51%-46%.[7]
Jenkins won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic candidate Cheryl Hudspeth, 63%-32%.[8]
Jenkins won re-election to a third term, defeating Democratic candidate Tobias Schlingensiepen, 57%-39%.[9]
Jenkins was sworn into Congress in January 2009. During her first month in office, she introduced a bill that would ""prohibit the use of funds to transfer enemy combatants [in] Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.""
Jenkins favors making the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts permanent. She also favors eliminating the federal estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax.[10] She is a current signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[11] Jenkins has been critical of ""wasteful pork-barrel projects"" and earmarks. Jenkins has claimed that Democratic representatives ""tax and spend.""[10]
Jenkins has denounced ""unchecked illegal immigration"" that ""is wreaking havoc on our economic, legal, and national security interests.""[10] She opposes ""amnesty"" (allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents) and has called for an increase in border security "" through increasing border agents, building additional fences, and utilizing technology.""[10]
Jenkins claims that the oil price increases since 2003 are the result of ""excess regulation."" She supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and increased offshore drilling.[10]
In June 2013, after the United States farm bill failed again, Jenkins claimed she was disappointed in House Republicans, who were divided over the issue. She blamed the failure in the House on the inability to find common ground, stating that there are still too many Democratic and Republican members who allowed politics to trump progress.[12]
On February 28, 2014, Jenkins introduced the Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act (H.R. 4118; 113th Congress) into the House.[13] The bill would delay for one year the Affordable Care Act's penalty for not having insurance.[14]
On June 23, 2014, Jenkins introduced the Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 (H.R. 4935; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the child tax credit.[15]
At a town hall on August 19, 2009, Jenkins commented on President Barack Obama's policies, saying, ""Republicans are struggling right now to find the great white hope."" Jenkins said to the crowd. ""I suggest to any of you who are concerned about that, who are Republican, there are some great young Republican minds in Washington."" Jenkins then gave the names of several young, white Republicans.[16] ""The Great White Hope,"" a phrase that originated in the early 1900s, was a reference to any boxer whites hoped would finally defeat the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Johnson, who was black. Jenkins later apologized, clarifying her remarks and saying that ""I was explaining that there are some bright lights in the House, and I was unaware of any negative connotation. If I offended somebody, obviously I apologize.""[16][17] She had voted for a resolution urging President Obama to pardon black U.S. boxer Jack Johnson who was the target of an early 1900s racist plot and convicted in 1913 of transporting a white woman across state lines for immoral reasons, in July 2009, only one month earlier, that had text that explained it.[18] Jenkins responded by saying she had voted for the resolution without reading it first.[19]
Jenkins was assigned to the Committee on Financial Services including the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises and the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. She was named to the Ways and Means Committee when the Republicans gained control of the House for the 112th Congress.
Jenkins is a member of the Republican Study Committee, the Republican Main Street Partnership, and the Tea Party Caucus.
Jenkins has two children, Hayley and Hayden, and was married for 25years. Her husband Scott filed for divorce on Friday, November 7, 2008, shortly after her election to the U.S. House.[24][25]"

In February 2009, Yoder was pulled over for speeding on the K-10 expressway. After passing a field sobriety test, Yoder declined the officer's request to take a roadside Breathalyzer test. The officer cited Yoder for speeding and for refusing to take the breathalyzer test, and then let Yoder drive himself home. In a plea agreement, the speeding charge was dropped. Yoder pleaded guilty to refusing law enforcement's request for a breath test and paid a $165 fine.[7][8][9]
Yoder was first elected to the Kansas House of Representatives (20th district) in 2003. He was then subsequently re-elected to the office three times.[4] The district includes portions of Overland Park and Leawood.
As chair of the Kansas State House Appropriations Committee, he had the responsibility to balance the budget, cut government spending, oppose raising taxes, and allocate over $13 billion in state revenue to public schools, universities, prisons, social services and highways. In March 2010, the committee introduced its budget plan.[10] The proposed plan was defeated by a bipartisan group of moderate Republicans and Democrats in May 2010.[11] Yoder also served on the Judiciary Committee from 2003 through 2011.[4]
In 2010, Yoder received the ""Guardian of Small Business Award"" from the National Federation of Independent Business.[12] Yoder was also recognized with the ""Intergovernmental Leadership Award"" by the League of Kansas Municipalities.[13]
Upon arriving in Congress, Yoder participated in the recitation of a redacted version of the U.S. Constitution by members of congress on January 6, 2011. The event marked the first time the text of the nation's founding document had ever been read on the House floor.[14] At the beginning of the 113th Congress, Yoder again joined both Democrats and Republicans to take turns reading the entire U.S. Constitution aloud on the House floor. Yoder read the First, Second, and Third Amendments to the Constitution, and this marked only the second time in history the Constitution was read aloud on the House floor.[15] For the third time, Yoder took part in the reading of the Constitution on the floor of the House at the beginning of the 114th Congress.[16]
During his first term, Yoder introduced several bills to reform Congress;[17] including legislation to eliminate the lifetime pensions Members of Congress currently receive once they leave office,[17] and a bill to cut Members paychecks.[18] He has also sponsored bills in Congress aimed at cutting back on federal spending, balancing the federal budget, and helping small businesses.[19] Yoder supports a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.[20]
In 2011, Yoder and Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II (D-MO) were included in a Washington Post article about bipartisan opposition to the deal to raise the national debt ceiling.[21] Yoder is also an original co-sponsor of the Start-up Act 2.0,[19] along with Kansas Senator Jerry Moran, and a co-sponsor of the STEM jobs act to help boost science, technology, engineering, and mathematics employment.[22] Also in 2011, Yoder joined with Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) as coauthors to introduce the Federal Research Access Act (HR 5037).[23] The legislation would require federal agencies that spend more than $100 million in research to publish their research and make it available to the public for viewing. The bill has widespread bipartisan support.
Additionally in 2012, Yoder returned $120,000 of unused office funds to the U.S. Treasury  an amount in addition to two years of 5 percent cuts to office budgets imposed by the House passed budgets in 2011 and 2012.[24]
In February 2013, Yoder became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.[25] Yoder also reintroduced his legislation to eliminate lifelong congressional pensions and cut congressional pay.
In 2013, Yoder, along with Democrat Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) introduced the Email Privacy Act to update and reform existing online communications law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986. By June 2014, a majority of the House was expected to vote in favor.[26]
In December 2014, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act.[27] Yoder faced criticism from liberal groups for offering an amendment to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act that amended Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[28] Although critics claimed the amendment was written by Citigroup lobbyists, Yoder's amendment was identical to the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act, which passed the House of Representatives in 2013, by a 292-122 vote representing a veto-proof majority and including 70 Democrats in support.[29] Opponents of the provision claimed that it opens the door to another government bailout, similar to the Financial crisis of 200708.[30] Yoder forcefully responded to such claims, asserting that the measure was necessary to prevent smaller regional and community banks from being squeezed out of the swaps derivatives market entirely.[31][32][33]
In January 2015, Yoder reintroduced the Email Privacy Act with over 230 cosponsors, a majority of the House of Representatives.[34]
On August 31, 2011, Yoder was appointed to serve on the board at Gallaudet University, a liberal arts university for the deaf and hard of hearing in Washington, D.C.
In 2012, Yoder and Missouri Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II were jointly awarded the Consensus Civility award for their respectful and bipartisan efforts to work with members of both political parties.[35]
In an August 2012 story from the news outlet Politico, it was alleged that Yoder joined other Members of Congress in a spontaneous dive into the Sea of Galilee during a 2011 Congressional trip to Israel.[36][37] Yoder disrobed after a night of dining with his wife and others in a Tiberias restaurant. Yoder dove into the Sea of Galilee in a dark secluded area by the restaurant.[38] Yoder issued a statement apologizing to his constituents.[38]
On December 15, 2009, Yoder announced his intention to run for the open seat in the United States Congress.[39] On August 3, 2010, he won the Republican primary with 45% of the vote, running against former State Representative Patricia Lightner, Dave King, Gerry B. Klotz, Daniel Gilyeat, Jerry M. Malone, Craig McPherson, John Rysavy, and Jean Ann Uvodich.
Yoder's campaign platform centered on reducing wasteful spending in Washington, keeping taxes lower for Kansas families, and reforming the federal government.[40] He received the endorsement of the Kansas City Star, which stated, ""He believes government spending has to be controlled and is best used when it spurs economic growth, a good stance in this jobless recovery. His experience as the Kansas House appropriations committee would serve him well in Congress"".[41] Yoder also received endorsements from Kansans For Life,[42] National Rifle Association,[43] and the Johnson County Sun.[44]
In the general election, with 59% of the vote, Yoder won against Democratic nominee obstetrics nurse Stephene Moore and Libertarian nominee Jasmin Talbert.[45] Yoder outperformed prior Republican election year results in heavily Democratic Wyandotte and Douglas counties by 50 percent and took voter-rich, Republican-leaning Johnson County with a resounding 65 percent of the vote.[46] Yoder's win returned the 3rd district to the GOP after a 12-year hold by retiring Democratic incumbent Dennis Moore, husband of Stephene Moore.
During the campaign, Yoder set up the website stephenemoore.com in the name of Stephene Moore, his Democratic opponent. Yoder used the site to raise questions about her campaign and issue policy positions.[47] Moore's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission about the website on grounds that an ""unauthorized committee"" is not permitted to use the name of a candidate in the title of a special project or message if it ""clearly and unambiguously"" shows opposition to the named candidate. The FEC dismissed the complaint against Yoder.[48]
Yoder released several advertisements during the campaign, including one commercial with his wife, three nieces and a nephew walking through a field, drawing criticism from opponents who accused Yoder of implying that they were his own children.[49] Yoder faced similar criticism during one of his campaigns for the Kansas Legislature in which Yoder posted campaign photos of himself, his wife, and two nieces on his website.[49]
In the election of 2012, Yoder ran for re-election. He faced no opposition in the 2012 primary election.[50] In the general election, Yoder was endorsed by the Kansas City Star,[51] and faced Libertarian nominee Joel Balam, a college professor. Yoder won with 68.4% of the vote.[52]
In the election of 2014, Yoder again ran for re-election. He faced no opposition in the 2014 primary election. In the general election, Yoder faced Democrat nominee Kelly Kultala, a former member of the Kansas Senate. Yoder won with 60.02% of the vote.[53]

He is a member of the Republican Party.
The district covers much of the western part of the state, including Hopkinsville, Paducah, Henderson and Kentucky's share of Fort Campbell.


Whitfield was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky; his family later moved to Madisonville, Kentucky, where he graduated from Madisonville High School. He attended the University of Kentucky for both undergraduate and law school, where he was a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity.[2] He also attended the Wesley Theological Seminary. He served in the United States Army Reserve and reached the rank of First Lieutenant. He served as legal counsel to executives at Seaboard System Railroad of Washington. He served as a vice president for the later CSX Corporation in two different capacities and was the legal counsel to the chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission from 1991 to 1993.
Whitfield gained his first political experience as a Democratic member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979.
Whitfield is a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership. On his official website, he represents himself as a conservative who has consistently voted pro-life and ""supports allowing students to engage in voluntary school prayer."" He also lists military issues and encouraging the use of coal and nuclear power as substitutes for oil as two of his main priorities. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Whitfield has the seventh-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[3]
He was one of three Republicans who voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009.[4]
When chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations within the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Whitfield held hearings on child pornography and flag burning.
In 2011, Whitfield voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[5]
Whitfield introduced the Electricity Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826; 113th Congress) into the House on January 9, 2014.[6] The bill would repeal a pending rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on January 8, 2014.[7] The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new electricity-generating facilities that use coal or natural gas.[7][8] The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install carbon capture and sequestration technology.[7] Whitfield said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would ""make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal.""[8] Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule.[8]
Whitfield had been a Democrat for most of his life, but in 1994 filed to run in the 1st District as a Republican. He defeated the 1992 Republican nominee, Steve Hamrick, in the primary, and then narrowly defeated freshman Democratic Congressman Tom Barlow by only 2,500 votes. He narrowly defeated Dennis Null in 1996 even as Bill Clinton carried the district, but hasn't faced a close race since. Although Democrats have a nearly 2-to-1 edge in registration, they tend to be very conservative on social issues, a trend that has helped Whitfield strengthen his hold on the district. Whitfield's major legislative accomplishments are creating the 170,000 acre of National Recreation Area at the Land between the Lakes, introducing and passing legislation to create a Health Compensation Program at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion plant. He paid over $315,000,000 in compensation to the 3,139 employees and survivors. He also helped create the first Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plan for seniors and is an active advocate for the humane treatment of animals.[9]
Whitfield's wife, Constance Whitfield, is a former Assistant Secretary of the Interior and now a paid lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States"

Located in central Kentucky, the district covers Fort Knox, Owensboro, Bowling Green and Danville. He has served in that role since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Kentucky Senate.


Guthrie was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Carolyn P. (ne Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie.[1] He earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematical economics from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1987[2] and his Master's of Public and Private Management from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1997.
Guthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in Bowling Green. Guthrie has previously served as a field artillery officer in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
Guthrie represented the 32nd district in the Kentucky Senate from 1999 to 2008, where he served as vice chairman of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee, and was chairman of the Transportation Committee.
In the 2008 congressional general election, he defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senator David Boswell, for the right to succeed the retiring Republican U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.
This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years. While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, they are very conservative on social issues, a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election. Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate John McCain carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.
The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.
Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.
In December 2013, Suzanne Miles, Guthrie's district representative in Owensboro, won a special election to the 7th District seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. She became the 46th Republican member of the chamber, the highest since 1921.[3]
Based on a questionnaire and the votes that the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund considered to be the most important in 1998, they assigned Representative Guthrie a grade of B.[4] He has since received A's from the NRA and various other Second Amendment rights advocacy groups. In 2011, Guthrie voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[5] In July 2013, Guthrie voted against the move to defund the National Security Agency due to the alleged privacy violations reported by whistleblower Edward Snowden.[6]
Guthrie is not particularly affiliated with the Tea Party movement and unlike the majority of members of his own party voted to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.[7]
With his family, Guthrie attends the Lehman Avenue Church of Christ in Bowling Green, Kentucky, as reported by the Christian Chronicle; Michael Greene, minister of the Lehman Avenue congregation, said that he has no doubt ""Guthrie's faith will play a positive role"" in representation of the 2nd district.[8]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party and a former member of the Republican Party.


Yarmuth was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Edna E. (ne Klein) and Stanley R. Yarmuth. He is descended from Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria.[1] He graduated from Atherton High School.[2] He graduated from Yale University, majoring in American Studies.[2]
He worked for Republican U.S. Senator Marlow Cook from 1971 to 1975, then returned to Louisville and launched his publishing career by founding the Louisville Today magazine, which operated from 1976 to 1982. He later worked as a vice-president of University Relations at the University of Louisville.[2]
In 1990, Yarmuth founded the Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO), a weekly newspaper for which he wrote a generally progressive political column that was usually featured on the first page. In 2003, Yarmuth sold LEO to a company owned by Times Publishing Company of Pennsylvania, owner of the Erie Times-News. Yarmuth remained on board as a columnist and consultant until January 2006, when he put his column on hiatus to run for Congress.[2]
Yarmuth took office on January 3, 2007. As of 2014, he is serving his fourth term as Congressman.
After his first year in Congress, Yarmuth donated his post-tax congressional salary of just over $120,000 to various charities in Louisville.[3]
On February 8, 2008, Yarmuth endorsed Barack Obama in his bid for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States.[4]
On September 29, 2008, Yarmuth voted against the TARP bailout plan, as negotiated by Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Republican President George W. Bush, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[5] However, he did vote in favor of the second version of the bailout bill.[6]
Yarmuth said he was so ""nauseated"" by a moment of silence for Michael Jackson on the House floor that he left the chamber. ""I thought it was outrageous,"" he said. ""In my two and a half years, we've not done this for anybody else. We've done it for former members and that's about it.""[7]
After defeating Northup for the second time, Yarmuth was rewarded by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee with a spot on the influential Ways and Means Committee. On the committee, Yarmuth worked on issues on which he campaigned before the 2008 general election: Social Security, pension, Medicare, and Medicaid issues.
At a September 2009 town hall meeting, constituents were unhappy with Yarmuth's decision to support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ""Yarmuth stayed calm in the face of boos and catcalls from some in the audience"" according to an Associated Press report. ""He warned that the current health care system is an unsustainable drain on businesses and the nation's economy.""[8]
In 2011, Yarmuth introduced a bill alongside Republican Congressman Walter Jones that would seek to overturn key parts of the controversial Citizens United court case. The legislation would also give Congress the power to enact mandatory public financing for Congressional candidates and create a national holiday for voting purposes.[9]
In 2011, Yarmuth voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 due to a controversial provision which allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[10][11]
Yarmuth filed candidacy papers on January 31, 2006, to represent Kentucky's 3rd congressional district. Having won the Democratic primary on May 16, defeating Andrew Horne, Burrell Charles Farnsley and James W. Moore, he defeated incumbent Anne Northup (R) in November of that year.
On August 7, 2006, The Courier-Journal reported that The Hill revealed a week before that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had earmarked $51.5 million for television advertising in 32 congressional districts across the nation, but none for Yarmuth's challenge in the Third Congressional District.[12]
On October 20, a Courier-Journal article stated that a WHAS11/SurveyUSA poll revealed the race had tightened dramatically, with Yarmuth leading Northup 48 to 47 percent. Another poll a month earlier had Northup leading by 6 points.[13] A WHAS11/SurveyUSA poll released on November 2 showed Yarmuth leading Northup 52 to 44 percent.[14]
On October 26, Yarmuth told Courier-Journal reporter Kay Stewart that he would donate his congressional salarywhich would be $168,500 in 2007to local charity.[15]
Because polls close early in Kentucky, many analysts saw this race as a key indicator and it immediately became one of the most watched House races in the nation.
Yarmuth defeated Northup in the general election. He garnered 122,139 votes (51%) to Northup's 116,157 votes (48%). Independent candidates garnered 2,896 votes (1%).
Yarmuth ran unopposed in the primary, and faced Anne Northup in a rematch of the 2006 general election.[16][17][18]
Yarmuth won the 2008 election with 59% of the vote.[19]
Yarmuth was challenged by Republican Todd Lally and Independent Michael D. Hansen. Yarmuth was re-elected successfully.[20]
Yarmuth was challenged by Republican Brooks Wicker and was re-elected successfully.
Yarmuth was challenged by Republican Michael McFarlane and was re-elected successfully. Yarmuth won 63.5% of the votes cast.
In 2003, Yarmuth and former WHAS-AM radio talk show host John Ziegler debated political issues on the weekly WAVE program Yarmuth & Ziegler, with Yarmuth taking the liberal side and Ziegler, the conservative side. On a successor program, Hot Button, which ran from September 2004 to December 2005, he faced off with conservative Jim Milliman.
Yarmuth appeared on the March 8, 2007, episode of The Colbert Report in the show's ""Better Know a District"" series. In a parody of Yarmuth's former Yarmuth & Ziegler debate series, host Stephen Colbert prodded Yarmuth into a point/counterpoint style debate. After agreeing to the ""debate,"" Colbert forced Yarmuth to defend the shredding of kittens in wood chippers, which Yarmuth gamely proceeded to do. Colbert referred to Yarmuth as a real life Bruce Wayne, and presented him with a framed print of his congressional photo with a Batman mask photoshopped over his face.[21]
Yarmuth has served on many boards including the Bingham Child Guidance Center and Kentucky Country Day School. He is Kentucky's first Jewish congressman. Yarmuth and his wife, Cathy Yarmuth, have one son, Aaron, who is a graduate of Kentucky Country Day."

In 1993, at MIT, he and his wife started a company called SensAble Devices Inc.[4][5] Massie was the winner in 1995 of the $30,000 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for inventors.[3] The company was re-incorporated as SensAble Technologies, Inc., in 1996 after partner Bill Aulet joined the company.[4] They raised $32 million of venture capital, had 24 different patents, and 70 other employees.[6]
Massie sold the company, and he and his wife moved back to their hometown in Lewis County. They raised their children on a farm,[5][7] where he built his own off-the-grid timberframe house.[8]
In 2010, Massie pursued the office of Judge Executive of Lewis County, in order to fight what he considered wasteful spending and intrusion into the lives of the county's citizens by the government.[5] Massie won the primary election, defeating the incumbent by a large margin,[5] and went on to defeat his Democratic opponent by nearly 40 points.[9] Massie also campaigned for then-U.S. Senate candidate Rand Paul, speaking to various Tea Party groups on his behalf.[5]
Massie resigned as Lewis County Judge-Executive, effective June 30, 2012.
In December 2011, Congressman Geoff Davis announced his decision to retire from his seat in Kentucky's 4th congressional district. Massie announced his decision to join the race on January 10, 2012.[10] Massie was endorsed by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky,[11][12] and Rand's father, Texas Congressman Ron Paul.[13][14] He also received endorsements from FreedomWorks,[15] Club for Growth,[16][17] Gun Owners of America,[18] and Young Americans for Liberty.[19]
On May 22, 2012, Thomas Massie was elected as the Republican nominee for the 4th congressional district, beating his closest opponents, State Representative Alecia Webb-Edgington and Boone County Judge Executive Gary Moore, by a double-digit margin.[20][21] In his victory speech, Massie thanked ""the Tea Party, the liberty movement, and grassroots Ronald Reagan Republicans.""[22] Massie was challenged by Democrat Bill Adkins in the general election, and was expected to win the election by a wide margin.[20][23] Massie resigned as Lewis County Judge-Executive, effective June 30, 2012, in order to focus on his campaign for U.S. Congress, and allow an election to be immediately held in order to replace him.[24] He was succeeded by Deputy Lewis County Judge-Executive John Patrick Collins, who was appointed temporarily by Governor Steve Beshear.[25] On July 31, 2012, Congressman Geoff Davis resigned from office, citing a family health issue for his abrupt departure.[26] On August 1, 2012, the Republican Party committee for Kentucky's 4th Congressional district voted unanimously to endorse Massie as the party's nominee once a special election was called.[27] A special election was called by Governor Steve Beshear to take place on the same day as the general election, November 6, 2012.[28] This meant that Massie would be running in two separate elections on the same dayone for the right to serve the final two months of Davis' term, another for a full two-year term.[29]
On November 6, 2012, Massie won both the general and special elections, defeating his opponent by a wide margin in both elections.[30]
Massie was sworn into office immediately after the election, on November 13, 2012, filling the vacancy left by Geoff Davis.[31] Massie was selected to serve on three committees, including the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Committee on Science, Space and Technology.[32] He was also selected to become Chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, replacing outgoing Chairman Ben Quayle.[33]
Massie voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, otherwise known as the NDAA,[34] and co-sponsored legislation in favor of industrial hemp,[35] and repealing federal gun free zones in schools.[36] Massie voted against the fiscal cliff deal, saying ""This plan is Washington kicking the can down the road [...] The modest spending cuts agreed to in the 2011 debt ceiling deal are postponed by this bill. This bill does nothing to reform our bloated tax code  in fact the bill perpetuates Obama's failed stimulus spending within the tax code. Finally, it fails to address entitlement reform or the solvency of Social Security and Medicare."" [37]
Massie broke from the majority of his party by opposing the reelection of Speaker of the House John Boehner, instead casting his vote for Republican Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan.[38] In May 2013, he voted against the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, which passed 390-to-3, which makes it a crime to lie for profit about receiving military medals or decorations.[39] In December 2013, he was the only congressman to vote against the Undetectable Firearms Act, a 25-year ban on firearms that can avoid detection by metal detectors and X-ray machines.[40]
In March 2014, Massie voted against a bill to name Israel an American strategic partner. Massie voted no because this bill would have subsidized green energy companies in Israel. He said he wouldnt support subsidies for American green energy companies, let alone foreign ones. [41] However, the bill passed by a margin of 410-to-1.[42] In May 2014, Massie objected to a voice vote to award golf star Jack Nicklaus a gold medal recognizing his ""service to the nation"" for promoting good sportsmanship and philanthropy, and demanded a roll call vote.[39] The vote passed easily over his objection: 371-to-10.[39] Through mid-June 2014, Massie had voted ""no"" at least 324 times in the 113th Congress  opposing one of every three measures that came to the House floor. Politico named him ""Mr. No"".[39]
Massie identifies himself as a constitutional conservative. He believes in intellectual property and thinks it is necessary for incentivizing innovation. Massie has remarked that this is one of the areas in which he does not identify as libertarian.[43]
Massie operates a cattle farm in Garrison, Kentucky with his wife Rhonda and their four children. They live in a solar-powered home that Massie built himself.[44][45]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.


Rogers was born in Barrier, Kentucky, attended Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green and received a baccalaureate degree (A.B.) and a law degree (LL.B.) from the University of Kentucky at Lexington. Rogers served in the Kentucky and North Carolina Army National Guard.""[1]
As a lawyer Rogers was in private practice and was elected to serve as Commonwealth's Attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle counties in Kentucky, an office he held from 1969 to his election to Congress in 1980.
Rogers was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1979. He was on the ballot with former Governor of Kentucky Louie B. Nunn. He lost to Democratic nominee Martha Layne Collins 63%-37%.[2] The following year Rogers won election to Congress.
In 1980, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Tim Lee Carter of Kentucky's 5th congressional district decided to retire. Rogers won the Republican primary with a plurality of 23 percent. The losing candidates included the 1971 gubernatorial nominee, Tom Emberton.[3] He won the general election with 67% of the vote.[4] He won re-election with at least 65 percent of the vote since then, except in 1992. That year, he defeated Democratic State Senator John Doug Hays 55-45 percent.[5]
Rogers is the longest serving Kentucky Republican ever elected to federal office.[citation needed] Rogers served as a delegate to multiple Republican National Conventions.
In 2001, the City of Williamsburg, Kentucky named their new water park and miniature golf facility the Hal Rogers Family Entertainment Center[6] as a ""thank-you for all of the federal money he has brought back to Whitley County, the City of Williamsburg, and the other 40 counties he represents.""[7]
On the House/Senate conference decision to bolster the Department of Commerce and support the Clinton Administration priorities, President Clinton remarked, ""I commend the congressional leadership, Senator Ernest Hollings, Senator Pete Domenici, Congressman Neal Smith, and Congressman Harold Rogers, for their foresight and support in revitalizing this country through these programs. It is a dramatic step forward for the United States toward a solid economic future.""[8]
Similar praise comes from former President George H.W. Bush, ""I'm pleased to see these three distinguished Members of the Congress here. You may not remember this ancient history, but Hal Rogers was my Kentucky State chairman in my quest for the Presidency. And what a job that guy did, I'll tell you.""[9]
Kentucky state biographer Amy Witherbee commented on Rogers service, ""Rogers' multiple roles on the Appropriations Committee have honed his skills as a bipartisan negotiator, and his economically challenged district often prompts him to stray from hard-line conservative stances. Although voting with his party against raising environmental standards on sports utility vehicles and against a controversial amendment that would have prohibited oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Rogers has been the creator and leading proponent of large environmental protection and clean-up programs throughout the Appalachian region.""[10]
""In addition, Rogers' reluctance to involve the federal government in local issues has not deterred him from supporting a multitude of economic development programs aimed at creating new job bases in economically disadvantaged areas, and particularly in Appalachia. In 1993, Rogers was one of only three Republicans to vote for then-President Bill Clinton's economic stimulus package. In March 2003, Rogers' ability to work through the bipartisan tangles of the Appropriations Committee won him the chairmanship on the subcommittee designated to control funding for the new Department of Homeland Security,"" noted Witherbee.
Ready evidence is found on March 20, 2008, when the invitation to testify in support of environmental legislation by Democrat House Majority Leader Rep. Rocky Adkins,[11] and, on the same day, a rare invitation to speak from the Senate floor was afforded by Republican Senate Majority Leader Senator David L. Williams of Cumberland County as part of the Senate's unanimously passed bipartisan resolution honoring Rogers for his service.[12]
Rogers called a bill to reduce funding for law enforcement ""the result of this new Republican majority's commitment to bring about real change in the way Washington spends the people's money.""[13]
In 2011, Rogers voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[14]
Rogers has been widely criticized by both liberal and conservative pundits for his priorities when it comes to national security. National Review referred to Rogers as ""a national disgrace""[15] and Rolling Stone named him one of America's ""Ten Worst Congressmen"", calling him ""Bin Laden's Best Friend"" due to the fact that Rogers steered federal homeland security money away from large cities to his home district, which critics claim is one of the least likely terrorist targets in America because of its lack of any notable monuments or population centers.[16] In 2007, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Congressman Rogers to its list of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress.[17]
On May 14, 2006, the New York Times reported that Rogers had used his legislative position as chairman of the House subcommittee that controls the Homeland Security budget to create ""jobs in his home district and profits for companies that are donors to his political causes.""[18] The Lexington Herald-Leader in 2005 called Rogers the ""Prince of Pork"".[19] The Times article reported that Rogers had inserted language (""existing government card issuance centers"") into appropriations bills that effectively pushed the federal government into testing at a cost of $4 million older, inappropriate technology for a new fraud-resistant green card for permanent legal immigrants, at a production plant in Corbin, Kentucky, within Rogers' district. The study concluded that the smart card approach was far superior. The Times found that about $100,000 in contributions had come to Mr. Rogers from parties with at least some ties to the identification card effort.[20]
In response to these critics, Rogers has stated, ""It should surprise no one that this article from Rolling Stone regarding my activity in connection with the Transportation Worker Identity Card (TWIC) is grossly incorrect, and highly slanderous,"" the congressman said. ""A true and honest analysis would reveal that my sole interest in TWIC is simply to protect America's seaports, airports, and other transportation facilities from terrorist penetration. To purport that my actions have compromised national security in an effort to bring jobs to Kentucky or for personal gain is an absolute lie.""[21]
After Iran objected to the interim deployment of an Afloat Forward Staging Base to counter their threats to close the Persian Gulf, Rogers cut the funding for the project.[22][23]
On June 12, 2013, the White House threatened to veto the MilCon/VA spending bill, because Republicans did not agree with the Senate's number of $1.058 trillions intended for military operations and research, after the MilCon/VA bill received 421 bipartisan votes in House. ""We're marking up to $967 billion, the top line under current law"", said Rogers, who currently serves as the chairman of United States House Committee on Appropriations.[24]
On January 15, 2013, Rogers introduced the bill H.R. 298, officially titled ""To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield located in Pulaski and Wayne Counties, Kentucky, and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System, and for other purposes.""[25] The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield in Kentucky (relating to the Battle of Mill Springs fought on January 19, 1862, in Pulaski and Wayne Counties during the Civil War) and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System (NPS).[25][26] Rogers said that ""the Battle of Mill Springs is a source of great pride and interest to the people I serve.""[27] Rogers argued that the Battlefield was a ""jewel"" and would be ""an excellent addition to the National Park Service.""[27]
On March 5, 2014, Rogers introduced the To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would provide loan guarantees to Ukraine of up to $1 billion, part of the American response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.[28] The bill passed in the House on March 6, 2014.[29]
In 2014, Roger's committee called for cuts in the National Nuclear Security Administration budget that cast doubt on the US Navy's ability to provide a Ohio Replacement Submarine class.[30]
On July 29, 2014, Rogers introduced the Making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 (H.R. 5230; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide supplemental FY2014 appropriations to several federal agencies for expenses related to the rise in unaccompanied alien children and alien adults accompanied by an alien minor at the southwest border.[31] The bill would also change the procedures for screening and processing unaccompanied alien children who arrive at the border from certain countries.[31] The bill would provide $659 million in supplemental funding.[32] Rogers urged members to pass the bill, arguing that ""more and more immigrants will continue to flood across the border if you fail to act"" because resources were running out.[32]
Rogers had three children with his wife, Shirley Rogers. She died of cancer in 1995. Rogers married the former Cynthia Doyle Stewart in May 1999. They were introduced in 1998 by former Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist, an old House colleague, and were married at the Tennessee governor's mansion."

University of Kentucky College of Law","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Barr_(U.S._politician)","Andy Barr","Republican","Attorney","Episcopalian","Garland Hale ""Andy"" Barr IV (born July 24, 1973) is an American politician and lawyer who has served as the United States Representative for Kentucky's 6th congressional district since 2013.
A native of Lexington, Kentucky, Barr completed undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia in 1996. While in college, he worked as an intern for Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republican National Committee. After graduation, he worked as a legislative assistant for then-Missouri Representative Jim Talent before enrolling at the University of Kentucky College of Law. He completed his law degree in 2001 and joined the Lexington firm of Stites & Harbison. After representing the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ernie Fletcher in a dispute over residency requirements in 2003, he joined Fletcher's transition team after his election and eventually became part of his executive staff. He was not implicated in the hiring scandal that plagued Fletcher's administration, and in fact, claimed that he had warned administration officials of potential violations of the state merit system.
Barr returned to private practice after Fletcher was defeated for reelection. In 2009, he announced he would challenge Democrat Ben Chandler in the 2010 midterm elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted the race as part of their strategy to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and provided considerable financial backing to Barr's campaign. Chandler won the election by fewer than 700 votes, and Barr finally conceded defeat after a recanvass failed to yield an appreciable difference in the margin. In mid-2011, however, he announced he would again challenge Chandler in 2012. Again aided by campaign funds from the national party which were countered by contributions to Chandler by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Barr won the election by over 11,000 votes.


Barr was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and is the son of Garland Hale Barr III and Rev. Donna R. (Faulconer) Barr.[1] The Barr family has been in Lexington for generations, and Barr Street in that city is reportedly named for one of Barr's ancestors.[2] His father founded the law firm of Barr, Anderson and Roberts and his mother is a deacon in the Episcopal Diocese of Lexington.[1]
Barr graduated from Henry Clay High School in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1992.[3] He attended the University of Virginia where, as a contributor to a conservative campus publication called The Virginia Advocate, he was highly critical of then-President Bill Clinton for allegedly evading the draft.[2] While in college, he was also an intern for U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republican National Committee.[2] In 1993, he was arrested in Key West, Florida, and charged with possessing a fake Mississippi driver's license.[2] He pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to eight hours of community service.[2]
Barr graduated with a bachelor's degree in government and philosophy in 1996.[2] From 1996 until 1998, he worked as a legislative assistant to Jim Talent, then a U.S. Representative from Missouri.[3] In 1999, he was charged with public intoxication in Lexington, a charge that was dismissed four months later.[2] In 2001, Barr earned a law degree from the University of Kentucky College of Law.
Commencing practice in Lexington, he joined the Fayette County Bar Association Young Lawyers Section and co-founded the Lexington Charity Club a non-profit organization of young men raising money for charitable causes with Lee Greer and Rob Lewis.[4] In 2002, he joined the liability defense service group and the business litigation service group at the Lexington law firm of Stites & Harbison.[5] While there, he worked for former Democratic Kentucky Attorney General and future Governor Steve Beshear, who urged him to get involved in state politics.[3] Barr and colleague Brad Cowgill were employed by Republican gubernatorial candidate Ernie Fletcher in 2003 to fight charges that Fletcher's running mate, Hunter Bates, did not meet the state's residency requirements for eligibility for the office of lieutenant governor.[2] A judge ruled against Bates, and he was dropped from the ticket.[2]
After Fletcher won the election, Barr was named to the governor-elect's transition team in the Public Protection and Regulation Cabinet.[6] Ultimately, Fletcher chose Barr as general counsel for the governor's office of local development.[7] When Fletcher declared April to be Child Abuse Prevention Month in Kentucky, Barr wrote Fletcher's speech for the occasion.[2] While researching the speech, he made contact with the non-profit group Prevent Child Abuse in Kentucky.[2] He became interested in the organization's mission and was elected to its board of directors in 2004; he served as vice-president of the organization in 2007 and president in 2008 and 2009.[2][8]
Fletcher's term in office was marred by a hiring scandal that involved violations of the state merit system.[3] Barr was not implicated in the scandal; he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Fletcher's Local Initiatives for a New Kentucky (LINK) outreach program a sub-unit of the office of local development stopped recruiting and vetting individuals for merit positions in the executive branch after he briefed officials about an opinion issued by the Executive Branch Ethics Commission during the administration of Fletcher's predecessor, Paul E. Patton, regarding acceptable and unacceptable hiring under the merit system.[7] The Herald-Leader later requested copies of any employment recommendations made by LINK employees, but Barr refused the request, citing an exemption in Kentucky's Open Records Act that provides exemptions for ""preliminary drafts, notes and correspondence"" of state employees.[9]
In 2007, Fletcher's general counsel resigned to become executive director of the Kentucky Bar Association; deputy general counsel David E. Fleenor was elevated to general counsel, and Barr replaced Fletcher as deputy general counsel.[10] In this capacity, he authored a defense of Fletcher's executive order that the Ten Commandments be posted in the rotunda of the state capitol alongside other historical documents.[2] Fletcher was defeated for reelection in 2007 and before his term expired, he named Barr to the state Public Advocacy Commission.[11]
In April 2008, Barr returned to private practice as an associate at the law firm of Kinkead and Stilz; he also worked as a part-time instructor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Kentucky.[3][12] He was chosen as an alternate delegate to the 2008 Republican National Convention and served as vice-president of the Fayette County Republican Party.[13][14]
After forming an exploratory committee in September 2009, on November 10, 2009, Barr became the first Republican to formally announce that he would seek his party's nomination to challenge incumbent 5th district congressman Ben Chandler.[3] In the announcement, he touted his opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (which Chandler had also opposed) and the American Clean Energy and Security Act (which Chandler supported).[3] Barr's campaign raised far more money than those of any of his five opponents in the Republican primary.[15] Barr garnered 31,255 votes in the primary, while his opponents' totals ranged from 4,789 to 1,880.[16]
In an interview with WKYT-TV in July, Barr further elaborated on his platform.[17] Declaring his support for the free market, he denounced the recently signed DoddFrank Act that enacted new regulations on the banking industry.[17] He called for an end to the practice of politicians earmarking funds for special projects in their districts, a position that put him at odds with state party leaders like McConnell and long-time 5th district Congressman Hal Rogers.[17] Although he supported strengthening security along the U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration, he stated his belief that fellow Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul's plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.[17]
The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Barr's race against Chandler as part of their strategy to gain control of the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, and Ohio Congressman John Boehner who stood to become Speaker of the House if the Republicans gained a majority visited the state to campaign on Barr's behalf.[18] Substantial amounts of money from political groups outside the state aided both candidates and spawned a number of negative campaign ads.[18] Chandler started the barrage in August with ads alluding to Barr's arrest in Florida for using a fake ID and seeking to tie him to the wrongdoing of the Fletcher administration.[18] Barr countered with ads criticizing Chandler's support of cap-and-trade legislation an unpopular vote in coal-dependent Kentucky and his vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Barr characterized as a waste of taxpayer money that did little to stimulate an economic recovery.[18]
Unofficial election day results showed Chandler scoring a narrow victory over Barr, but the race was so close that Barr refused to concede.[19] When the official results were released, Chandler had received 119,812 votes to 119,163 for Barr.[19] Barr petitioned Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson for a recanvass of the voting machines in the district, but this yielded only one additional vote for Barr.[19] On November 12, ten days after the election, Barr announced that he would concede the election to Chandler rather than requesting a full recount.[19]
On June 9, 2011, Barr announced that he would again challenge Chandler for his seat in the 2012 elections.[20] The announcement was immediately hailed by Texas Congressman Pete Sessions, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, who said, ""we need Republicans like Andy Barr to join us in Congress to cut spending, lower taxes and reduce the national debt.""[20] Chandler responded to the announcement by declaring, ""Next year, voters will have a very simple choice to make: whether to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, or to end them,"" an allusion to Barr's publicly expressed support for Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan's budget proposal.[20]
In July 2012, Roll Call reported that ""a wide swath of influential Republicans in Kentucky see Barr's campaign as something of a lost cause...In the eyes of those who know Kentucky best, from Washington, D.C., to Frankfort, this isn't much of a race right now.""[21]
Barr easily turned back token opposition in the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign.[22] When Chandler decided not to attend the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Barr charged that he was trying to avoid association with President Barack Obama, who was seeking a second term but who was unpopular with many voters in Kentucky.[23] A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection.[23] Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry.[24] Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, stating that he should spend the time in his district, getting to know the people there better.[25] They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech was a picture of the city of Louisville, which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.[24]
Both candidates began their TV ad campaigns with more positive ads; Barr's wife appeared in his first ad, touting him as a ""family man"", while Chandler tried to combat Barr's charges of fiscal liberalism by releasing an ad criticizing excessive government spending.[26] Tea Party-backed Kentucky Senator Rand Paul endorsed Barr despite differences between the two on some policy matters, including Barr's support for the Patriot Act.[26] The positive tone did not hold as the race tightened, however. Chandler's campaign attacked Barr for using a mining executive from Morganfield which is well outside the 6th district as a coal miner from Estill County which is in the district.[27] The campaign's charges that the man depicted was ""not a miner"" prompted him to threaten a suit for defamation, and he produced copies of his certified miner credentials in rebuttal to the charge.[27] The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also bought ads that again raised the issue of Barr's previous conviction and his association with Fletcher.[28]
Barr won the election by a vote of 153,222 to 141,436.[29]
Barr faced Democrat Elisabeth Jensen in the General Election of 2014. 147,404 votes were cast for Barr, and 98,290 to Jensen, about 60% to 40% respectively. [30]
Barr's two-year term began on January 3, 2013.
Barr supported the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC).[31] Barr testified in favor of the bill because it would ""remove the requirement that Valley View Ferry captains be licensed through the Coast Guard, and instead allow the state to implement its own licensing requirement.""[32] At present, the local ferry has had to cut back on hours because the ferry has been unable to find a new captain for ferry due to the stringent Coast Guard requirements to get a merchant mariner license, despite the fact that the ferry only travels 500 feet on steel cables, without any steering capabilities.[32] If the bill were to pass, the state government would be able to lower the licensing requirement for such a small ferry with only limited capabilities.
On July 11, 2013, Barr introduced the CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act (H.R. 2672; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as ""rural"" for purposes of a federal consumer financial law.[33] One practical effect of having a county designated ""rural"" is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule.[34][35]
On March 6, 2014, Barr introduced the Restoring Proven Financing for American Employers Act (H.R. 4167; 113th Congress), a bill that would ""exempt existing collateralized loan obligations from the so-called ""Volcker Rule,"" which bars banks from making risky trades with their own money and limits their investments in certain funds.""[36] The bill passed in the House on April 29, 2014 in a voice vote.[37]
In 2008, Barr married Eleanor Carol Leavell of Georgetown, Kentucky, who serves as the executive director of the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship.[1][2] They have two daughters, Eleanor, 3, and Mary Clay, 1.[38] The Barrs are members of the Christ Church Cathedral in Lexington.[1]"
"173","","2008","1965","Louisiana 1","Louisiana State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise","Steve Scalise","Republican","Current House Majority Whip
Louisiana State Senate, Louisiana House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","Stephen Joseph ""Steve"" Scalise (born October 6, 1965) is the current United States House of Representatives Majority Whip and representative for Louisiana's 1st congressional district, serving since 2008. He is a member of the Republican Party[1][2] and the chairman of the 170-member conservative House Republican Study Committee.[3]
Prior to his congressional tenure, Scalise served for four months in the Louisiana State Senate and twelve years in the Louisiana House of Representatives. On June 19, 2014, Scalise was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives. He assumed office on August 1. He is the first Louisianan in the Majority Whip's position since Democrat Hale Boggs of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district held the position from 1962 to 1971.


Scalise was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is the son of Alfred J. Scalise and Carol Schilleci Scalise.
Scalise graduated from Archbishop Rummel High School in Metairie in Jefferson Parish and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, with a major in computer programming and a minor in political science.[4]
Scalise was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1995, 1999, and 2003. He succeeded fellow Republican Representative Quentin D. Dastugue, who made an unsuccessful bid for governor in the 1995 primary.
His legislative peers named him to the House Appropriations Committee as the representative of the First Congressional District. Scalise opposed the 2002 Stelly Plan, a proposal by Lake Charles Representative Vic Stelly, since repealed, to reduce certain state sales taxes on food for home consumption and utilities in exchange for higher state income taxes.
Scalise was elected in the October 20, 2007, nonpartisan blanket primary to the District 9 seat in the Louisiana Senate vacated by the term-limited Ken Hollis of Metairie. Scalise received 19,154 votes (61 percent) in a three-way contest. Fellow Republican Polly Thomas polled 8,948 votes (29 percent). A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, Cameron Henry of Metairie.
In the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, Conrad Appel defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent). Thomas had also lost the race for the seat in 2007 to Scalise.[5]
On being asked by the New Orleans Times-Picayune to assign Democrat Barack Obama a letter grade for Obama's first 100 days as President, Scalise awarded the new president an L (for ""liberal"").[6]
Scalise encouraged residents throughout Southeast Louisiana to provide feedback about the Corps of Engineers' Category 5 proposal, titled Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) report.[7] In a June 5, 2009 letter to the editor of The Times-Picayune, Anne Milling, founder of the Women of the Storm wrote, ""Kudos to Rep. Steve Scalise, who led his congressional colleagues here last week for a first-hand glimpse of Louisiana's offshore oil and gas production and its critical importance to the nation.""[8]
In 2011, Scalise became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (withdrawn Jan 23, 2012).[9] As chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Scalise dismissed Derek Khanna, a committee staffer, in December 2012 because of pressure from content industry lobbyists after the study committee published a memo advocating copyright reform.[10]
In 2013, Scalise voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.[11] Also in 2013, Scalise sponsored a bill called the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. The bill makes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) consolidate several of their reports into one report.[12]
In the aftermath of Rep. Eric Cantor's unexpected defeat by David Brat on June 10, 2014, Scalise launched a campaign to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy in the position of Majority Whip of the House; McCarthy himself would replace Cantor as House Majority Leader. Scalise's ascent to leadership built on his ""come-from-behind win in 2012 to become chairman"" of the Republican Study Committee.[13] Scalise subsequently won a three-way race for whip, winning on the first ballot despite the efforts of fellow candidates Peter Roskam and Marlin Stutzman.[14][15] He came under fire for using the assistance of a federal lobbyist, John Feehery, when hiring staff for the Majority Leader's Press Office.[16]
Since becoming Majority Whip, Scalise has delivered several public defeats for the GOP on immigration, abortion, and education policy.[17]
In 2004, Scalise announced that he would run for the U.S. House but thereafter deferred to the preference of party leaders and supported Jindal, who won the position vacated by the successful U.S. senatorial candidate, David Vitter.
In 2007, when Jindal was elected to the governorship of Louisiana, Scalise announced his intentions to seek the seat yet again. This time he received Republican party backing.
Scalise's strongest Republican primary opponent, State Representative Timothy G. ""Tim"" Burns from Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish, accused Scalise of push polling, a practice in which a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of his opponent. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: ""We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll.""[18]
In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). He went on to win the runoff election on April 5 against Burns, who received 9,631 votes (28 percent) in the initial primary.[19][19][20]
In the May 3 general election, Scalise received 33,867 votes (75.13 percent) to Democrat Gilda Reed's 10,142 ballots (22.5 percent). Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.36 percent of the vote. Reed was a favorite of organized labor and the Democratic constituency groups. The First District has been Republican since 1977, when Bob Livingston won a special election.[21]
Scalise was sworn in on May 7, 2008.
In the regularly scheduled election, Scalise was reelected over Democrat Jim Harlan, 66 percent to 34 percent.
Scalise defeated the Democratic nominee, Myron Katz, and an Independent, Arden Wells, in his 2010 bid for reelection.
In June 2009, Scalise joined Dan Kyle, the former legislative auditor and the treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, as directors of a national presidential fund-raising effort promoting Governor Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hoped to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.[22] Others on the committee include former State Representative Woody Jenkins. Former Republican State Senator Tom Schedler of Slidell had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role at the time as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State Jay Dardenne.[22] In 2010, Schedler succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state.
In his own 2012 congressional race, Scalise prevailed with 193,490 votes (66.6 percent) over four opponents, the strongest of which was the Democrat M. V. ""Vinny"" Mendoza, who finished with 61,979 votes (21.3 percent). A second Republican, Gary King, received 24,838 votes (8.6 percent). Independent Arden Wells ran again and received 4,285 votes (1.5 percent) in his second race against Scalise.[23]
In 2014, political blogger[24][25] Lamar White, Jr. uncovered anonymous comments from 2002 on the white supremacist website Stormfront that referenced a speech Scalise had given, from which he concluded Scalise addressed the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a group founded by David Duke.[24][26][27][28][29][30] White posted his findings on his blog and soon after the media took note. Scalise said that he had spoken at the conference in 2002 and stated that he did not know of the ""racist nature of the group"".[25]
Various Louisiana politicians, including Republican Governor Bobby Jindal and Democratic Congressman Cedric Richmond defended Scalise's character.[31] Speaker of the House John Boehner voiced his continued confidence in Scalise as Majority Whip.[26][32] Several Democratic members of Congress, as well as Mo Elleithee, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, criticized Scalise, and challenged his statement that he was not aware of the group's affiliation with racism and anti-Semitism.[33] Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center called upon Scalise to step down from his leadership position as Majority Whip.[34][35] According to John Hayward at Human Events, the story of Scalise's speaking engagement in 2002 was ""either dubiously sourced, a mistake, or an outright hoax"".[36][37]
On December 29, Niels Lesniewski of Roll Call reprinted an article that had been run in 1999, after Congressman Bob Livingston had resigned from Congress. Duke and Scalise were considering running for his seat and they and others were interviewed for the piece. When asked about a potential bid for Congress by Duke, Scalise had told the newspaper that he held many of the same conservative views as Duke, but was a more electable candidate, saying that Duke's novelty had worn off.[38] Duke called Scalise a ""sellout"" for apologizing for speaking to the group and said that he might run against him in the 2016 elections because Scalise had been ""elected on false pretenses"" and had ""betrayed"" the voters by ""suggesting that they're racist because they supported my views"".[39][40][41]
He is a member of the American Italian Renaissance Foundation. He married the former Jennifer Ann Letulle (born 1975) on September 4, 2005.[42] The couple has two children.[43]"

His district includes most of New Orleans.


He was raised in Eastern New Orleans, going to public schools. Richmond's father died when he was seven years old. His mother was a public school teacher and small business owner. Richmond graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School, Morehouse College, Tulane School of Law and the Harvard University executive program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.[3]
He was the Louisiana State Representative for District 101 (Orleans Parish) from 2000 to 2011.[1] Having been first elected shortly after his 27th birthday, at the time he took office he became one of the youngest legislators ever to serve in Louisiana. He served as the Chairman of the Committee on Judiciary and a member of the Ways and Means, House Executive, and Legislative Audit Advisory committees.[4]
In an across-the-aisle gesture which was rare in Congress at the time, Richmond in 2014 defended his Republican colleague Vance McAllister, who had become embroiled in an alleged adultery scandal. Richmond associated the controversy with ""gotcha moments"" in which the ""two parties in this country have gone overboard...and taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents"".[5]
On June 9, 2014, Richmond introduced the Honor Flight Act (H.R. 4812; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a process for providing expedited and dignified passenger screening services for veterans traveling on an Honor Flight to visit war memorials built and dedicated to honor their service.[6]
Richmond came in third place in the seven-candidate primary election for the Democratic nomination for Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, behind U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson and television newscaster Helena Moreno. During a primary debate, Richmond attempted to discredit Moreno with accusations of drug use, while she attempted to attack his personal integrity by bringing up his disqualification from the 2005 New Orleans City Council ""D"" District election.[7] Later in 2008, Richmond's law license was suspended for 6 months by the State Supreme Court in a 52 decision after it was found that he falsified a sworn statement claiming greater than 2 years residency in New Orleans' ""D"" District in order to be eligible for the district's City Council position.[8]
Richmond challenged Republican incumbent Anh Joseph Cao for Louisiana's 2nd congressional district.
Richmond was the first candidate in the 2010 elections to have President Barack Obama appear in a television ad on his behalf.[9]
Most pundits reckoned Richmond as a heavy favorite to retake the seat for the Democrats, even in what was forecast to be a Republican year nationally. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+25, the 2nd was far and away the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The next most Democratic district on that list, Delaware's At-large congressional district, had a PVI of D+7. In 2008 Obama had carried the 2nd with a 74 percent of the vote, his fifth-best performance in a Southern district and his 35th best nationally.
Richmond won the November 2, 2010 election in the heavily Democratic majority-minority district with 65 percent of the vote.[10]

Charles William Boustany, Jr. (/bstni/; born February 21, 1956), is an American politician and physician who has served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district since 2013. He has served in Congress since 2005. The district, numbered as the 7th District from 2005 to 2013, is located in the southwestern portion of the state and includes Lafayette and Lake Charles. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Boustany was born in Lafayette, the son of Madlyn M. (ne Ackal) and Charles W. Boustany, Sr., M.D. (19302009); his paternal grandparents, Alfred Frem Boustany and the former Florida Saloom, were immigrants from Lebanon.[1] His maternal grandparents were also Lebanese.[2] In 2006, he was one of four Arab-American members of Congress.[3]
The senior Boustany, a Democrat, served for sixteen years as coroner of Lafayette Parish. Congressman Boustany has nine siblings: James Boustany, Jon Boustany, Ron Boustany, Dr. Stella Boustany Noel, Terese Reggie, Kathryn Scurlock, Madlyn Juneau, Adele Weber, and Cheryn Eppley.[4] He is also a cousin of Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of the late U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.[5]
Boustany, Jr., attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where he was a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He earned his medical degree from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. He is a retired cardiovascular surgeon, who completed his residency in Rochester, New York before returning to Louisiana to take a job at Charity Hospital in New Orleans.
In 2004, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Chris John of Louisiana's 7th congressional district decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. John had held the district for eight years without serious difficulty, even though it had been trending increasingly Republican at the national level. Boustany jumped into the race with another Republican, the late David Thibodaux of Lafayette, Democratic state senator Willie Mount of Lake Charles and Democratic state representative Don Cravins, Jr. of Opelousas. In the open primary election, Boustany ranked first with 39 percent, with Mount garnering 25 percent for second place.[6] Under Louisiana's nonpartisan blanket primary system, in the event no candidate wins a ""50 percent plus one vote"" total, a runoff is conducted between the two top candidates, regardless of party.
Vice President Dick Cheney campaigned on behalf of Boustany. In the December 4 run-off election, Boustany defeated Mount 55-45 percent.[7] He became only the second Republican to represent the district, the first having been Jimmy Hayes, who switched from Democratic affiliation in 1995.
Proving just how Republican this district had become, Boustany won re-election to a second term with 71 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Mike Stagg, despite the national tide that favored Democratic congressional nominees.[8]
Boustany won re-election to a third term defeating Cravins, now a state senator, 62-34 percent.[9]
Boustany won re-election to a fourth term unopposed.[10]
After Louisiana lost a district in redistricting, most of Boustany's territory became the 3rd District. He faced freshman fellow Republican and 3rd District incumbent Jeff Landry of New Iberia. Although the district was numerically Landry's district, it was geographically and demographically more Boustany's district. Indeed, the new 3rd contained almost two-thirds of Boustany's former territory, while Landry retained only the western third of his former district.
Endorsed by the interest group, Citizens United, Landry led Boustany in third-quarter 2011 fundraising, $251,000 to $218,000. According to Federal Election Commission, Boustany led in cash-on-hand lead, $1.1 million-$402,000.[11] In addition to Boustany and Landry, a third Republican, state Representative Chris Leopold of Plaquemines Parish, announced through Facebook his candidacy for the seat,[12] but he never filed.
The Boustany-Landry race attracted most of the political attention in Louisiana in 2012, as it was seen as pitting an establishment Republican against a candidate identifying with the Tea Party. Though most politicians shunned involvement in the heated race, but Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Michael G. Strain endorsed Boustany, who he described as particularly helpful to the agricultural sector while serving as a U.S. representative. Landry, meanwhile, carried the backing of most of the Republican parish executive committees in the district.[13] Landry also was endorsed by Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum political action committee.[14]
In the November 6 election, technically a nonpartisan blanket primary for Congress, Boustany led Landry by 45,596 votes. In a five-candidate field, Boustany received 139,123 votes (44.7 percent); Landry received 93,527 votes (30 percent). Democrat Ron Richard procured the critical 67,070 votes (21.5 percent). The remaining 7,908 votes (2.5 percent) and 3,765 ballots (1.2 percent) were cast, respectively, for Republican Bryan Barrilleaux and the Libertarian Jim Stark. Because no candidate received a majority, Boustany and Landry met in a runoff contest held on December 8.[15]
Boustany won the runoff election against Landry with 58,820 votes (60.90 percent). He had large margins in seven of the ten parishes in the district, particularly in Acadia, Calcasieu, and Lafayette but lost the three parishes that Landry represents, St. Martin, Iberia, and St. Mary.[16]
Boustany's plan for reinvigorating the economy of his district is known as the Prescription for Prosperity.[17]
Representative Boustany presented the Republican response to President Barack H. Obama's joint address to Congress on Wednesday September 9, 2009.
Boustany was the sponsor of H.R. 1173, the Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act of 2011. The bill would repeal title VIII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which established a voluntary long-term care insurance program. It passed the house 267-159 on February 1, 2012[18] but was never passed by the Senate.
In 2013, Boustany was a sponsor of the United States farm bill, where Representative showed support for the five-year, half-trillion-dollar farm bill. However, the bill was rejected 234-195 in votes, with sixty-two Republicans voting against.[19]
Boustany's wife, the former Bridget Edwards, is a daughter of the late Acadia Parish assistant district attorney Nolan Edwards (1930-1983) of Crowley and Eleanor Merrill of Longboat Key, Florida, who remarried after Nolan was shot to death in his law office by a disgruntled client.[20][21] Bridget Boustany is hence a paternal niece of Democratic former Governor Edwin Washington Edwards.[22]
Boustany purchased a bogus European title from fraudsters Achilleas Kallakis and Alex Williams. The fraud was uncovered, however, and Kallakis and Williams were convicted in 1995 of selling bogus titles to wealthy Americans.[23]
The Boustanys have two children, Erik Boustany and Ashley Joan Boustany Dugal[24]"

John Calvin Fleming, Jr. (born July 5, 1951) is an American politician, physician, and businessman who has served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 4th congressional district since 2009. Fleming, a member of the Republican Party, is from Minden, Louisiana. Second cousin (five generations removed) to the former Speaker of the House, Henry Clay, a member of Sons of the American Revolution and Jamestowne Society; Fleming is only the second Republican to hold his seat since Reconstruction.


Fleming was born in Meridian in Lauderdale County in eastern Mississippi. He grew up in a working class home in which his mother became disabled and could not work when he was still young. Just prior to his high school graduation, Fleming's father died of a heart attack, and he had to work his way through college. He attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford, MS, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. Fleming was awarded his Bachelor of Science degree in 1973. He went on to attend medical school at the same university, but at the Jackson, MS campus and received his M.D. degree in 1976.[2] He entered the United States Navy to continue his medical training in 1976 and served until 1982 after completing his residency in 1979. Fleming also trained for years in karate attaining the rank of third degree black belt.[3] Fleming and his wife, Cindy, married in 1978. The couple has four children.[4]
After earning his medical degree, Fleming was chief resident in family medicine at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Camp Pendleton, California. He also trained at the drug and alcohol treatment unit at the Navy Regional Medical Center in Long Beach, California.[4] Serving in the Navy after his residency, Fleming practiced family medicine on the island of Guam.[5] From 1979 to 1981, he was the director of drug and alcohol treatment and chairman of the Navy Family Advocacy Committee. He subsequently performed similar duties in Charleston, South Carolina.[4]
After leaving the Navy, Fleming established his practice in Minden in August 1982. His first clinic was on Pearl Street across from the United States Post Office. He chose Minden for his city of residence because, in his words, it ""has small-town charm, warm essence of life, long, lazy summer days with watermelon cuts and family reunions.""[6] To attract patients to his new practice, Fleming announced evening and Saturday morning hours to accommodate working people and students.[7]
Fleming received a certification from the American Board of Family Practice[4] and joined the staff of the Minden Medical Center.[8] Fleming also joined the Louisiana Academy of Family Physicians (LAFP). In 2007, he was chosen as the LAFP ""Louisiana Family Practice Physician of the Year.""[4]
Fleming previously worked with chemically dependent persons through the program called ""New Beginnings"" at the Minden Medical Center.[9] His book, Preventing Addiction: What Parents Must Know to Immunize Their Kids Against Drug And Alcohol Addiction was published in 2006.[10]
Fleming is a businessman who owns thirty-six Subway sandwich shops in North Louisiana[11][12] and Fleming Expansions, LLC, a regional developer for The UPS Store, with outlets in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.[11]
In 1987, Fleming entered the race for coroner of Webster Parish against the incumbent, the late Dr. Charles Hancock, but withdrew after learning the position would take too much time from his regular medical duties.[13]
In 1995, he ran for coroner again. He defeated the nonpartisan candidate, Dr. Carlos A. Irizarry, 7,842 votes and 60.6%, to 5,143 votes with 39.6%. Fleming succeeded Democratic incumbent Dr. Carl A. Hines, from Minden, who did not seek re-election.[12][14]
Fleming entered the race for the District 4 House seat after the 21-year incumbent Jim McCrery announced his retirement from the House. Fleming received political support from the LAFP and the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP) political action committee for his campaign.[15]
Fleming supported the FairTax,[11] which would replace the income tax with a flat rate on consumption, as defined in the legislation, of 23 percent of the total payment on personal consumption.[16]
The primary and subsequent runoff election were delayed because of Hurricane Gustav.[citation needed] In the October 4, 2008, Republican closed primary, Fleming ran against Jeff R. Thompson, a lawyer from Bossier City, and Chris Gorman.[citation needed] In the election, no candidate received a majority of the votes. Fleming led with 14,500 votes (35.1 percent), followed by Gorman with 14,072 votes (34.1 percent), and Thompson with 12,693 votes (30.8 percent).[17] This established a primary runoff between Fleming and Gorman which was held on November 4, along with the national presidential election.[citation needed]
In the runoff, Fleming defeated Gorman, 43,012 votes (55.6 percent) to 34,405 (44.4 percent) and carried all but one of the thirteen parishes in the district.[18]
In the 2006 race against McCrery, ""Catfish"" Kelley ran as a Republican and drew 12 percent of the vote under the old primary format.[19] In 2008, his 3 percent was far more than the margin between Fleming and Carmouche. A plurality is sufficient to win the general electionwhich, along with the District 2 race, were the last congressional races in the nation in 2008.[20]
Outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney appeared in Shreveport on November 21 to speak at a fundraiser for Fleming.[21] Politico.com indicated that McCrery supports Fleming but had made no official endorsement and had not appeared at any of Fleming's campaign events.[12] On December 2, McCrery spoke on Fleming's behalf in an appearance on The Moon Griffon Show radio program, which is syndicated in most Louisiana media markets. He used the argument that Carmouche, if successful, would cast his first vote for Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.[22]
On December 10, 2008, Paul Carmouche formally conceded the election to Fleming.[23]
Political consultant Lee Fletcher managed Fleming's campaign for Congress and served for the first few months in the term as Fleming's chief of staff.[citation needed] Fletcher died at the age of forty-three on September 30, 2009.[citation needed] He had been the chief of staff to U.S. Representative John Cooksey of Louisiana's 5th congressional district.[citation needed] In 2002, Fletcher lost the 5th District race to Rodney Alexander of Jackson Parish, then a Democrat who later became a Republican in August 2004.[citation needed]
Fleming was unopposed in the Republican primary in 2010 but was challenged by the Democratic nominee, David R. Melville, a United Methodist minister from Bossier City and the brother-in-law of former Governor Buddy Roemer.[citation needed] Artis Cash, a Shreveport community organizer, ran as an Independent in the general election.[citation needed] Buddy Roemer, then still a Republican and later a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, supported David Melville in the general election.[24]
Fleming was reelected with 62.3% of the vote. Melville received 32.4% of the popular vote, and Independent candidate Dr. Artis Cash, an African American minister, trailed with 5.3%.[citation needed] Fleming presented himself as an anti-Obama Republican who would work to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[citation needed] Fleming said that Democratic policies were out of step with his district and most of America.[25][26]
Fleming was unopposed by a Democratic candidate in his 2012 re-election bid in his district that is 2 to 1 Democratic registration but has a Cook PVI of R +11. In the November 6, 2012 general election, Fleming instead faced opposition from a Libertarian candidate, Randall Lord of Shreveport, a former chiropractor studying psychology at Louisiana State University in Shreveport.[27] Fleming defeated Lord, 187,790 (75.3 percent) to 61,587 (24.7 percent).[28]
On April 4, 2013, Fleming announced that he would not in 2014 seek the United States Senate held since 1997 by the Democratic Mary Landrieu. Instead his colleague, U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy of Baton Rouge, had announced on April 3 that he would challenge Landrieu. In his statement, Fleming said: ""For me to enter the race now would risk a contest between two experienced Republican congressmen, potentially offering Senator Landrieu a path back to Washington. I can't let that happen.""[29]
In August 2013, Fleming endorsed Republican State Senator Neil Riser of Columbia as his choice to succeed his retiring colleague Rodney Alexander of Jackson Parish in Louisiana's 5th congressional district. The special election to choose a successor to Alexander will be held on October 19.[30]
On December 10, 2014, KTBS, a Shreveport based television station, reported that Fleming was considering running for the senate seat currently held by David Vitter. Vitter, who is running in the 2015 Gubernatorial Election, would have to vacate his seat should he be elected Governor of Louisiana. In a statement, Fleming said ""If Senator Vitter is elected as Governor, I would certainly be interested in running for the seat he would vacate.""[31]
In a September 19, 2011 interview on MSNBC, in which Fleming criticized President Obama's proposed plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, Fleming told host Chris Jansing, ""The amount that I have to invest in my business and feed my family is more like $600,000 of that $6.3 million.... So by the time I feed my family I have, maybe, $400,000 left over to invest in new locations, upgrade my locations, buy more equipment."" When Jansing asked Fleming if he thought the ""average person"" might be unsympathetic to Fleming's position, Fleming responded, ""Class warfare never created a job...This is not about attacking people who make certain incomes. You know in this country, most people feel that being successful in their business is a virtue, not a vice, and once we begin to identify it as a vice, this country is going down.""[32]
Fleming's remarks were widely reported and resulted in considerable commentary. Bruce Alpert, of Louisiana newspaper The Times-Picayune, reported that ""on liberal blogs, Fleming was portrayed as insensitive to millions of working Americans who are struggling to meet expenses in the face of high unemployment and stagnant wages."" [32] Conservative sources including Bill O'Reilly and the Drudge Report defended Fleming's remarks; Josh Beavers, publisher of the Minden Press-Herald in Fleming's hometown, wrote an editorial which stated, ""[Fleming's] sentiment was only that the more taxes he pays the fewer people he can employ. High taxes on business owners thwart economic activity.""[32][33][34]
In 2013, Fleming was quoted in Forbes as saying:""Republicans in general, we desperately want a reduction in spending to get government back into balance. We would rather take some cuts in areas that we are not comfortable with than have no cuts at all.""[35] Forbes noted that Fleming's district includes Barksdale Air Force Base and Fort Polk, both major employers.[35] At a discussion in February 2013 in DeRidder, Fleming stated he would not vote to allow the government to cut $600 million from the defense plan.[36] Fleming voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011,[37] the act which caused the automatic budget sequestration in March 2013. In this November 21, 2011 statement Fleming criticized the Budget Control Act because of what he called ""devastating cuts to military spending."" [38]
In September 2013, Fleming cosponsored and introduced the Republican Study Committees American Health Care Reform Act, as an alternative to the soon-to-be-implemented Affordable Care Act, which Fleming said was not fixable or repairable. [39]
Also in September 2013, Fleming was among several conservative House Republicans who worked to defund and/or delay Obamacare in connection with government funding and debt ceiling legislation.[40]
In June 2013, Fleming sponsored an amendment to a Defense spending bill requiring the military to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, ""actions and speech"" reflecting the ""conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member."" The amendment drew objections from President Obama, who said ""commanders need discretion ""to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units."" The amendment was approved by the House Armed Services Committee, and a companion measure passed in the Senate.[41]
In July 2013, the U.S. House passed a measuresponsored by Flemingthat bars the Defense Department from appointing atheist chaplains. Fleming said """"The notion of an atheist chaplain is nonsensical; it's an oxymoron.""[41]

Ralph Lee Abraham (born September 16, 1954)[1] is an American physician and former veterinarian from Mangham, Louisiana, who won election on December 6, 2014, as a Republican to represent Louisiana's 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.[2] He defeated his Democratic opponent, Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe, by a margin of 134,612 votes (64.2 percent) to 75,004 (35.8 percent).[3]
Abraham has served in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary and the Mississippi National Guard. Abraham and his wife, Dianne, have three children. He is a graduate of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana State University School of Medicine.[4]
In his debate with opponent Mayo, Abraham recalled that he developed his medical practice ""from a little trailer. ... You should come to my practice in Mangham on a daily basis and I can show you the debacle of the Obamacare law ... As a practicing physician, right now, it's not working and it's even dangerous. ... When there is a wrong, we stand up and correct it. When we don't, we become just another socialist country. We've got to get back to fiscal responsibility.""[5]Mayo dismissed Abraham as a ""multimillionaire"" and endorsed the expansion of the Medicaid program to incorporate more of the working poor. Abraham replied, ""You would think if I've made millions of dollars from [Medicaid], then I would be for it. To expand Medicaid would take in 500,000-plus people. What the Obama administration won't tell you is that 260,000 of those would be moved from private insurance groups.""[5]
Regarding illegal immigration, Abraham said that he stands for ""No amnesty (and) seal the borders. For those illegals, 5 million-plus now, ... we don't know who they are, what they are, or who they represent. No amnesty, seal the border.""[5]
After his election, Abraham announced that Luke J. Letlow, his campaign manager, will become his chief of staff in January.[6]"

Chellie Pingree (born April 2, 1955) is an American politician.[2] She is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Maine's 1st congressional district since 2009. The district includes most of the southern part of the state, including Portland and Augusta.
Pingree was a member of the Maine Senate from 1992 to 2000, serving as majority leader from 1996 to 2000. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 2002, losing to Republican Susan Collins. From 2003 to 2006, she was President and CEO of Common Cause. She is the first Democratic woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine.


Pingree was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but has lived in Maine since she was a teenager. She attended the University of Southern Maine and graduated from College of the Atlantic with a degree in Human Ecology. Since graduating from College of the Atlantic, she has lived in North Haven, a small island community 12 miles off Rockland.
Pingree held various farming and care-taking jobs until 1981, when she started North Island Yarn, a cottage industry of hand knitters with a retail store on North Haven. Her business expanded and became North Island Designs, employing as many as ten workers. They began marketing knitting kits and pattern books nationwide through 1,200 retail stores and 100,000 mail order catalogues. Through North Island Designs, Pingree authored and produced five knitting books between 1986 and 1992. Eisenhower Fellowships selected Chellie Pingree as a USA Eisenhower Fellow in 1997.
As the leader of Common Cause, Pingree strengthened the organization's programs in media reform and elections, while maintaining programs in ethics and money in politics. Among the specific issues she championed at Common Cause are Net Neutrality; Mandatory Voter-Verified Paper Ballots; Public Financing of Congressional Elections; National Popular Vote (a work-around of the Electoral College), and an Independent Ethics Commission for Congress. She stepped down from Common Cause in February 2007 to return to her home state and run for Congress in 2008.[3]
Pingree was first elected in 1992 at the age of 37, defeating a popular Republican incumbent. She was outspoken against going to war against Iraq, although counseled by party insiders to avoid that subject. She won re-election in 1994[4] and 1996. In 2000, she was forced to leave the Legislature due to term limits.
Pingree served as the Senate Majority Leader in the Maine Senate representing Knox County. She was elected Maine's second female Senate Majority Leader on December 4, 1996.
During her tenure as a state legislator, Pingree led several economic development initiatives including landmark legislation to enhance small business opportunities and keep businesses in Maine. She gained nationwide headlines when she authored the nation's first bill regulating prescription drug prices, Maine Rx. Pingree also shepherded Maine's largest land-bill initiative, Land for Maine's Future.[5]
In 2002, Pingree made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican junior U.S. Senator Susan Collins. Collins, a popular moderate incumbent, won by a margin of 16%.[6]
In April 2007, Pingree filed papers for her bid to run for Maine's 1st congressional district.[7] On August 15, 2007, EMILY's List endorsed Pingree's campaign for Congress in Maine's 1st District.[8][9] In December 2007 she also received the endorsement of 21st Century Democrats.[10] She was endorsed by a number of labor organizations and many individuals and state officials, including Congressman Rush D. Holt, Jr.; Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky; Maine Senate Majority Leader Libby Mitchell; former Maine Senate Assistant Majority Leader Anne Rand; State Representative Paulette Beaudoin; State Representative Nancy Smith; progressive writer and activist Jim Hightower; the United Auto Workers; Planned Parenthood, and the League of Conservation Voters.[11]
The top contributors to Pingree's campaign were securities and investment industries, providing roughly $123,900 in funding. Key contributors include Paloma Partners, Caremi Partners, and the J Street PAC.
Pingree was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 4, 2008. She was sworn into Congress on January 6, 2009.[12]
In 2010, Pingree ran for reelection, and won, defeating Republican challenger Dean Scontras by a 57-43 margin. She overcame strong anti-Democrat and anti-incumbent political sentiment to become just one of eight Democrats in the House of Representatives to receive a higher percentage of the vote than in 2008.
On February 29, 2012, an Associated Press story mentioned that Pingree was starting to circulate petitions to run for the U.S. Senate seat that was vacated by the retirement of Olympia Snowe, which she confirmed on The Rachel Maddow Show later that night.[13] She withdrew her name from the race on March 7, indicating that she would run for re-election.[14]
Pingree is the most liberal member of the Maine delegation, and one of the most liberal legislators ever to represent Maine in Congress.[citation needed] Soon after her election, she joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which she is now vice-chairwoman.
In September 2010, a video surfaced on the internet showing Pingree disembarking in a private jet at Portland International Jetport owned by her then-fianc, hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman. This drew criticism because of past statements Pingree had made that were critical about legislators using private aircraft.[15][16][17] The House Ethics Committee, in a bipartisan letter, stated the travel was permissible under House ethics rules.[18]
Pingree announced on April 26, 2013 that she would not run for Governor of Maine in the 2014 election. She stated that she was ""happy"" to serve in the House, and that the possibility of a three-way race also factored into her decision.[19]
On May 23, 2013, Rep. Chellie Pingree introduced the York River Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2013 (H.R. 2197; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. If passed, the bill would require the National Park Service (NPS) to study a segment of the York River in the state of Maine for potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.[20] The study would be to determine how the proposed designation would affect current recreational and commercial activities.[21] The study would cost approximately $500,000.[22]
Congressional Progressive Caucus (Vice-Chair)
On her campaign website, Pingree lists supporting small business in Maine, holding banks and credit cards accountable for consumer protection, increasing Maine manufacturing jobs and preventing the overseas outsourcing of these jobs as key elements of her economic strategy.[23] Pingree's goals additionally include working towards health care reform, increasing women's rights and equality in the workplace, acquiring more sources of clean energy, and ending the war in Afghanistan.[23]
Pingree consistently receives high approval ratings from labor, pro-choice, and environmental interest groups.[24] In 2010, Pingree received a rating of 100% from the AFL-CIO, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the League of Conservation Voters.[24] Pingree typically receives moderate to low approval ratings from socially and economically conservative groups such as the American Family Association and Citizens Against Government Waste, who in 2009 gave Pingree ratings of 0% and 1% respectively. In 2010 the American political magazine National Journal gave Pingree a Composite Conservative rating of 9%, and a Composite Liberal rating of 92%.[24]
Pingree helped draft the Fair Elections Now Act, a proposal to provide public 'Fair Elections' funding for popular candidates who raised a sufficient number of small local contributions.[25] Pingree has spoken out against the 2011 Supreme Court ruling McComish v. Bennett, which limited public financing systems for congressional candidate campaigns. The representative favors a campaign finance system that provides increased opportunities for candidates who lack the benefits of private interest and independent expenditure committee funding.[25]
Pingree has consistently voted against resolutions promoting aggressive foreign policy.[26] Pingree voted ""yea"" in March 2011 on a resolution to remove forces from Afghanistan. In June 2011, Pingree voted ""yea"" on House Resolution 292, preventing President Barack Obama from deploying ground forces in Libya.[26]
Pingree has three children; the oldest, Hannah Pingree, is the Ex-Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
On June 18, 2011, Pingree married S. Donald Sussman, a hedge fund manager,[19] in a private ceremony at the couple's home in North Haven, Maine. Pingree met Sussman in 2007 and the two became engaged in 2008.[30] Sussman owns a 5% stake in MaineToday Media, the owners of the Portland Press Herald, Kennebec Journal, and Morning Sentinel, in addition to sitting on the board of directors. [31] Articles in those papers that discuss Pingree carry a disclaimer noting her marriage to Sussman. [19][32]
Congresswoman Pingree is co-owner of the Nebo Lodge Inn & Restaurant on Maine's North Haven Island.[33]"
"180","","2015","1953","Maine 2","Harvard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Poliquin","Bruce Poliquin","Republican","Maine State Treasurer","Roman Catholic","Bruce Lee Poliquin (born November 1, 1953) is a Maine Republican politician and investor. He is currently a member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Maine's 2nd congressional district. From 2011 to 2013, he was the State Treasurer of Maine.[2] He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 2012, finishing second in the primary election.
Poliquin was elected to his seat in the 2014 general election.[3]


Poliquin was born and raised in Waterville, Maine. He grew up in a family of French-Canadian ancestry, where his father was a school principal and his mother was a nurse [1]. He received a scholarship to attend Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and later attended Harvard University, where he studied economics, graduating in 1976. After leaving Harvard, Poliquin entered private business, including a position with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.[2] In 1989, he married Jane Carpenter, whom he had known in Waterville, but she died in a swimming accident three years later. He has one son. Poliquin remarried in 2003, and was divorced in 2009.
In 2010, Poliquin sought the Maine Republican Party's nomination for Governor of Maine. He spent $711,000 of his own money and over $798,000 in total, but finished sixth of the seven candidates behind winner Paul LePage. After his unsuccessful bid, Poliquin campaigned strongly for LePage, calling him a true fiscal conservative.[4] Following the election of Republican Paul LePage in November 2010, Poliquin was elected by the state legislature to serve as state Treasurer.[4]
In the fall 2011, Poliquin criticized the Maine State Housing Authority for its plans to underwrite federal tax credits to redevelop an historic property in Portland's West End, 68 High Street. The vacant lot at 66 High Street and 68 High Street were planned to turn into Elm Terrace, a low-income facility with 38 units. Poliquin criticized the proposed unit price of $314,000. Dale McCormick, the authority's director and an appointee by Democratic Governor John Baldacci, approved the proposal following a reduction in the per unit price to $265,000. McCormick noted that the average per unit cost in the West End was approximately $220,000 and the building had to be rebuilt to include elevators and other code requirements, while Poliquin argued that it was better and more cost effective to place low income housing on the outskirts of towns and cities.[5]
In February of 2012, Poliquin faced criticism from Democrats over allegations that he conducted commerce while serving as State Treasurer, which would have been a violation of Article V, Part 3 of the Maine Constitution. One allegation involved his ownership of the Popham Beach Club, a private club in Phippsburg, where he appeared before the Planning Board in a matter involving the club. A second alleged instance of commerce involved his real estate company Dirigo Holdings LLC. Maine Attorney General William Schneider advised Poliquin to disassociate himself from his business ventures but did not offer an opinion as to whether he had actually violated the Constitution. The Maine Legislature, after pressure from Democrats, voted 122-0 to send the matter to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court for review, but the Court declined to do so. [6] [7]
In February of 2012 Poliquin faced criticism from the left over his use of the Tree Growth Tax Program, a program meant to preserve forestland from development pressures for commercial timber harvesting, with 10 acres of his oceanfront property in Georgetown. The program reduced the value of his property from the originally assessed $1.8 million to $725,500, resulting in Poliquin paying $30 a year in property taxes on the otherwise valuable land.[8] A Maine Forest Service report in 2009 discussed Poliquin's property as an example of a property that may not be fully complying with the law, stating that restrictions on timber harvesting in shoreland areas would limit any commercial use of the land. They did state, however, that as long as the property was 10 acres, it could remain in the program. [9]
Poliquin later transferred the property in question to the Open Space program, a less generous tax abatement program. The Georgetown Board of Selectmen unanimously approved the transfer, and declined to pursue penalties for removing the property from Tree Growth. Poliquin denied that he took his actions due to any alleged improper use of the Tree Growth program, and stated that the issue was a distraction for Georgetown and was politically motivated due to Democrats' dissatisfaction with his policies as Treasurer.[8]
At the end of his term, Poliquin wrote an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News with a list of his offices' accomplishments as Treasurer. These included reforms to the state workers' pension plan, efforts to reduce the cost of affordable housing, reduced wasteful spending, and retention of the state's Aa2 bond rating, among other initiatives. [10]
In March 2012, Poliquin announced he would be running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe.[11] He lost the Republican primary to Charlie Summers, who himself lost to Independent former Gov. Angus King.
Poliquin stated on July 10, 2013 that he was not interested in becoming the Chairman of the Maine Republican Party, despite encouragement to do so from many Republicans, including Gov. LePage. [12]
In August 2013, Poliquin announced that he would seek the Maine Republican Party's nomination for the Second Congressional District.[13][14]
Poliquin won the primary election against former Maine Senate President Kevin Raye and faced Democratic State Senator Emily Cain and unenrolled retired Navy captain Blaine Richardson in the general election.[3] Poliquin was declared winner and took office January 3, 2015.
One of Rep. Poliquin's first votes in Congress was to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Full Disclosure Act of 2015, an anti-abortion measure. He stated he did so because ""I dont believe requiring taxpayers to fund abortions reflects the values of our 2nd District families"".[15]
On February 3, 2015, Poliquin was one of three House Republicans to vote against repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.[16] His spokesman stated that while Poliquin supports repeal, the proposed bill did not offer a ""free market alternative"" to immediately take its place, which he feels is needed.[17] Poliquin was subsequently criticized by conservative groups seeking immediate repeal of the law, including the Republican Liberty Caucus which voted on February 5, 2015 to rescind their election endorsement of him. Poliquin responded by noting the House has voted numerous times to repeal the law without effect, and that ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.""[18]"

Andy Harris (born January 25, 1957) is an American politician and physician who has been the U.S. Representative for Maryland's 1st congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party and is currently the only Republican member of Marylands congressional delegation; he previously served in the Senate of the Maryland General Assembly.


Harriss father was Zoltn Harris, an anesthesiologist who was born in Miskolc, Hungary, in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in Poland.[3]
Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from The Johns Hopkins University. The Universitys Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in Health Policy & Management and also Health Finance & Management.[3]
Harris served in the Navy Medical Corps and the U.S. Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander on active duty during Operation Desert Storm and currently serves as a commander.[3] He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.[3]
Harris was first elected to the Maryland Senate in 1998 for District 9 for Baltimore County.[4] He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader F. Vernon Boozer, in the 1998 primary election.[5] A major factor in the race was Boozers role in derailing an attempt to ban partial-birth abortion a year earlier; the bills sponsor, fellow state senator Larry Haines, supported Harriss primary bid.[6] In the general election he defeated Democrat challenger Anthony O. Blades.
His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing [Baltimore County and Harford County. He defeated Democratic challenger Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002,[7] and from 2003 to 2006 served as the minority whip.[3] In 2006 he won re-election, this time defeating Patricia A. Foerster.[8]
Harris defeated incumbent Republican Wayne Gilchrest and State Senator E.J. Pipkin in the Republican primary for Maryland's 1st congressional district.[9] Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrests decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth,[10] which raised nearly $250,000 for him,[11] and by former governor Bob Ehrlich,[12] seven of 10 state senators who represent parts of the district, and House Minority Leader Anthony O'Donnell.[13] His general election opponent Frank Kratovil attacked the Club for Growth's policies, and Harris for having its support.[14] Gilchrest endorsed Kratovil for the general election.[15]
The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the districts geography. Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the Eastern Shore, which is home to half the districts population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting absentee ballots, Kratovils lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.[16][17] Harris finally conceded on November 11. While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. John McCain won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.
Harriss primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the November 2 general election, the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.
The National Journals Cook Political Report named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could redraw Harriss home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.[18] Instead, Roscoe Bartlett's district was redrawn so as to beat him.[19] Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included several heavily Republican portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartletts 6th district.
Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger Wendy Rosen with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with information about election-law violations. By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosens replacement, but could only be a write-in.
Harris defeated Democrat John LaFerla in the 2014 congressional elections for Maryland's 1st district.
Harris has not yet announced a 2016 congressional bid. He is widely expected to run for re-election in his seat. He is expected to face opposition in a Republican primary from former Maryland delegate Mike Smigiel.[20]
Harriss prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the 2010 health care legislation. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the Federal employee health benefit plan would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. This is the only employer Ive ever worked for where you dont get coverage the first day you are employed, he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.[21][22] Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a demand for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.[23] Furthermore, Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap, added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harriss request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to socialized medicine.[24]
On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.[25]
In 2014 Harris led the charge to block a recently adopted Washington D.C. cannabis decriminalization bill.[26] His amendment led to a call from D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Rep. Harris's district and the boycott of Maryland's 1st District,[27] as well as an online campaign requesting that D.C. area businesses refuse him service at their establishments.[28] In November 2014, D.C. residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis for adults with 68% in favor.[29] Despite this, Harris said he would use ""all resources available to a member of Congress to stop this action"".[30] On December 9, 2014, congressional leaders announced a deal on a spending bill that included language that will prohibit the D.C. referendum from taking effect. Harris noted that ""the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district.""[31] Harris believes that cannabis is a gateway drug[32] and has no proven medicinal use.[33] Harris may face a 2016 Republican primary challenge based in part on his opposition to the District's marijuana law. [34]
Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, ""a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis,"" which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.[35]
Harris was married for 30 years to Sylvia Cookie Harris, who died suddenly on August 28, 2014 after a bout with a prolonged unknown illness.[40] He and Mrs. Harris have five children. Harris resides in Cockeysville, Maryland, and considers himself a citizen-legislator, maintaining his medical practice while in the State Senate.[3]
Andy Harris has been an active member in the community as a member of the Knights of Columbus,[41] an officer in the Thornleigh Neighborhood Improvement Association (vice-president, 198485; president, 198586),[citation needed] a member of the Board of Directors of the Sherwood Community Association, 198791,[citation needed] and served as Vice President of St. Joseph's School Home-School Association from 1992 to 1994.[citation needed] Also, he has been on the Board of Directors of the Maryland Leadership Council, 199598, a member of the North Central Republican Club (treasurer, 199798; vice-president, 1998),[3] and finally as a Delegate to the Republican Party National Convention, 2004.[41] Harris has received the Dr. Henry P. and M. Page Laughlin Distinguished Public Officer Award from the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland in 2001.[41]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party and served as Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015.
The district covers parts of Baltimore County, Anne Arundel County, Harford County, Howard County and Baltimore City.


Ruppersberger was born in Baltimore, the son of Margaret ""Peggy"" (ne Wilson) and Charles Albert ""Al"" Ruppersberger, Jr. He is of part German descent.[1] Ruppersberger's legal first name is Dutch,[citation needed] a nickname since childhood. He graduated from Baltimore City College and attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he played lacrosse. He earned his juris doctor (JD) from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Ruppersberger began his career as a Baltimore County Assistant State's Attorney. He was soon promoted to the Chief of the State's Attorney Office Investigative Division, pursuing organized crime, political corruption, and drug trafficking. He was elected to the Baltimore County Council in 1985 and again in 1989, chosen twice as council chairman. In December 1994 and again in 1998, Ruppersberger was elected Baltimore County Executive.
Ruppersberger was the first Democratic freshman ever to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. He was named to this committee because his district is home to the National Security Agency. From January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2015, he served as this committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite Gang of Eight, which refers to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.
Congressman Ruppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car accident while investigating a drug trafficking case. Thanks to the dedication of doctors at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, Congressman Ruppersberger survived and began campaigning for office to assist Shock Trauma after they saved his life. He remains an active supporter of the hospital, serving as vice chairman of its board of visitors. He also serves on the United States Naval Academy Board of Visitors.
In one of his first acts in Washington in 2003, Congressman Ruppersberger created the national Hero Miles program to enable patriotic Americans to donate their frequent flyer miles to wounded warriors recovering at military or Veterans Administration (VA) medical centers as well as to friends and family visiting them. In 2012, he authored legislation expanding the program to enable Americans to also donate their hotel reward points to military families. Both the Hero Miles and Hotels for Heroes programs are administered by Fisher House, a nonprofit organization that opens its homes to military families visiting their injured loved ones at hospitals across the country .[2] He won a Charles Dick Medal of Merit in 2004 for this initiative, thus becoming the last Marylander to win this award, which was previously awarded to U.S. Rep. Beverly Byron (1992), State Senator John Astle (1993), U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski (1994), U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (1998) and State Del (now State Comptroller) Peter Franchot (1999).
Congressman Ruppersberger, along with Michigan Republican Mike Rogers, co-sponsored the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, designed to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies.[3] More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T, IBM and Intel.[4] Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act for a lack of civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, and thereby creates a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.[5] CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012.[6] It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18, 2013, by a bipartisan vote of 288-127. Ninety-two Democrats supported the bill, many citing significant privacy improvements over the 2012 version. [7]
Barred from a third term as County Executive, Ruppersberger opted to run for Congress in 2002 after 2nd District Congressman Bob Ehrlich made what turned out to be a successful run for governor. The Maryland General Assembly significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of Harford County to the 1st and 6th Districts. In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st District. This turned the 2nd from a swing district into a strongly Democratic district. It was an open secret that the district was drawn for Ruppersberger; local media called the new district ""the Dutch district."" An August 2011 editorial by The Washington Post describes the 2nd district as ""curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land"" and ""a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep. (and later Gov.) Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, and installing C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat who still holds the job.""[8] He defeated Republican opponent Helen Delich Bentley, who had represented the 2nd district from 1985 to 1995, with 55 percent of the vote. Ruppersberger has never faced another contest even that close and has been reelected five times. On April 10, 2013, the Baltimore Sun reported that Ruppersberger was considering a run for governor of Maryland in 2014.[9] In January of 2014, Ruppersberger announced that he would not run for Governor, but instead would seek reelection to the House of Representatives.[10]
Ruppersberger married his high school sweetheart in 1971 and has two grown children, Cory and Jill, and three grandchildren.[11]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes the state capital of Annapolis, central portions of the city of Baltimore, and parts of Anne Arundel, Howard, Montgomery and Baltimore counties.


John Sarbanes is the eldest son of former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes (who represented the 3rd from 1971 to 1977) and Christine Dunbar Sarbanes, a teacher. He was born in Baltimore, having Greek origin on his father's side and English on his mother's,[2] and graduated from the Gilman School there in 1980.[3] He received a B.A., cum laude, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1984 and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School, where he was co-chair of the Law School Democrats, in 1988.[3]
After college, Sarbanes clerked with Baltimore Judge J. Frederick Motz on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.[4] Sarbanes spent his professional legal career at the law firm of Venable LLP in Baltimore from 1989 to 2006, where he was chair of health care practice from 2000 to 2006 and a member of the hiring committee from 1992 to 1996.[3]
Congressman Sarbanes has introduced H.R. 2054, the No Child Left Inside Act (NCLI). This Act seeks to both improve education in the nations public schools and to protect the environment by creating a new environmental education grant program, providing teacher training for environmental education, and including environmental education as an authorized activity under the Fund for the Improvement of Education.[5] NCLI also requires states that participate in the environmental education grant programs to develop a plan to ensure that high school graduates are environmentally literate. This legislation is supported by a coalition of over 1200 local, regional, and national organizations representing millions of concerned citizens who are anxious to see a new commitment to environmental education.[5]
Sarbanes sought the Democratic nomination for Maryland's 3rd congressional district after 10-term incumbent Ben Cardin gave up the seat to run for the Senate seat of John Sarbanes' father, Paul Sarbanes. The primary campaign included State Senator Paula Hollinger, former Baltimore City Health Commissioner Peter Beilenson, and former Maryland Democratic Party Treasurer Oz Bengur. Sarbanes won the nomination on September 12, 2006 with 31.9% of the vote. His Republican opponent in the general election was Annapolis marketing executive John White. However, the 3rd is a heavily Democratic district that has been in that party's hands since 1927, and few expected Sarbanes to have much difficulty in the election. Sarbanes also benefited from name recognition; his father represented the district from 1971 to 1977. On November 7, 2006, Sarbanes won the general election with 64% of the vote, while White received 34% of the vote and Libertarian Charles Curtis McPeek received 2%. He has been reelected four times with no substantive opposition.
In the 2008 election cycle, the Sarbanes campaigns income totaled $1,012,936 and his campaign spent $799,506.[6] His top individual contributor was Veneble LLP ($38, 854),[6] which is where he spent his professional legal career for 18 years (19892006), represent[ing] non-profit hospitals and senior living providers in their mission to deliver high quality care to the people of Maryland. [5] Other top contributors included Johns Hopkins University, Gordon Feinblatt et al., Chesapeake Partners Management, DLA Piper, and the Carpenters & Joiners Union.[6] The top sectors that contributed money to his campaign were Finance/Insurance/Real Estate, Lawyers & Lobbyists, Labor, and Health.[6] The top industries that contributed to Sarbanes campaign include: Lawyers, Real Estate, Education, and Health Professionals.[6]
Sarbanes lives in Towson, Maryland with his three children and wife Dina, whom he met at Harvard and married in 1988.[4][7]"

Edwards (born June 28, 1958) is the U.S. Representative for Maryland's 4th congressional district, serving since a special election in 2008. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes most of Prince George's County, as well as part of Anne Arundel County.
A lawyer and longtime community activist, she defeated 15-year incumbent Albert Wynn in the 2008 Democratic primary,[1] and, following his resignation, won a special election on June 17, 2008, to fill the remainder of this term.[2] She was sworn in two days later on June 19, becoming the first African-American woman to represent Maryland in the United States Congress.[3] Edwards ran for a full term in November 2008, defeating Republican candidate Peter James with 85% of the vote.[4]
She sponsored an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would repeal the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.[5]


Edwards earned B.A. degrees in English and Spanish from Wake Forest University, where she was one of only six black women in her class.[6] After working for Lockheed Corporation at the Goddard Space Flight Center with the Spacelab program[citation needed], she attended and earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire School of Law (formerly the Franklin Pierce Law Center). Edwards worked for Albert Wynn as a clerk in the 1980s, when he served in the Maryland House of Delegates.
Edwards co-founded and served as the first executive director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an advocacy and legal support group for battered women. She worked to pass the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
She later worked with Public Citizen, and then as the executive director of the Center for a New Democracy. In 2000 she became the executive director of the Arca Foundation, taking a leave of absence during her political campaign.
On April 27, 2009, Rep. Donna Edwards was arrested outside the Sudan embassy during a protest against genocide in Darfur.[7] The Representative and five other US Congressional Representatives were protesting the blocking of aid to victims. They were arrested after ignoring warnings issued by police maintaining a police line to protect the embassy in Washington D.C.
The other U.S. lawmakers arrested during the protest were Reps. Jim McGovern (D-Massachusetts), Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota), Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia), Rep. Jim Moran (D-Virginia), and Lynn Woolsey (D-California).[8]
Edwards challenged seven-term incumbent Al Wynn in the 2006 Democratic primary - the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. Edwards focused primarily on Wynn's voting record. Wynn, considered a conservative by African-American Democratic standards, was one of four Congressional Black Caucus members that voted for the 2002 Iraq War resolution. Edwards condemned the war before it started. Wynn eventually began to say he was misled by the Bush Administration and his vote was a mistake. Edwards opposed the repeal of the estate tax, which Wynn voted for. Similarly, Edwards criticized Wynn's vote for the bankruptcy bill of 2005, which eliminated some bankruptcy protections for individuals. Wynn supported the energy bill promoted by Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney. Wynn opposed the net neutrality bill of 2006, which Edwards supports.
On August 16, 2006, before a debate at Prince George's Community College, an altercation occurred between Wynn's staffers and an Edwards volunteer, leaving the volunteer with a bloody gash to the head.[10] This event brought much media attention to the race.
On August 30, 2006, the Washington Post endorsed Edwards in the primary race.[11]
The primary was held on September 12, 2006. Wynn defeated Edwards by 49.7 percent to 46.4 percent, with a margin of 2,725 votes out of more than 82,000 cast. George McDermott, a little-known candidate, took 3.9 percent.[12] The final tally of the primary was unclear for nearly two weeks because of widespread voting problems on new electronic voting machines in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.[13]
In 2008, Edwards again challenged Wynn for his seat in the Democratic primary. During the 2008 campaign, Edwards accused Wynn of being out of touch with the community and of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of corporate money. Wynn counter-attacked Edwards as hypocritical, citing the fact that she served as executive director of the Arca Foundation, an organization that has invested millions of dollars in oil and gas companies.[14]
In the February 12, 2008, primary, Edwards defeated the eight-term incumbent in a rout, taking 60% of the vote to Wynn's 35%. The win virtually assured her of victory in the heavily Democratic district in November.[15]
After the primary, Wynn announced he would retire effective June 2008. Edwards won the Democratic nomination for the June 17, 2008, special election to serve out the last six months of Wynn's term.[16]
Edwards won the backing of the Montgomery County, Maryland, Democratic Party Central Committee April 22, 2008, by a 22 to 1 margin. Two days later, the Prince George's County Democratic Party Central Committee also recommended Edwards, this by a 17 to 0 vote on April 24, 2008.
As expected, Edwards easily won the special election, taking 81 percent of the vote over Republican Peter James and Libertarian Thibeaux Lincecum.[17] She took office two days later, giving her a leg-up on seniority over any new congresspersons who were elected in 2008.
Edwards ran for a full term in November 2008 and was an overwhelming favorite; a Republican has never tallied more than 25 percent of the vote in the 4th district since it assumed its current configuration after the 1990 Census.[18] Indeed, many of the 4th district's residents already thought of her as the district's congresswoman even before the special election.[2] As expected, Edwards easily won a full term with 85 percent of the vote, one of the highest percentages in the nation for a Democrat facing major-party opposition.[4]
Edwards won against Delegate Herman L. Taylor, Jr. in the September, 2010, primary.
On March 10, 2015, Edwards announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Barbara Mikulski (D) setting up a primary against Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).[19]
Edwards lives in Fort Washington, Maryland."

President of the Maryland State Senate, Maryland Board of Higher Education","Baptist - Alliance of Baptists","Steny Hamilton Hoyer (/stni h.r/; born June 14, 1939) is the U.S. Representative for Maryland's 5th congressional district, serving since 1981. The district includes a large swath of rural and suburban territory southeast of Washington, D.C.. He is a member of the Democratic Party.
He was first elected in a special election on 19 May 1981 and served as the House Majority Leader from 2007 to 2011.[1][2] He had previously served as House Minority Whip from 2003 to 2007, and was reelected to that post in 2011. These positions make him the second-ranking figure in the House Democratic Leadership hierarchy.


Hoyer was born in New York City, New York, and grew up in Mitchellville, Maryland, the son of Jean (ne Baldwin) and Steen Theilgaard Hyer. His father was Danish and a native of Copenhagen; ""Steny"" is a variant of his father's name, ""Steen"",[3] and Hoyer is an anglicized form of the fairly common Danish surname ""Hyer"". His mother was an American with Scottish, German, and English ancestry and a descendant of John Hart, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.[4] He graduated from Suitland High School in Suitland, Maryland.
In 1963, he graduated magna cum laude from the University of Maryland, College Park, where he also became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.[5] He earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., in 1966.[5]
For four years, from 1962 to 1966, Hoyer was a member of the staff of United States Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland); also on Senator Brewster's staff at that time was Nancy Pelosi, who would later become a leadership colleague of Hoyer as she served as Minority Leader and Speaker of the House.[6]
In 1966, Hoyer won a seat in the Maryland State Senate, representing Prince George's County-based 26th Senate District.[5][7] In 1975, Hoyer was elected President of the Maryland State Senate, the youngest in state history.[8]
In 1978, Hoyer sought the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Maryland but lost out to Samuel Bogley 37%-34%.[9] In the same year, Hoyer was appointed to the Maryland Board of Higher Education, a position he served in until 1981.[5]
Fifth District Congresswoman Gladys Spellman fell into a coma three days before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes. He then defeated a better funded Republican, Audrey Scott, in the May 19 special election by 56%-44%, earning himself the nickname of ""boy wonder"".[10][11][12] In the 1982 general election, Hoyer won re-election to his first full term with 80% of the vote.[13] He has only faced one relatively close contest since then, when he defeated future Governor of Maryland Lawrence Hogan, Jr. with just 55% of the vote in 1992.[14] His second worst performance was his 1996 bid against Republican State Delegate John Morgan, when he won re-election with 57% of the vote.[15]
On February 28, 2014, Hoyer introduced the bill To amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act to extend the termination date (H.R. 4120; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives.[30] The bill would extend until November 9, 2016, the authority of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to construct a museum on federal lands within the District of Columbia honoring law enforcement officers.[31]
Hoyer is a prolific fundraiser for House Democrats. He has been the top giver to fellow party members in the House. In the 2008 election cycle, he contributed more than $1 million to the party and individual candidates as of July 14, 2008.[32]
In March 2007, the Center for Public Integrity reported that Hoyer's political action committee ""raised nearly $1 million for congressional candidates [in the 2006 election cycle] by exploiting what experts call a legal loophole."" The Center reported the following:
Campaign finance disclosure records show that the Maryland Democrat used his leadership political action committee  AmeriPAC  as a conduit to collect bundles of checks from individuals, and from business and union interests. He then passed more than $960,000 along to 53 House candidates and another quarter of a million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics Web site show. Federal law generally prohibits political action committees, including leadership PACs, which are run by politicians, from receiving more than $5,000 each year from a single donor or giving more than $10,000 to a single candidate ($5,000 each for the primary and the general election). But Hoyer collected as much as $136,000 from one labor union committee and distributed more than $86,000 to a single Congressional race.[33]
The only media to cover the report, the Capital News Service, quickly pointed out how common and legal the practice is:
""That's like saying somebody who deducts mortgage interest on their taxes is exploiting a tax loophole,"" said Nathaniel Persily, a campaign finance expert and University of Pennsylvania Law School professor. ""What exactly is the problem?""
""Bundling is very common,"" said Steve Weisman, of the George Washington University's Campaign Finance Institute.
Fifth District Congresswoman Gladys Spellman fell into a coma three days before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes. He then defeated a better funded Republican candidate in the May 19 special election, earning himself the nickname of ""boy wonder"".[10] He won the seat for a full term in 1982 and has been reelected 14 times with no substantive opposition, and is the longest-serving House member from southern Maryland ever.[8]
Hoyer has served as chair of the Democratic Caucus, the fourth-ranking position among House of Representatives Democrats, from 1989 to 1994; the former co-chair (and a current member) of the Democratic Steering Committee; and as the chief candidate recruiter for House Democrats from 1995 to 2000. He also served as Deputy Majority Whip from 1987 to 1989.[5]
When David E. Bonior resigned as Minority Whip in early 2002, Hoyer ran but lost to Nancy Pelosi. After the 2002 midterm elections, Pelosi ran to succeed Dick Gephardt as Minority Leader, leaving the Minority Whip post open again.[35] On November 14, 2002, Hoyer was unanimously elected by his colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to serve as the Minority Whip, the second-highest-ranking position among House Democrats.[8]
Pelosi became the Speaker of the House in January 2007. Hoyer was elected by his colleagues to be House Majority Leader for the 110th Congress, defeating John Murtha of Pennsylvania by a vote of 149-86 within the caucus, despite Pelosi endorsing Murtha.[1][36] Hoyer is the first Marylander to become Majority Leader.[37] and became the highest-ranking federal lawmaker in Maryland history.[8] In this post, Hoyer was the floor leader of the House Democrats and ranked second in the leadership after the Speaker who is the actual head of the majority party in the house.
The day after the 2010 midterms elections in which the Democrats lost control of the House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and stated that he would not challenge her bid for Minority Leader (for Pelosi to remain Democratic House Leader).[38] He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (the top House Democrats want to remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer's would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for re-election.[39][40][41] The Congressional Black Caucus backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer, and Hoyer has also raised money and campaigned for many candidates.[42][43] Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard L. Berman, Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, and outgoing Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman[44] Pelosi intervened in the contest by supporting Hoyer as Minority Whip, while creating an ""Assistant Leader"" position for Clyburn which would keep him as the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind Pelosi and Hoyer (the existing ""Assistant to the Leader"" post currently held by Chris Van Hollen is not officially part of the House leadership and was directly appointed by the Minority Leader).[45][46]
Hoyer has three daughters from his marriage to Judy Pickett Hoyer, who died in 1997. In 2012, after Hoyer announced his support of same-sex marriage, his daughter Stefany Hoyer Hemmer came out as a lesbian in an interview with the Washington Blade.[50]
His wife was an advocate of early childhood education, and child development learning centers in Maryland have been named in her honor (""Judy Centers"").[51] She also suffered from epilepsy, and the Epilepsy Foundation of America sponsors an annual public lecture in her name.[52] Hoyer, too, has been an advocate for research in this area, and the Epilepsy Foundation presented him in 2002 with their Congressional Leadership Award.[53]
Hoyer serves on the Board of Trustees for St. Mary's College of Maryland[5] and is a member of the board of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a nonprofit that supports international elections.[54] He is also an Advisory Board Member for the Center for the Study of Democracy"

Delaney (born April 16, 1963) is an American politician and businessman who has been the United States Representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district since 2013.[3][4] The district, the state's second-largest, includes the entire western portion of the state, but the bulk of its vote is cast in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Delaney grew up in New Jersey, where his father worked as an electrician. Scholarships helped him attend college thanks to his fathers labor union (IBEW Local 164) as well as the American Legion, VFW, and the Lions Club. He is a graduate of Columbia University and Georgetown University Law Center.[5][6] In February 2015, Delaney received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland.[7]
Delaney founded two New York Stock Exchange-listed companies before the age of 40 and won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. In 1993, he co-founded Health Care Financial Partners, to make available loans to smaller health care service providers ignored by larger banks.[8] HCFP grew rapidly, became public in 1996, and became an NYSE company in 1998.[9] In 2000, Delaney co-founded CapitalSource, a commercial lender headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. CapitalSource is also publicly traded on the NYSE.[10]
He was a member of the Board of Directors of several organizations: St. Patricks Episcopal Day School (Chairman), Georgetown University, National Symphony Orchestra, and the International Center for Research on Women.[11]
After redistricting, Delaney decided to run for the newly redrawn 6th District against 10-term Republican incumbent Roscoe Bartlett. The district had long been a Republican stronghold, but it had been significantly reconfigured. The Maryland General Assembly shifted heavily Republican Carroll County and a mostly Republican section of Frederick County to the heavily Democratic 8th district. It also shifted Republican-tilting sections of Harford and Baltimore counties to the already heavily Republican 1st district. Taking their place was a heavily Democratic section of Montgomery County, which ended just two blocks from Delaney's home in Potomac. On paper, this dramatically altered the district's demographics, turning it from a heavily Republican district into a Democratic-leaning district. While John McCain carried the 6th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried the new 6th with 56 percent.
During the primary, Delaney was endorsed by President Bill Clinton, U.S. Congresswoman Donna Edwards, Comptroller Peter Franchot, the Washington Post, and the Gazette.[12][13][14]On April 3, 2012, Delaney won the five-candidate Democratic primary field with 54% of the vote. The next closest opponent, State Senator Robert J. Garagiola, received 29% of the vote, 25 points behind Delaney.[15][16]
In the November 6, 2012 general election, Delaney defeated Bartlett by 59%-38%, a 21-point margin. Delaney won mostly on the strength of a nearly 56,000-vote margin in Montgomery County, which accounted for almost all of the overall margin of 58,900 votes.[17][4]
Key legislation Delaney has sponsored:
Delaney is married to his wife April, and has four daughters. He and his family live in Montgomery County, Maryland and attend Little Flower Catholic Church in Bethesda, Maryland. His wife is the Washington, D.C. Director for Common Sense Media, a non-profit organization dedicated to educating families on social media. Two of his daughters attend Northwestern University.
Delaney was the only former CEO of a publicly traded company serving in the 113th United States Congress.[21] He was also the 6th wealthiest member of Congress. His net worth is between $46,886,140 and $231,164,999.[22]"

The district includes just over half of Baltimore City, as well as most of Howard County. He previously served in the Maryland House of Delegates.


Cummings was born in Baltimore, the son of Ruth and Robert Cummings.[2] He graduated with honors from Baltimore City College in 1969. He later attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he served in the student government as sophomore class president, student government treasurer and later student government president. He became a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science.
Cummings attended law school at the University of Maryland School of Law, graduating in 1976 and entering the Maryland Bar in December 1976. He practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the House in the 1996 elections.
For 13 years, Cummings served in the Maryland House of Delegates. In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and was the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest position in the House of Delegates.
In December 2010 Edolphus Towns announced that he would not seek the position of Ranking Minority Member of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, even though his seniority and service as Chair would typically result in him filling this post. Reportedly, Towns withdrew because of a lack of support from Nancy Pelosi who feared that he would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader of Democrats in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Republican Darrell Issa.[3] Reportedly, the White House also wanted Towns to be replaced.[4] Cummings defeated Carolyn Maloney in a vote of the House Democratic Caucus.[3]
Cummings is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 108th United States Congress.
Cummings received praise and a boost in notoriety following the Congressional panel hearings on steroids in March 2005. While investigating the use of steroids in sports, the panel called numerous baseball players to testify, including former single season home run record holder Mark McGwire. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was ""taking the Fifth"", referring to the Fifth Amendment. McGwire responded by saying, ""I am here to talk about the future, not about the past."" The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.
On March 18, 2013, Cummings introduced the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 (H.R. 1233; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend federal law regarding the preservation, storage, and management of federal records.[5] One provision would require that all government employees using personal email accounts to do business copy their emails to an official government record system to be recorded and archived.[6] Cummings said ""I applaud the Senate for passing this good government bill that will give the American people timely access to the records presidents create while they are in office.""[7]
Cummings supported the Smart Savings Act (H.R. 4193; 113th Congress), a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).[8] Cummings called the bill a ""commonsense change"" and argued that the bill ""will enable workers to take full advantage of a diversified fund designed to yield higher returns.""[9]
Cummings introduced the All Circuit Review Extension Act (H.R. 4197; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals.[10] Cummings said that this program is important to extend because it ""allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.""[11] He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ""an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases.""[11]
Five-term Congressman Kweisi Mfume resigned in February 1996 to take the presidency of the NAACP. Cummings won a crowded seven-way Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority districtwith 37.5 percent of the vote. In the special election, he defeated Republican Kenneth Konder. He defeated Konder again in November to win the seat in his own right. Cummings has been reelected nine times since then with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 65 percent of the vote and even running unopposed in 2006. He won a tenth full term in 2014 with 69.9 percent of the vote.
Cummings serves on numerous Maryland boards and commissions including the Board of Visitors (BOV) to the United States Naval Academy and the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP). He is an honorary member of the Baltimore Zoo Board of Trustees.[14]
In addition to his many speaking engagements, he writes a biweekly column for the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper. He currently lives in the Madison Park community in Baltimore, and is an active member of the New Psalmist Baptist Church.
He is married to Maya Rockeymoore.[15]
In June 2011, his nephew Christopher Cummings, son of his brother James, was murdered at his off-campus house near Old Dominion University, where he was a student.[16]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes most of Montgomery County, an affluent suburban county adjacent to Washington, D.C., as well as portions of Carroll and Frederick counties.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the 2006 elections, Van Hollen became the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.
After the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the House Budget Committee, which was being vacated by outgoing chairman John Spratt who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010. Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan Committee on Deficit Reduction with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.[1] Van Hollen is running for the United States Senate in 2016 in a bid to replace incumbent Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring.[2]


Van Hollen was born in Karachi, Pakistan, the youngest of three children of American parents Edith Eliza (ne Farnsworth) and Christopher Van Hollen.[3][4] His father was a Foreign Service officer who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs (196972) and U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives (197276);[5] and his mother worked in the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, where she served as chief of the intelligence bureau for South Asia.[6][7][8] He also lived in Turkey, India, and Sri Lanka.[7] He returned to the United States for his junior year of high school, and attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where his grandfather once taught.[7]
He is an alumnus of the Kodaikanal International School, a very prestigious school in southern India. In 1982, Van Hollen graduated from Swarthmore College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy.[9] He continued his studies at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Public Policy degree, concentrating in national security studies, from the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1985.[9]
Van Hollen worked as a legislative assistant for defense and foreign policy to U.S. Senator Charles Mathias, a Republican from Maryland, from 1985 to 1987.[10] He was also a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (198789), and a legislative advisor for federal affairs to Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer (198991).[10] He earned a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1990.[9] He was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1990, and joined the law firm of Arent Fox.[11]
Van Hollen served in the Maryland General Assembly from 1991 to 2003, first in the House of Delegates (199195) and then in the State Senate (19952003).[9] In the Senate, he served on the Budget and Taxation Committee and the Health and Human Services Subcommittee. He led successful efforts to raise the tobacco tax, prohibit oil drilling in the Chesapeake Bay, mandate trigger locks for guns, and increase funding for education and healthcare.[7] In 2002, The Washington Post called Van Hollen ""one of the most accomplished members of the General Assembly.""[12]
Maryland's 8th District hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C. and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.[14]
In 2003, Van Hollen was named Outstanding New Member of the Year by the Committee for Education Funding, the nation's largest and oldest non-partisan education coalition.[15] The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (Keep Our PACT) Act, which would fully fund No Child Left Behind and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. He also introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in student loans that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.[16]
Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to outsource federal jobs.[17]
Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local homeland security efforts, education programs and community development projects. Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of Palestinian Statehood throughout his career in Congress.
Van Hollen often joins his colleague, Adam Schiff (CA-29), to discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House, with particular commentary on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.[18]
In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a Congressional Caucus on the Netherlands with Dutch-born Republican representative Pete Hoekstra. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the Netherlands and remember the Dutch role in establishing New York and the United States.
In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the Bush administration to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the Israeli-Lebanon War. He was heavily criticized by the Jewish and pro-Israel community, a large part of his constituency. According to the Washington Jewish Week, Van Hollen clarified but did not retract his position.[19]
In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes, saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.[20] In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a Green Bank to catalyze the financing of clean energy and energy efficiency projects.[21] He reintroduced the same bill again in 2014.[22]
In March 2010, when Charles Rangel was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having Sander Levin succeed to the Chairmanship over Pete Stark. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.[23]
On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance DISCLOSE Act.[24] He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.[25]
In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the Federal Election Commission, charging it with regulatory capture and the creation of a loop hole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason. Had it not been for the loophole, according to Hollen ""much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed."" [26]
Congressman Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of disability rights, especially for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent Connie Morella had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively liberal voting record, including support for abortion rights, gay rights, gun control and increased environmental protections.
After Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic Maryland Senate President Thomas V. ""Mike"" Miller made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one redistricting plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate Mark Kennedy Shriver in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring Prince George's County, an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.
In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former Clinton administration aide Ira Shapiro. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.
During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept Tom DeLay and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, HMO reform, trigger locks for handguns, and protecting the Chesapeake Bay from oil drilling. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.[14] Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County. However, Morella won most of the precincts she'd previously represented.
Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote. However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.
After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic. He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring 6th district, and lost his share of Prince George's County to the 4th district. In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County. Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over with 63 percent of the vote. While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.
Van Hollen has been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence,[27] a group which campaigns for more government regulation of guns.[28] Van Hollen received a 0% from the Gun Owners of America (GOA) in 2006.[29] In September 2008, Van Hollen voted against repealing portions of the D.C. Firearm Ban.[30]
Van Hollen also supports animal rights groups such as The Humane Society, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL), Big Cat Rescue (BCR), and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, all who gave him a 100% approval rating.[29] Van Hollen also received endorsement from the Humane Society Legislative Fund (HSLF) in 2010.[31] Although he supports animal rights groups, Van Hollen is not a supporter of organizations which aim to protect the rights of sportsmen who are animal owners, and received an approval rating of 0% from the Sportsmen's and Animal Owners' Voting Alliance (SAOVA).[29]
Van Hollen received a 0% rating for the Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW), and the National Taxpayers Union (NTU), in 2010.[29] Both these organizations advocate for lower taxes.[32][33] In 2006, Van Hollen received a 100% rating from Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), a group that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy.[34] Van Hollen does not support eliminating the federal estate tax.[29][35]
Van Hollen and his wife Katherine live in the town of Kensington with their three children, Anna, Nicholas, and Alexander. Van Hollen is of Dutch descent.[39]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party and a former city councilor and mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts.
A Springfield native, Neal graduated from American International College and received a master's degree from the University of Hartford. After graduating he became involved in politics, working as an assistant to the mayor of Springfield. He served as president of the Springfield City Council from 1979 to 1983 while teaching high school history courses and lecturing at local colleges. He served as mayor of Springfield from 1983 to 1989, overseeing a period of economic growth. With his political influence and a head start on contributions, he was nearly uncontested when he ran for election to the House of Representatives in 1988.
As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and former chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, Neal is an influential figure in House economic policy. He has also dedicated much of his career to USIreland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade.
Richard Edmund Neal was born February 14, 1949, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the oldest of three children. He and his two younger sisters were raised in Springfield by their mother, a housewife, and their father, a custodian at MassMutual. Neal's maternal grandparents were from Northern Ireland and his paternal grandparents were from Ireland. Neal's mother died of a heart attack when he was 13, and he was attending Springfield Technical High School when his father, an alcoholic, died. Neal and his two younger sisters moved in with their grandmother and later their aunt, forced to rely on Social Security checks as they grew up.[1][2][3]
After graduating high school, Neal attended Holyoke Community College in Holyoke and then American International College in Springfield, with the assistance of survivor's benefits. He graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. He then attended the University of Hartford's Barney School of Business and Public Administration, graduating in 1976 with an Master of Arts (postgraduate) in public administration.[2][4][5] Early in his career, Neal taught history at Cathedral High School.[3]
Neal began his political career as co-chairman of Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern's 1972 election campaign in Western Massachusetts.[6] In 1973 he became an assistant to Springfield Mayor William C. Sullivan. Neal was elected to the Springfield City Council in 1978 and was named President of the City Council in 1979.[4] The following year he was named as a delegate for presidential candidate Edward M. Kennedy at the 1980 Democratic National Convention.[7] While a city councilor, Neal taught history at Cathedral High School, and gave lectures at Springfield College, American International College, Springfield Technical Community College and Western New England College.[8]
In 1983 Neal made plans to challenge Theodore Dimauro, the Democratic incumbent Mayor of Springfield. This pressure led Dimauro to retire and Neal was elected mayor. Neal was re-elected in 1985 and 1987.[6] As mayor, Neal oversaw a period of significant economic growth, with over $400 million of development and investment in the city, and a surplus in the city budget. He worked to strengthen Springfield's appearance, pushing to revive and preserve the city's historic homes and initiating an influential Clean City Campaign to reduce litter.[8][9]
Neal ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1988 after 18-term Democratic incumbent Edward Boland retired. Boland had alerted Neal of his impending retirement, allowing the mayor a head-start on his campaign. Neal raised $200,000 in campaign contributions and collected signatures across the district before the retirement was formally announced.[10] As a result, no other Democrat or Republican even filed for the election.[citation needed] Neal defeated Communist Party candidate Louis R. Godena with over 80 percent of the vote.[11] In 1989 he was sworn in as United States Representative from Massachusetts's 2nd congressional district, which includes Springfield and the southern and western suburbs of Worcester.
Neal has won re-election in every term since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had an unfair advantage in the previous election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro's campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the Bank of New England's financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily.[10] He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 percent of the vote.[12] In 1992 his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, in which he had made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank.[10] After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa, Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.[13]
Since 1994, Neal has had little electoral opposition. In a Springfield Union-News poll taken in mid-October 1994, Neal was only ahead of John Briare by 6 percentage points. Neal then went on to spend nearly $500,000 against John Briare in the last 2 weeks of the election to defeat him. The 1994 general election also featured a third party candidate as well, Kate Ross, who received 6% of the vote. With blanks, Neal actually received only 51% of the vote in 1994.[14] After defeating Briare and Ross in 1994, he was then challenged by Mark Steele in 1996, respectively,[15][16] and ran unopposed in 1998. In 2000 he won the Democratic primary against Joseph R. Fountain, who challenged Neal's positions as ""anti-choice"" and ""anti-gun"".[17] Neal had been unopposed in the general election since 1996, but faced Republican opponent Tom Wesley[18] in the 2010 United States Congressional elections, which Neal won by a margin of 57% to 43%.
Neal has a generally liberal political record. He was given a 100 percent ""Liberal Quotient"" by Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) for his 2008 voting record, and the organization named him one of the year's ""ADA Heroes"".[20] He was given an 8.19 percent ""Lifetime Rating"" by the American Conservative Union (ACU) based on his votes from 1989 to 2009.[21] In the 110th United States Congress Neal voted with the Democratic Party leadership on 98.9 percent of bills;[22] in the 111th United States Congress, Neal voted with the Democratic party leadership 95% of the time.[23]
Neal was a member of the House Democratic Steering Committee in the 105th Congress and is now an at-large whip for the House Democrats.[4][10] Neal is a co-chair of the New England Congressional Caucus, a group aiming to advance the regional interests of New England.[4]
With several influential committee posts, Neal has made economic policy the focus of his career, although his success has been mixed.[1] He served his first two terms on the House Banking Committee, where he served on the Financial Services Subcommittee. As the banking reform law of 1991 was being drafted, he cautioned that President George H.W. Bush's proposal could negatively affect small businesses and minority-owned businesses. He introduced an amendment to require reports on lending to these businesses, which was adopted.[24]
In 1993 Neal moved to the House Ways and Means Committee, where he currently serves.[24] He has been chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures since 2008 and is a member of the Subcommittee on Trade. Previously he served on the Oversight and Social Security subcommittees.[25] In the late 2000s analysts considered Neal a likely frontrunner for chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and in the wake of Charles B. Rangel's 2010 departure he began actively seeking the post.[2][26] In June 2010, while pursuing the chairmanship, he invited campaign contributors to a $5,000-per-person weekend fundraiser in Cape Cod. This drew fire from The Boston Globe, which criticized him for ""[acceding] to the capital's money culture.""[27]
According to Congressional Quarterly's Politics in America, one of Neal's long-standing legislative priorities is to simplify the tax code.[1] Neal has long advocated repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), believing its effects have reached unreasonably low income brackets.[28] He led an unsuccessful movement to reform the AMT in 2007.[1] He successfully pushed in 1998 to exempt a child tax credit from being affected by the AMT, and in 2001 Congress made the exemption permanent at his urging.[29] He voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, saying that they would force millions onto the AMT.[30] Another priority of Neal's is to eliminate tax ""loopholes"" that favor higher-income individuals.[1] He was the lead proponent of a bill to require federal contractors to pay federal taxes for workers hired through offshore shell headquarters. The bill, H.R. 6081, passed both houses of Congress unanimously and was signed into law in May 2008.[31]
On trade policy, Neal has a moderate record, supporting lower trade barriers.[32] He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993.[10] In 1995 and 2002 he voted against fast track bills which gave the president the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress. In 2007 he voted in favor of the United States  Peru Trade Promotion Agreement despite some Democratic opposition.[1]
Neal is a strong supporter of the Social Security program. He moved from the Trade subcommittee to the Social Security subcommittee in 2005 to challenge President George W. Bush's attempts to partially privatize it.[30] He pushed a proposal to automatically enroll employees in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and successfully lobbied President Barack Obama to include it in a proposed 2009 budget outline.[1]
Descended from Irish nationalist grandparents on both sides, Neal has been an advocate for Irish concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. He is the co-chair of the ad hoc Committee on Irish Affairs, has been chairman of the Friends of Ireland since 2007, and was considered as a candidate for United States Ambassador to Ireland in 1998.[1][33] After the disarmament of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with Sinn Fin MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the action of disarmament and ensure a lasting peace had been reached.[34][35] Neal invited Sinn Fin President Gerry Adams to the inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009.[36] Neal has been named as one of the top 100 Irish-Americans by Irish America magazine and received the International Leadership Award from The American Ireland Fund in 2002.[33][37]
Neal is an opponent of the Iraq War, saying the war was based on false intelligence. He voted against the original invasion in 2003 and opposed President Bush's 2006 request to send additional troops.[30] He cited veterans' affairs as his top priority in 2010.[38]
A longtime advocate of health care reform, Neal was involved in the major health care reform efforts of 199394 and 200910. In working on the unsuccessful Clinton health care plan of 1993 he balanced his desire for health care reform with the interests of the major health insurance and medical companies in his district, achieving a compromise allowing insurance companies to charge small businesses higher premiums.[24] He was later involved writing the House's 2009 health care reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures subcommittee, he had a hand in developing the bill's financing plan. He explained that his priorities were to address ""pre-existing conditions, capping out-of-pocket expenses and making sure people don't lose their health care if they lose their job"".[38][39] Despite his support for the act, he spoke about his preference for a ""piecemeal"" approach to health care reform, saying it would allow for a more reasonable debate.[40]
Coming from a relatively Catholic district, Neal has a more conservative record on the issue of abortion than other Massachusetts representatives.[1] He said in 2010, ""I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [Given] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed and guess what? That's where the American people are.""[40] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases.[1] During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the StupakPitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion.[41] On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[1]
Neal is a Roman Catholic.[10] He lives in Springfield with his wife Maureen Neal, ne Conway. They have four children: Rory Christopher, Brendan Conway, Maura Katherine, and Sean Richard.[5] In addition to his duties as a congressman, Neal teaches a journalism course at the University of Massachusetts Amherst called ""The Politician and the Journalist"".[2]"
"190","","1997","1959","Massachusetts 2","American University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGovern_(American_politician)","Jim McGovern","Democratic","Congressional staff member","Roman Catholic","James Patrick ""Jim"" McGovern (born November 20, 1959) is a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts's 2nd congressional district. He is a member of the Democratic Party.
Born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, McGovern attended Worcester Academy. While in college he worked as a congressional aide to U.S. Senator George McGovern (to whom he has no relation), a two-time presidential candidate for whom he campaigned. From 1981 to 1996 he was a senior staff member for U.S. Representative Joe Moakley. McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, where he lost in the Democratic primary. He ran again in 1996, defeating Republican incumbent Peter Blute. He has since been re-elected.
A focus of his career has been international human rights, which he has advocated for in countries such as El Salvador, Sudan, and Colombia. He is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus[1] and has been ranked as one of the most liberal members of Congress.[2]


James Patrick McGovern[3] was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on November 20, 1959. He grew up in Worcester, where his mother Mindy was a dance instructor and his father Walter owned a liquor store.[4][5] In junior high school, he first became involved in politics by campaigning for Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern (to whom he is not related) in his unsuccessful 1972 presidential bid. After graduating from Worcester Academy he moved to Washington, D.C., where from 1977 to 1980, he worked as an aide to George McGovern. He attended American University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1981 and a Masters of Public Administration in 1984. George McGovern ran for president again in 1984, Jim McGovern was the state coordinator of his Massachusetts campaign branch, and he made his nominating speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.[5]
In 1981 McGovern joined the Capitol Hill staff of Joe Moakley, a Democratic U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.[5] He was appointed by Moakley in 1990 to lead a House task force investigating the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador by the Salvadoran Army. He later advocated cutting off U.S. funding for the U.S. Army School of the Americas, where several of the military members had been trained.[5]
McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, running in a crowded Democratic primary to represent the area then defined as Massachusetts's 3rd District.[5] The district, located in central and southeastern Massachusetts, included the city of Worcester and parts of Bristol, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Worcester counties.[6] During the campaign McGovern asserted that his record as ""a Washington insider"" would make him a more effective representative. Despite endorsements from George McGovern, Joe Moakley, and presidential aide George Stephanopoulos, McGovern lost in the primary to Massachusetts State Representative Kevin O'Sullivan.[5][7]
McGovern left Moakley's office in 1996 and moved back to Worcester, again running for Congress. Unopposed in the Democratic primary, he ran against Republican incumbent Peter Blute in the general election. His campaign slogan focused on unseating House Speaker Newt Gingrich: ""To dump Newt you have to dump Blute.""[8] Blute was endorsed by The Boston Globe and five other local papers, but McGovern won the election with 53 percent of the vote.[4][9] He has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been re-elected seven times. He ran unopposed in 2000 and 2002.[9]
The National Journal reported that McGovern has been able to use his Capitol Hill experience to help position himself as ""a power broker in the Democratic caucus."" In 2001, the dying Moakley asked Dick Gephardt to help McGovern attain a seat on Rules, which schedules much of the legislation for the House floor. He didn't receive that next seat, but was given a commitment for the next available Democratic seat. While on Rules, McGovern was able to use his experience with House procedures to his advantage. With Republicans comprising the majority of the panel, he ""showed a sharp partisan edge as he embraced parliamentary maneuvers that led to cries of outrage"" from House GOP members. McGovern is currently in position to take over the top Democratic position on Rules when Louise Slaughter retires.[10]
In 2004, he was opposed by Republican Ronald A. Crews, an evangelical pastor, former Georgia state legislator, and president of the Massachusetts Family Institute. Crews, a national conservative activist, challenged McGovern's positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, ""When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing he thinks about is gay marriage.  I don't think that is the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how to make the world a more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about.""[11] McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.[9]
In the 2010, he faced Republican Marty Lamb, a real estate lawyer, and independent Patrick J. Barron, a Department of Mental Health administrator.[12][13] He was re-elected with 57 percent of the vote.[14]
For his first three terms, McGovern served on the House Transportation Committee. He and fellow Massachusetts representative John Olver, who served on the House Appropriations Committee, would coordinate to bring extensive transportation funding to their respective districts. When criticized for his heavy use of earmarks, McGovern was quoted in response saying, ""It's not pork. It's nourishment.""[16]
McGovern supported economic stimulus efforts during the late-2000s recession, including the Economic Stimulus Act in February 2008[17] and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in October 2008.[18] He supported the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package.[19] Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for running up the national debt under George W. Bush, saying: ""It is somewhat ironic that the very people who drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining about the size of the tow truck.""[20] He voted to instate the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in February 2010.[21]
The Higher Education Act of 1998 included an amendment by McGovern that doubled Pell Grant funding for two years for students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their class.[22]
As co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus, McGovern is an advocate for expanding child nutrition programs both domestically and internationally.[23] In 2007 McGovern obtained $840 million in required funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the House version of the farm bill.[24] The HouseSenate conference committee stripped most of the funding from the final bill.[25]
As the co-chairman of the Congressional Hunger Center, McGovern has pushed for changes to foreign aid and hunger relief programs. He proposed establishing a ""hunger czar position"" to take on food issues. McGovern also took part in the Food stamp challenge, which entailed living on the average $21 in food stamps over the course of a week.[26]
McGovern has voted against major efforts to restrict illegal immigration, including the REAL ID Act of 2005,[27] the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005,[28] and the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[29]
McGovern believes health care is a human right. He voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, ultimately pushing for a robust public option which wasn't included in the final measure.[26]
In 2010, McGovern said that he thought the Supreme Court's Citizen's United case was wrongly decided, and that money does not equal free speech. He elaborated, saying that corporations should not ""have the same equality as a regular voter."" At first he said that ""the Constitution was wrong,"" but he later said that he had misspoken. On November 15, 2011 McGovern introduced the People's Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the Constitution's protections to only the rights of natural persons, and not corporations.[30] In January 2012, McGovern promoted his participation in a panel discussion entitled ""Corporations are not people.""[31] On July 14th 2014 McGovern introduced H.J. Res 119 with Representative Ted Deutch, which includes a section to address corporate personhood, as quoted here, ""Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections.""
McGovern has a pro-choice record on abortion. He voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in October 2003[32] and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in February 2004.[33] He supports stem cell research, having voted in favor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in 2005, 2007, and 2009.[34] He voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, which would have prevented employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[35] He voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage, in 2004 and 2006,[36] and co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act of 2009, which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.[37]
McGovern has vocally opposed the Iraq War since its inception.[5] He voted against the initial authorization of military force against Iraq in October 2002.[38] In May 2007, McGovern introduced H.R. 2237, to ""provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq."" The bill failed with a vote of 255 to 171.
He initially supported the War in Afghanistan, but has become increasingly skeptical of the war. In June 2010 he pushed a funding amendment which would require President Barack Obama to provide for a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. ""Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that quite frankly is going to lead us nowhere,"" said McGovern. ""We need to let Afghan President Hamid Karzai know that we're not a cheap date.  We expect him to clean up his government.""[39]
McGovern has been a prominent voice against the Islamist governments of Sudan for its prosecution of the war in Darfur. He has been arrested twice during protests outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C. On April 28, 2006, he was one of five members of Congress arrested while protesting atrocities in the Darfur region.[40] Also arrested were U.S. Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Jim Moran (D-Virginia), Rep. John Olver (D-Massachusetts), and Tom Lantos (D-California). McGovern was arrested again at the Sudanese embassy on April 27, 2009, this time accompanied by Reps John Lewis (D-Georgia), Donna Edwards (D-Maryland), Lynn Woolsey (D-California), and Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota).[41] He was arrested again on March 16, 2012 alongside George Clooney during a protest outside of the Sudanese embassy speaking out against the Bashir regime in the Sundan.[42]
In April 2007, he called for the United States and other countries to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China to protest the Chinese government's support of the Sudanese government and, by extension, the genocide in Darfur.[43]
McGovern has traveled several times to Colombia to meet with human rights advocates, and has been very critical of Plan Colombia and US military aid to that country. On March 25, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an unsigned editorial suggesting that McGovern supported the Marxist FARC rebels in Colombia. According to the Journal, an investigation of the computer hard drive of the recently killed Ral Reyes, second-in-command of the FARC, had turned up material indicating an ardent effort on the part of McGovern to do business directly with the FARC. The article said that McGovern had been working with an American go-between, who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia's elected and popular government.[44] In response to these charges, McGovern said that his concern was to help win the release of hostages held by the FARC, as requested by several families of Americans held by the FARC.[45] He said that he had no sympathy for the rebels or for their hostage-taking.
On February 13, 2009, McGovern offered a resolution on the subject of the trial of the Iranian Bah' leadership co-sponsored by seven others in H.Res. 175  ""Condemning the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights"" which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.[46] The situation has gathered international attention including defense of Nobel Laureate attorney Shirin Ebadi in June[47] after she received threats in April warning her against making speeches abroad, and defending Iran's minority Baha'i community[48] (See Arrest of Bah' leaders).
In 2000, McGovern met with the Cuban grandmothers of five-year-old Elian Gonzalez.[49] Elian's mother had drowned while trying to escape from Cuba with the boy. Although Elian had reached Florida safely, McGovern advocated the boy's return to his father's custody in Cuba.[50]
In 2002 McGovern joined the Congressional Cuba Working Group, which advocated for lowering restrictions on travel and food shipment to Cuba.[5] He is the current co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (formerly the ""Human Rights Caucus"").[51] His work on human rights issues earned him the Washington Office on Latin America's[52] ""Human Rights Award"" in 2007[53]
On November 18, 2013, McGovern introduced the simple resolution Urging the Government of Burma to end the persecution of the Rohingya people and respect internationally recognized human rights for all ethnic and religious minority groups within Burma (H.Res. 418; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives.[54] The resolution calls on the government of Burma to end the persecution and discrimination of the Rohingya people within its borders and calls on the United States government and the international community to pressure the Burmese to do so.[54][55] The resolution is in response to allegations of Burmese Buddhist attacks on Rohingya Muslims that may have occurred earlier in 2014.[55] McGovern argued that ""the Burmese government needs to recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic group. The situation is dire and rapidly deteriorating.""[55]
McGovern has aligned himself with liberal and progressive causes. ""It's no secret that I'm a liberal,"" he said in 2010. ""I didn't poll any of this stuff, but I am who I am.""[56] Political interest groups generally rank McGovern as one of the most liberal members of Congress. The National Journal ranked him among the seven most liberal representatives.[2] The Washington Post noted that the political similarities between McGovern and his mentor, 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, are numerous: ""Both are considered among the most liberal and anti-war lawmakers of their generation. The most prominent difference? They aren't related.[26]
From 1997 to 2007, the liberal advocacy group Americans for Democratic Action gave him an average vote rating of 98.5 percent, whereas its conservative counterpart, the American Conservative Union, gave him an average vote rating of 2.5 percent.[57] The United States Chamber of Commerce, which advocates for business-oriented policies, has given McGovern a 33 percent lifetime rating as of 2011.[58]
McGovern lives in Worcester with his wife, Lisa Murray McGovern, a former aide to U.S. Representative Gerry Studds. They have two children, Patrick and Molly. He has two sisters, who are teachers in the Worcester public school system.[59] In November 2010 he underwent surgery to remove his thyroid gland after being diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, from which he is expected to recover.[60]

From 2007 to 2013 she represented Massachusetts's 5th congressional district, the district her husband Paul Tsongas served prior to being elected to the United States Senate. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Following John Kerry's appointment as Secretary of State, she was widely expected to run in the 2013 special election for the Senate seat once held by her husband; she put such speculations to rest when she announced her endorsement of Representative Ed Markey instead.


Tsongas was born Nicola Dickson Sauvage on April 26, 1946, in Chico, California. Her mother Marian Susan (ne Wyman) was an artist and copywriter, and her father Colonel Russell Elmer Sauvage was an engineer in the United States Army Air Forces who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2] Tsongas graduated in 1964 from Narimasu American High School in Japan while her father was stationed at Fuchu Air Force Base. Tsongas spent one year at Michigan State University, then transferred to Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, and graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts in religion.[3][4] After college she moved to New York City, where she took a job as a social worker for the Department of Welfare.[5] Tsongas earned her Juris Doctor from Boston University and started Lowell's first all-female law practice.[6]
Tsongas interned in Arlington, Virginia, for presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy during summer 1967; at a party while there she met Paul Tsongas, then an aide to Republican Congressman Brad Morse. In 1969, she married Paul; they had three daughters: Ashley, Katina, and Molly.[7][8] A politician, Paul served in the House from Massachusetts's 5th congressional district from 1975 to 1979, and the Senate from 1979 to 1985. After being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Paul resigned from Congress. Tsongas moved their family from Washington, D.C., back to Massachusetts to care for Paul as he underwent treatments.[9] After seemingly being cured of his disease, in 1992 Paul ran for the Democratic Party nomination for President; he came in third behind former California Governor Jerry Brown and eventual winner Bill Clinton. Paul's cancer later returned; he died of pneumonia and liver failure on January 18, 1997.
Prior to her election to the House, Tsongas worked as the Dean of External Affairs at Middlesex Community College,[5] as a Board Member of Fallon Community Health Plan[10] and served on the Lowell Civic Stadium and Arena Commission, which oversees several sites including the Tsongas Arena.[5] In 2001, Representative Marty Meehan appointed Tsongas to head a foundation to provide education funding for children of the victims of the September 11 attacks.[11]
After Marty Meehan resigned in 2007 to serve as Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Tsongas ran in the special election. Tsongas defeated four other candidates to win the Democratic primary with 36% of the vote.[12] During her initial campaign Tsongas received endorsements from The Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, and the Lowell Sun.[13][14] During the general election, former President Bill Clinton, who defeated her husband for the Democratic nomination in 1992, campaigned for her. At an event in Lowell Clinton remarked: ""Congress will be a better place because she is there.""[15] Tsongas won the special election against Republican Jim Ogonowski with 51% of the vote on October 17;[16] she became the only female Representative from Massachusetts, and fourth in the state's history.[17]
After running unopposed in 2008, in 2010 Tsongas faced Republican Jon Golnik, a small businessman and former Wall Street currency trader. During the campaign Tsongas attacked Golnik's history as a Vice President of AIG,[18] which Golnik called hypocritical, as she had stock in AIG and other large corporations.[19] Tsongas defeated Golnik with 52% of the vote.[20] Following redistricting after the 2010 census, Tsongas ran for re-election in the reconfigured Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district in 2012. In a rematch, she again defeated Golnick.[21]
A major issue in her initial election was whether the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto.[23] Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.[24]
As a candidate in 2007, Tsongas promised to withdraw troops and end the Iraq War.[25] The first bill she introduced aimed to do this by implementing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq; however, the bill died in committee.[26] In 2010, Tsongas along with other women in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, visited Afghanistan to oversee the war effort. Upon returning, Tsongas spoke of the need for the involvement of women in rebuilding of government.[27]
Tsongas is an advocate for universal health care and supports a public health insurance option.[28][29] In 2010 she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.[30] In 2012 Tsongas joined a Republican-led effort to repeal a 2.3% sales tax on medical-device manufacturers, which passed the House 270146; 36 other Democrats voted for it.[31] Tsongas is pro-choice and received a 100% approval rating from Planned Parenthood in 2008.[32] A supporter of LGBT rights, Tsongas cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act;[33] and voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces.
Following Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, Tsongas was the only Representative from Massachusetts to call for his resignation, saying that ""it would be appropriate for [him] to step down.""[34] In the 2012 Massachusetts Senate election, Tsongas was the first major Democratic politician to endorse the winner, Elizabeth Warren, whom she called ""a fighter for middle class families"".[35] Following President Barack Obama's designation of John Kerry as United States Secretary of State, there was much speculation that she would run for his seat, which her husband had previously held.[36] Though Tsongas briefly considered a run, she responded she would best be able to serve the people of Massachusetts by continuing to serve in the House, and instead endorsed fellow Representative Ed Markey.[37][38]
On January 23, 2013, Tsongas introduced the Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act (H.R. 412; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments concerning the Nashua River in Massachusetts for study for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.[39] Tsongas discussed the river's history and past pollution problems in her testimony about the bill.[40] She argued that the study would allow stakeholders to work together to ""ensure that it remains a great place for canoeing, fishing, and enjoying the outdoors.""[40]"

Harvard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_III","Joe Kennedy","Democratic","Prosecutor, assistant district attorney","Roman Catholic","Joseph Patrick ""Joe"" Kennedy III (born October 4, 1980) is an American lawyer, politician, and a member of the Kennedy family, serving as the U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 4th congressional district since 2013. He is a Democrat whose district stretches from the western suburbs of Boston to the state's South Coast. A son of former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, he worked as a Peace Corps volunteer and as an assistant district attorney in the Cape and Islands and Middlesex offices before his election to Congress.
Born in Brighton, Massachusetts, Kennedy was raised in the Boston area with his twin brother, Matthew Rauch ""Matt"" Kennedy. After attending Stanford University he spent two years in the Dominican Republic as a member of the Peace Corps, and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School in 2009. He resigned as a prosecutor in early 2012 to run for the seat held by retiring Congressman Barney Frank. He easily won the Democratic nomination through his associations with the Kennedy family, and went on to defeat Republican candidate Sean Bielat. He was sworn into office in January 2013 and sits on the Foreign Affairs and Science, Space, and Technology committees.


Kennedy was born October 4, 1980,[1] to businessman/politician Joseph Patrick ""Joe"" Kennedy and Sheila Brewster Rauch. He was born eight minutes after his fraternal twin brother Matt. He and Matt are the eldest grandsons of Senator Robert Francis ""Bobby"" Kennedy and socialite Ethel Skakel.[2][3] Joseph and Matthew were born in Brighton (a neighborhood of Boston), and were raised there and in the coastal town of Marshfield, also spending summers in Cape Cod.[4] From birth, Kennedy was engulfed in politics; in 1980, his parents were working on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, the boys' great-uncle. Kennedy's father was elected to Congress in 1986. The pressures of political life strained Joseph and Sheila's marriage, and they divorced in 1991. The twins spent the following years moving between Brighton and Cambridge.[3]
After graduating from the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Kennedy along with his brother enrolled in Stanford University, where he majored in management science and engineering. Kennedy's reputation as a teetotaler earned him the college nickname ""Milkman"", as his teammates on the club Lacrosse team would jocularly order him glasses of milk at bars.[3][5] While at Stanford, Kennedy roomed with NBA player Jason Collins.[6]
After graduating in 2003, Kennedy joined the Peace Corps; a fluent speaker of Spanish, he worked in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic from 2004 to 2006, helping local tour guides in the 27 Charcos reserve in the Ro Damajagua Park. He reorganized the group with some outside backing, directing the guides to rebuild parts of the park and develop skills to make the operation more attractive to tourists.[3][5] ""We basically created a union,"" said Kennedy, who reported that the group's efforts won higher wages for employees while improving revenue for the tour companies.[7] According to a press release, his other activities in the Peace Corps included ""stints as an Anti-Poverty Consultant for the Office of the President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and a Research Analyst for the United Nations Development Program.""[6]
In April 2006, Kennedy returned to Massachusetts, where he and his brother co-chaired Ted Kennedy's re-election campaign. That fall, Kennedy enrolled in Harvard Law School pursuing a degree in law.[3] While in school, Kennedy worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, providing legal aid to low-income tenants with foreclosure cases in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Kennedy worked as a technical editor for the Harvard Human Rights Journal, on a staff with his classmate and future wife, Lauren Anne Birchfield.[3] In 2007 he and Birchfield co-founded Picture This: Justice and Power, an after-school program for youths in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.[8][9] He began an internship at the Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office in 2008.[6]
After graduating from Harvard in 2009, Kennedy was hired at the Cape and Islands Office as an assistant district attorney (DA). He considered running for the Cape-based U.S. House seat held by retiring Rep. Bill Delahunt in early 2010, but decided against it.[10] In September 2011, he joined the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office, also as an assistant DA.[11] He resigned several months later, in preparation for the announcement that he would seek political office.[12]
In January 2012, Kennedy announced he would form an exploratory committee to run in the newly redrawn 4th congressional district. Congressman Barney Frank, who had previously represented the district, had announced his retirement, leaving an open field for the seat.[12][13] Kennedy explained, ""I will then begin to reach out to the people of the Fourth District in order to hear directly from them about the challenges they are facing and their ideas on how we can restore fairness to our system. I will make a final decision about entering the race in the weeks thereafter.""[14][15]
Kennedy officially entered the election in February 2012.[16] In an announcement video, Kennedy declared, ""I believe this country was founded on a simple idea: that every person deserves to be treated fairly, by each other and by their government"".[17] In the same video, Kennedy vowed to fight for a ""fair job plan"", a ""better educational system"", a ""fair tax code"" and a ""fair housing policy"".[17]
While several Democratic candidates had prepared to enter the race, the field nearly cleared once Kennedy announced his candidacy. His family roots made him the overwhelming favorite among Massachusetts Democrats.[18][19] In the September 6 primary, he faced Rachel Brown, a Lyndon LaRouche acolyte; and Herb Robinson, an engineer and musician, winning the primary with 90 percent of the vote.[20][21]
In the general election campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive and member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat.[22] In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan.[23][24] Kennedy raised over $4 million in support of his campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000.[22] Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.[25]
Kennedy was sworn into the 113th U.S. Congress on January 3, 2013, and was assigned to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He praised the technology committee assignment as an opportunity to secure federal funding, including National Science Foundation and Small Business Innovation Research grants, for life sciences companies in his district. As a freshman in his party, he was unable to secure a seat on the Education Committee which he had sought.[27]
During a February science committee hearing, he questioned Texas Instruments president Richard Templeton regarding the company's efforts to compensate cancer-stricken former employees of its Attleboro, Massachusetts, nuclear facility.[28][29] A prolific fundraiser, he launched his political action committee, the 4MA PAC, in April.[30][31] As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he traveled in May with four other legislators to Afghanistan, where they met with President Hamid Karzai and members of the military.[32] That month he was named chairman of Governor Deval Patrick's STEM Advisory Council.[33]
On July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one of seven members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) who voted against the Amash-Conyers amendment to limit Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.[34]
On November 4, 2014, Kennedy was re-elected, winning a second term as part of that year's midterm elections.[35]
Kennedy married health policy lawyer[36] Lauren Anne Birchfield (born c. 1984) in Corona del Mar, California, on December 1, 2012.[37] The couple met in a Harvard Law School class taught by future senator Elizabeth Warren.[38] Kennedy is a practicing Roman Catholic.[26] Kennedy's net worth is estimated to be between $15,605,250 and $55,750,000.[39]"

She is a resident of Melrose, Massachusetts and a member of the Democratic Party. She was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 2008 to 2011, and a member of the Massachusetts Senate from 2011 to 2013.
Born in Connecticut, Clark worked as an attorney in several states before moving to Massachusetts in 1995, where she worked in state government. She joined the Melrose School Committee in 2002, becoming committee chair in 2005. She was first elected to the state legislature in 2007, and contributed to legislation regarding criminal justice, education, and municipal pensions. She won the 2013 special election for the U.S. House of Representatives to succeed Ed Markey in the 5th district and sits on the House Natural Resources Committee.


Katherine Marlea Clark[2] was born July 17, 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut.[3] She attended St. Lawrence University, Cornell Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[4] She studied in Nagoya, Japan in 1983.[2]
In her early career she worked as an attorney in Chicago, then moved to Colorado where she worked as a clerk for a federal judge and later as a staff attorney for the Colorado District Attorneys Council.[5] She moved to Massachusetts in 1995 and became general counsel for the state Office of Child Care Services.
In 2001 Clark moved to Melrose, where she was elected to the Melrose School Committee, taking her seat in January 2002.[5] Clark first ran for the Massachusetts Senate in 2004, but lost 57 to 43 percent to Republican incumbent Richard Tisei.[6][7] In January 2005 she was unanimously elected chairwoman of the Melrose School Committee.[8] In 2006, she decided to run for the 32nd Middlesex seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives when incumbent Mike Festa began a run for Middlesex district attorney, but withdrew after he dropped out of the race.[9]
Clark was appointed co-chair of Victory 2006, the state Democratic Party's campaign and fundraising effort for the 2006 gubernatorial election.[10] She spent some time as Chief of Policy and Government Relations in the state Attorney General's office.[11]
Festa resigned his state House seat in October 2007, and Clark entered the special election to succeed him. In the campaign she emphasized her experience as an attorney and made ""developing stability in state aid"" her top policy issue. She won the Democratic primary in January with 65% of the vote, defeating two other Melrose Democrats.[11][12] She defeated Republican real estate businessman Mark B. Hutchison 63 to 37 percent.[13][14] In November 2008, she won re-election to a full term unopposed.[15]
Sworn in March 13, 2008,[16] she represented the towns of Melrose and Wakefield. She voted in favor of a sales tax increase saying ""Voting for a sales tax (increase) certainly was not an easy vote, by any means, especially in this economic climate. And one of the reasons, primary reasons, I did it was for the local aid and for the MBTA. So, to have the ink barely dry on the budget, and have the MBTA coming back and asking for a fare increase to remove draconian service cuts, is something that does make me and my constituents angry."" [17]
Clark's committee assignments were as follows.
When Tisei resigned his state Senate seat to run for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, she ran for his senate seat. In the Democratic primary, she defeated Stoneham attorney Michael S. Day 64%-36%.[19][20] She defeated Republican Craig Spadafora in the November 2010 general election 52%-48%.[21]
Clark was sworn in January 5, 2011.[22] She is a pro-choice legislator and has been endorsed in her state legislator campaigns by both NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts and the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund.[23][24][25]
In 2011 she was co-chair of the Joint Committee on Public Service, where she was lead author of the Senate version of a bill to reform municipal pensions.[26][27] For her work in 2011, she received legislator of the year awards from the Massachusetts Municipal Association and the Massachusetts Police Association.[28][29] In 2012 she authored a law that takes steps to ensure that all Massachusetts students are reading at grade level by third grade.[30] Also in 2012, her bill extending restraining orders in domestic violence cases to also cover victims' pets, which are often used as pawns in abusive relationships, was signed as part of a larger law on animal shelters.[31][32] In 2013 she co-sponsored a bill expanding the state's wiretapping authority, which was strictly limited under existing law, in order to help police better investigate violent street crime.[33] At the same time, she co-sponsored a bill to secure electronic privacy protections, requiring police to have probable cause before investigating the electronic records of individuals.[34] She filed another bill tightening sex offender laws, imposing stricter penalties and making offender data more accessible to agencies and the public.[35][36] The Womens Bar Association of Massachusetts honored Clark as their 2013 Legislator of the Year for her service on women's issues.[37]
Clark's committee assignments in the state Senate were as follows.
Clark was the Democratic nominee in the 2013 special election for the U.S. House of Representatives. On December 10, 2013, she easily won the election and replaced Ed Markey as U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 5th district.[40] She was endorsed by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley[41] and had also received the endorsement of EMILY's List.[42] On October 16, 2013 she won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote.

In early March of 2015, Clark decided not to attend the speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before a joint session of Congress. Clark said shes remains committed to maintaining and strengthening what she called the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel, but noted the invitation was offered without first consulting the Obama administration.[46]
Clark's husband, Rodney S. Dowell, is an attorney and executive director of the Lawyers Concerned for Lawyers program.[47] They live in Melrose and have three sons, Addison, Jared, and Nathaniel Dowell.[4]"

After graduating from Harvard University in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science in physics, Moulton joined the United States Marine Corps. He served four tours in the Iraq War and between those tours earned his master's degrees in business and public administration in a dual program at Harvard University.
He entered politics in 2014, running for Massachusetts's 6th congressional district. He defeated incumbent Congressman John F. Tierney in the Democratic primary and then defeated former State Senator and 2012 nominee Richard Tisei in the general election.


Seth Wilbur Moulton was born on October 24, 1978 in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of Lynn Alice (ne Meader) and Wilbur Thomas Moulton, Jr.,[2][3] and grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts, as the oldest of three siblings.[4] He graduated from Phillips Academy Andover in 1997[5] and attended Harvard University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in physics in 2001. He gave the Undergraduate English Oration at his commencement address, focusing on the importance of service.[6]
Moulton joined the Marine Corps after graduation, a few months before the September 11 attacks,[7] and attended the Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia. After graduating in 2002 with the rank of second lieutenant, Moulton was among the first service members to enter Baghdad at the beginning of the Iraq War.[4][6]
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Moulton led of one of the first infantry platoons to enter Baghdad. He served a total of four tours of duty in Iraq from 2003 to 2008.[4] Moulton took part in the 2003 Battle of Nasiriyah, leading a platoon that cleared a hostile stronghold. In that action, he went to the aid of a soldier wounded by friendly fire, and for his actions he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal for valor.[8] Moulton was active in combat against insurgent forces in Iraq, including the 2004 Battle of Najaf against the militia of Muqtada al-Sadr.[9] Over two days he ""fearlessly exposed himself to enemy fire"" as his platoon was pinned down under heavy fire and then directed the supporting fire that repelled the attack. He received the Bronze Star Medal for his actions in this battle.[8] He told only his campaign manager, a former marine, about these awards, keeping them secret even from his parents. When Boston Globe reporter Walter V. Robinson disclosed in October 2014 that Moulton had earned the Bronze Star and the Navy Commendation Medal, Moulton said that ""There is a healthy disrespect among veterans who served on the front lines for people who walk around telling war stories"". He said he was uncomfortable calling attention to his own awards out of respect to ""many others who did heroic things and received no awards at all."" He asked Robinson not to refer to him as a hero: ""Look, we served our country, and we served the guys next to us. And it's not something to brag about."" The Globe reported that ""his voice choked with emotion"" as he added: ""The greatest honor of my life was to lead these men in my platoon, even though it was a war that I and they disagreed with.""[8]
In 2008, General David Petraeus requested Moulton's assignment to work as a special liaison with tribal leaders in Southern Iraq during his fourth tour of duty in Iraq. Following that tour, Moulton left the Marine Corps with the rank of Captain.[4][10][11]
In 2003, Moulton co-hosted a television program with his Iraqi interpreter, Mohammed Harba, called ""Moulton and Mohammed,"" during which they discussed regional conditions in the period following the U.S. invasion before an audience of U.S. servicemen and Iraqi citizens.[12] The show ended after three months when Moulton's unit left the area.[4]
Between 2003 and 2008, Moulton was frequently interviewed about his experiences as an officer in Iraq by U.S. national media, including CNN, MSNBC, and NPR programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered.[4][13]
And are you telling me that's the best America can do? No. Don't tell me that, don't tell the Marines who fought for a month in Najaf that, don't tell the marines who are still fighting every day in Fallujah that that's the best America can do... That makes me angry.
Moulton was also prominently featured in the Academy Award-nominated 2007 documentary No End in Sight. In the film, Moulton criticized the U.S. government's handling of the occupation of Iraq. UCLA anthropology professor Sherry Ortner wrote that Moulton's comments ""sum[med] up the emotional tone of the film.""[14]
Following his return from active duty with the Marines in 2008, Moulton attended a dual degree program at the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School, receiving master's degrees in business and public administration in 2011.[15]
After graduate school, Moulton worked for one year as managing director of the Texas Central Railway, a transportation firm which is in the process of building a high-speed rail connection between Houston and DallasFort Worth, Texas.[16]
Moulton had considered running against Democratic Representative John F. Tierney of Massachusetts's 6th congressional district as an Independent in the 2012 elections, but he decided against it in July 2012, saying that ""the time and the logistics of putting together all the campaign infrastructure, organizing the volunteers... the fundraising  it's just too much to accomplish in three months."" Had he run and been elected, he would have caucused with the Democrats. He told Roll Call that his own polling ""showed there was in fact a clear path to victory"" and said he might run for office in the future.[17]
On July 8, 2013, Moulton announced his candidacy in the 2014 Congressional race for Massachusetts' 6th district.[18] The race had been recognized for its competitiveness by national and regional media throughout the election cycle.[19][20][21][22][23] Moulton challenged incumbent Congressman John Tierney in the Democratic primary. According to Time magazine political columnist Joe Klein, Moulton ""has refused to distinguish himself from Tierney on most issues. He's running on freshness and dynamism.""[22] The Boston Globe editorial board wrote: ""Moulton and Tierney share nearly identical political views, but Moulton's background, and his approach to discussing the issues, suggests an openness to new perspectives.""[16]
John Tierney's campaign claimed in campaign advertisements that Moulton received campaign contributions from a New Hampshire political action committee that previously donated only to Republicans, implying that Moulton must hold conservative views.[24] Moulton denied being more conservative than his opponent,[25] and stated that the Republican PAC donation was returned. Public Federal Election Commission filings confirmed that the donation was returned in February 2014.[24]
Moulton said that he personally opposed the Iraq War in which he served. A Tierney campaign staff member said that Moulton had ""changed his mind"" and highlighted Tierney's vote in Congress to oppose the 2002 resolution authorizing the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.[25] Moulton also received the first-ever political endorsement from Ret. Gen. Stanley McChrystal during the campaign.[26]
Moulton defeated Tierney in the primary, winning with 50.8% of the vote to Tierney's 40.1%.[27]
Moulton was endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren[28] for the general election. In October 2014, he withdrew from a debate sponsored by radio station WGBH because of a series of New York fundraisers, where he welcomed Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[29] The Moulton and Tisei campaigns were held up as an example of how candidates can compete with respect for each other.[30]
Moulton defeated Republican nominee Richard Tisei in the general election.
Moulton was sworn-in to the 114th United States Congress on January 3, 2015.[31]
Moulton and his campaign have described him as a ""progressive Democrat"".[34]
Moulton has stated his opposition to sending U.S. troops back to Iraq in 2014, saying ""We need to deal with the ISIS threat, but fundamentally it's a threat that the Iraqi army should be able to address on its own.""[35]
When the Salem News endorsed Moulton in the 2014 Democratic Primary, it cited his views in favor of same-sex marriage, abortion rights, gun control, and paths to citizenship for illegal residents. It also noted his opposition to attempts to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.[36]"

Boston College Law School","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Capuano","Mike Capuano","Democratic","Mayor of Somerville","Roman Catholic","Michael Everett ""Mike"" Capuano (/kpjuno/; born January 9, 1952) is an American politician who serves as the U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 7th congressional district. A member of the Democratic Party, his district includes the northern three-fourths of Boston, as well as Somerville and Cambridge. Prior to being elected to Congress he served as an Alderman and later Mayor of Somerville.
He was born and raised in Somerville, and after graduating from Dartmouth College and Boston College Law School, he worked as an attorney and Somerville alderman. After losing two elections for Mayor in 1979 and 1981, he went to work as legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court. He ran for a Mayor a third time in 1989 and won, serving from 1990 to 1999.
In 1998 he navigated a crowded Democratic primary to replace Joseph Kennedy II in Congress and has since been re-elected six times. He represented the state's 8th district until it was redrawn in 2013 into the 7th district. In Congress he is a staunch liberal and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He ran in the 2010 special election to fill the seat in the United States Senate made vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy, his predecessor's uncle, but lost the primary to Martha Coakley, who in turn lost the general election to Republican Scott Brown.


Capuano was born January 9, 1952 in the Spring Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, to Rita Marie (ne Garvey) and Andrew Capuano. His father left to serve in World War II shortly after getting married, and after returning ran for the Somerville Board of Aldermen, and became the first Italian American elected to the board. His mother was of Irish descent.[1][2]
Capuano graduated from Somerville High School in 1969, and later attended Dartmouth College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. Capuano later went on to earn his Juris Doctor in 1977 from Boston College Law School, specializing in tax law.[3]
In 1976, Capuano was elected to the Somerville Board of Aldermen representing Ward 5, once served in by his father.[3][4] Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville.[5] In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August.[6] Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person runoff election.[7] Capuano promoted his opposition to the state ballot question Proposition 2 and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face of tight city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed.[8] Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote.[9]
From 1978 to 1984 Capuano served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court's Joint Committee on Taxation.[10] Capuano left the committee in 1984 to join the Beacon Hill law firm and lobbying group Joyce & Joyce.[5] In 1985 he returned to the Somerville Board of Aldermen as an at-large member.[10]
In 1989 Capuano ran for Mayor a third time in and won.[3] Capuano served as Mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a reputation as a hands-on administrator.[11][12] One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces.[13] As Mayor he oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.[11]
In 1998, Joseph Kennedy II announced his retirement after six terms in what was then the 8th District. Capuano entered a crowded 10-way primary for the seat. The early front-runner was former Boston Mayor and US Vatican Ambassador Raymond Flynn. However, Capuano won the primary with 23%, largely due to large turnout in Somerville. The district is so heavily Democratic that Capuano's primary victory all but assured him of election in November.[11][12] He easily won the general election in November, taking 81 percent of the vote. He has been reelected seven times, never dropping below 80% of the vote. Since his initial run for the seat, Capuano has been unopposed in all but two reelection bids; he faced a minor-party candidate in 2006 and an independent in 2012. To date, he has only faced a Republican once, during his initial run in 1998.
During his tenure, Capuano has helped found five congressional caucuses, on: Community Health Centers;[15] Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities;[16] Sudan;[17] and Korea;[18] as well as one for former Mayors.[19]
Capuano voted against the War in Iraq and supported immediate withdrawal of troops. In 2005 Capuano visited Iraq to and met with military leaders to assess the future of the region.[20] Capuano is considered to be one of the biggest supporters in Congress for increasing international aid funding,[21] and has advocated bringing attention to the crisis in Sudan and helped secure funding aimed at assisting developing African nations.[22]
Capuano is pro-choice and supports open access to abortions. In 2012 a fundraiser hosted by Pope John XXIII High School where Capuano and fellow Massachusetts Congressman Ed Markey were to receive awards was cancelled due to their ""positions [being] inconsistent with church doctrine;"" both were humble in response to the news.[23] During the 2010 Senate Democratic primary Capuano criticized his opponent Martha Coakley, claiming she wouldn't have voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with StupakPitts Amendment which would have barred federal funding of abortions; which Capuano said he only did to ""keep the health care debate alive.""[24] Capuano's comments were characterized by WBUR political analyst as ""an empty charge against her since he has the same position as she does.""[25]
After the 2006 election that created a Democratic majority in the House, he was appointed Chairman of the Speaker's Task Force on Ethics Enforcement by Nancy Pelosi, with whom he has a close relationship. After serving as the Chairman of the Task Force on Ethics Enforcement, in 2008 Capuano introduced H.R. 895 which established the Office of Congressional Ethics.[26] Capuano has an long relationship with former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whom he shared a Washington, D.C. apartment with for 12 years. Following Weiner's sexting scandal Capuano did not call on him to resign, saying: ""I am not the guy who likes to judge other people. I figure that is between them and the people who are appropriately named to do that and that is the Ethics Committee.""[27]
Capuano is a strong supporter of labor rights and unions; in February 2011 during a rally at Beacon Hill in Boston, in support of the 2011 Wisconsin budget protests, Capuano told the crowd, ""Im proud to be here with people who understand that its more than just sending an email to get you going. Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary"". Following criticism, Capuano expressed regret for his ""choice of words.""[28]
Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEO's for their practices, saying at one point: ""You come to us today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, 'We're sorry, we didn't mean it, we won't do it again, trust us.' Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks and they say the same thing.""[29] Capuano's speech was included in the 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H. Ferguson as being about ""the systemic corruption of the United States by the financial services industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption.""[30]
A self-described ""fiscal conservative,""[31] in 2013 Capuano joined Senator Elizabeth Warren and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in a rally against the then-upcoming sequester, with Capuano calling it ""stupid.""[32] In 2012 Capuano along with fellow Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank introduced legislation to combine the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the ""Securities and Derivatives Commission.""[33]
Capuano ran for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth in the 1994 election, running against former State Representatives Augusto Grace and William F. Galvin for the Democratic nomination. During the race he framed himself as an advocate for the poor and urban communities, and criticized aid formulas which he argued left less-wealthy municipalities with less per-capita revenue. To appear on the Democratic primary required the support of at least 15% of delegates in the state party convention. In what the Boston Globe deemed ""an embarrassing defeat,"" he was disqualified from the race with only 13% of delegate votes. When asked why he staged the difficult race to begin with, he responded, ""Because I wasn't ready to run for Governor.""[13]
After the death of incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy, a special election to succeed him was scheduled. On September 8, 2009, Capuano collected nomination papers to run for the seat[34] and on September 18, he announced his candidacy.[35] Capuano ran as a ""Washington insider,"" comparing himself to Kennedy saying: ""was [Kennedy] not the ultimate insider ... I think thats probably one of the best things that we share.[36] In his campaign Capuano received several high-profile endorsements, including House Speaker Pelosi and former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis.[37][38]
Consistently polling below incumbent Massachusetts Attorney General, Martha Coakley, on December 8, 2009 Capuano lost the Democratic primary to Coakley, winning only 28% of the vote to Coakley's 47%, amongst a field of four candidates.
Capuano considered running for Governor of Massachusetts in 2014.[39] On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts and member of the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: ""while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [Democratic] nomination [for Governor] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy.""[40] When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for Governor, Capuano responded: ""Part of me thinks that some of the more interesting, more important fights over the next several years might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill.""[41] In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for Governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. His decision was attributed to his loss against Martha Coakley in the Democratic primary for Senate, virtually closing any possibility for running for higher office.[42]
Capuano was named after his two grandfathers,[2] and has seven siblings, one of whom died in childbirth and another died of polio at the age of 5.[1] Capuano married Barbara Teebagy in 1974, and together they have two boys, Michael and Joseph.[3] He is the uncle of actors Chris Evans of the Fantastic Four and Captain America film series, and Scott Evans of the soap opera One Life to Live.[43] In 2003 the City of Somerville dedicated a new school in Capuano's honor; the Michael E. Capuano Early Childhood Center officially opened in September that year.[44]"

Boston College Law School","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Lynch_(politician)","Stephen Lynch","Democratic","Massachusetts State Legislature","Roman Catholic","Stephen Francis Lynch (born March 31, 1955) is an American politician who has served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts since 2001. He is a Democrat representing the state's 8th district, which includes the southern fourth of Boston and many of its southern suburbs. Lynch was previously an ironworker and lawyer, and served in both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court.
Born and raised in South Boston, Lynch is the son of an ironworker. He went into the trade after high school, working in an apprenticeship and later joining his father's union. He became the union's youngest president at age 30 while attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology. He received his J.D. from Boston College Law School in 1991.[1] For several years he worked as a lawyer, primarily representing housing project residents and labor unions. Lynch was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, unseating an incumbent Democratic lawmaker, in 1994. His social views and advocacy for the South Boston neighborhood led him to the Massachusetts Senate in 1995, when he won a special election to succeed state Senator William M. Bulger.
He won a special election to represent the state's 9th district in the United States House of Representatives in 2001, and has been re-elected ever since. His district was redrawn into the 8th district in 2013. Lynch has a reputation of being the most socially conservative member of Massachusetts's House delegation, and often votes independently of his party leadership. He currently sits on the Financial Services Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Lynch ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2013 special election for the U.S. Senate but lost to Edward Markey.


Lynch, the fourth of six children, was born March 31, 1955, in the neighborhood of South Boston. He was raised with his five sisters in the Old Colony Housing Project. His father, Francis Lynch, was an ironworker who had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. His mother, Anne (ne Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and South Boston High School. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice ironworker. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the United States for various companies, including General Motors and U.S. Steel.[2][3]
He was arrested in 1977 for smoking marijuana at a Willie Nelson concert at the Illinois State Fair, leading to a $50 misdemeanor fine. He was again arrested in 1979 for assault and battery of six Iranian students at an anti-American protest in Boston, a charge which was later dropped. Around this time, he developed ""a problem with alcohol,"" leading him to join Alcoholics Anonymous. (He reportedly stopped after meeting his future wife several years later, although he continued to attend occasional meetings through the 2000s.)[4][5]
Having personal experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston.[2] In the early 1980s Lynch was elected to the executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.[2]
That year he led a three-week labor strike, refusing to sign a contract with the Associated General Contractors, despite pressure from within his union. The union international ultimately signed the contract without Lynch's approval, causing him to file suit against them. He would later remark, with regard to his political career, ""Nothing I ever do will be as volatile as being union president during those times.""[2] This debacle forced him to miss the first three weeks of classes at Boston College Law School, where he had enrolled. Despite the setback, he graduated with a J.D. in 1991. After graduating he joined the law office of Gabriel O. Dumont, Jr., representing labor unions and unemployed workers.[2]
Throughout law school and the following years, he often worked pro bono, representing housing project residents at Boston Housing Authority (BHA) hearings.[2] In one high-profile 1994 case, Lynch provided free legal services to 14 teenagers, all white, who were accused of physically attacking a Hispanic teenager and harassing the family of his white girlfriend over a period of six months. Lynch, who claimed the youths had been ""overcharged,"" helped some of the teenagers to avoid criminal charges and eviction by the BHA.[6][7][8]
Lynch was a one-time tax delinquent.[9] In the mid-1980s the city of Boston placed liens on four properties he owned due to several thousand dollars of unpaid property taxes. He owed $2,000 in overdue taxes to the state of Massachusetts from 1985 to 1998, and for several years owed $4,000 to the federal IRS.[10]
With numerous cases under his belt, Lynch developed a reputation in the community, and was encouraged by friends to run for office. In early 1994 he phoned Paul J. Gannon, the Democratic state representative from the 4th Suffolk district, to announce a run against him.[2] While both candidates were labor advocates with similar backgrounds, Lynch described himself as ""the conservative candidate"". He criticized Gannon for not supporting the Veterans Council, which had prevented a gay rights group from marching in the local St. Patrick's Day Parade.[11] Lynch's base of supporters in the projects allowed him to win the Democratic primary by 600 votes, and he continued to a victory in the November 1994 general election.[2]
As a state representative, he was a vocal advocate for his neighborhood. He opposed a plan by Governor William Weld and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to construct a $200 million football stadium by the publicly owned South Boston waterfront.[12] He led the opposition to a proposed asphalt plant in South Bay, and sponsored an amendment to a state bond bill which banned the plant's construction.[13]
When the President of the Massachusetts Senate, William M. Bulger, announced his resignation from his 1st Suffolk seat in late 1995, Lynch filed nomination papers for the special election to replace him. Bulger's son, attorney William M. Bulger, Jr. ran for the seat. Another lawyer, Patrick Loftus, also ran for the Democratic primary.[14] The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect.[15] Lynch won the Democratic primary in March 1996, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56%-35%-9%.[14][16] In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96%-4% and was inaugurated on May 1, 1996.[17][18][19] He won re-election unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.[20]
As a state senator, Lynch continued to lead opposition to the proposed football stadium[21] and was a vocal opponent of a proposal to sell the publicly owned Marine Industrial Park.[22] He opposed a hate-crimes bill which would make racially charged language a felony, and harkened back to the 1994 racial violence case as an example. He charged that the bill ""attacks merely words"" and ""prosecutes young people who, in my opinion, haven't developed the responsibility and wisdom to measure their words.""[6] On the Senate Transportation Committee, he cosponsored a bill in June 1996 to allow certain Boston residents unlimited access to the Ted Williams Tunnel.[23] In 1997 he was named Senate Chairman of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor.[24] In response to a budget crisis in the state's nursing homes, due primarily to Medicaid shortfalls, he filed an unsuccessful bill in April 2001 to increase Medicaid funding by $200 million.[25] While in the Senate, Lynch enrolled in Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, from which he graduated with a Master's Degree in 1999.[3]
Lynch announced his candidacy for the 9th district seat in 2001, when longtime incumbent U.S. Representative Joe Moakley, stricken with leukemia, decided not to seek a 17th term the following year. This was a departure from Lynch's previous plan to run for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts.[26] Moakley died in May 2001, before his term ended, and Lynch announced a run for the special election to succeed him.[9] The early frontrunner of the race was lawyer Max Kennedy, son of Democratic U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Political missteps dragged Kennedy down in the polls, and his abrupt departure in June 2001 put Lynch in the lead.[27] The remaining candidates included eight Democrats and two Republicans, all with similar political positions; according to The Boston Globe, the candidates ""struggled to find areas of conflict"" when debating.[28]
In the September Democratic primary, Lynch's main opponents were state Senators Cheryl Jacques, Brian Joyce and Marc Pacheco. During the campaign, Lynch faced criticism as his past improprieties were uncovered, including two arrests, defaulting on student loans, and a long history of tax delinquency.[9] He was attacked by gay rights advocates for ""a history of supporting anti-gay legislation.""[29] Despite these setbacks, Lynch maintained strong local support going into the primary.[9] As Lynch pulled ahead in polls and fundraising, Jacques and Joyce attacked his 1994 racial violence case and subsequent positions on hate crime as evidence that he was not supportive of civil rights.[7][8][28]
On September 11, 2001, Lynch won the Democratic primary with 39% of the vote, 10 points ahead of Jacques, who ranked second with 29% of the vote.[30][31] The same day, the September 11 attacks took place, which dampened the ensuing general election campaign between Lynch and the Republican nominee, state Senator Jo Ann Sprague. As both sides turned to similar themes of patriotism and defense, Lynch benefited from the demographics of his district. On October 16, he defeated Sprague 65%-33%.[9][32]
He was sworn into the 107th Congress on October 23, 2001. The ceremony had been delayed for a weekend, as the 2001 anthrax attacks had led to a shutdown of Congressional office buildings. In a press conference after his swearing-in, Lynch remarked on the unlikelihood of his career path, comparing himself to Jed Clampett of The Beverly Hillbillies.[33]
Lynch is a conservative Democrat by Massachusetts standards, but a moderately liberal one by national standards. He generally votes conservative on social issues and liberal on economic and environmental issues. ""Calling me the least liberal member from Massachusetts is like calling me the slowest Kenyan in the Boston Marathon,"" he remarked in 2010. ""It's all relative.""[34] He is strongly pro-labor and has focused on bringing manufacturing jobs to his district.[35] He is a co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus.[36]
Committee assignments
Lynch has been a member of the House Financial Services Committee since his first term.[38] According to CQ, Lynch supported President George W. Bush's agenda one-third of the time, which was average for Democratic House members.[8] For instance, he supported the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which addressed the subprime mortgage crisis, but opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[39] He has supported President Barack Obama's economic agenda, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.[39][40]
Lynch has focused on trade policy as a congressman.[41] In 2002 he voted against fast track bills which gave the president the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress.[8] In 2007 he voted in favor of the United States  Peru Trade Promotion Agreement despite some Democratic opposition.[42]
Lynch has sat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, formerly called the Government Reform Committee, throughout his House career.[38] He chaired the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Post Office, and the District of Columbia from 2009 to 2010. On this subcommittee he has dealt with federal employee recruitment, salary, and benefits.[44]
Lynch is an advocate for health care reform but split with his party on Obama's health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House's health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch stated that he would oppose the PPACA until ""they put reform back in the health reform bill.""[45] He described the Senate bill as a ""surrender"" to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs, and that did not represent meaningful reform. He explained, ""There's a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender of all the things that people thought were important to health care reform.""[46] When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.[47]
On social issues, Lynch is considered a conservative to moderate Democrat.[48] He is pro-life[48] and has been attacked by pro-choice group NARAL.[49] He sided with conservatives in the 2005 Terri Schiavo case, voting for federal court intervention in the case.[50] He has sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, however, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees.[48] He supports same-sex marriage.[51]
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee had oversight of airport security and some elements of the United States' War in Afghanistan.[52] Lynch sat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his first term.[38] Lynch, who has several Veterans's Affairs (VA) hospitals in his district, sponsored legislation to increase nurse staffing and to allow private physician prescriptions to be filled at VA hospitals.[8]
A supporter of American intervention in the Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq and a total of ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan.[53] Part of the purpose of these visits was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects.[39] He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war.[39] He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011.[53] He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative.[53] Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.[54]
Lynch supports lifting the United States' economic sanctions on Cuba. Moakley, his predecessor, was heavily involved in Latin American affairs, and Lynch has made an effort to continue this work. He joined five other congressmen on a 2002 visit to Cuba, where they met with President Fidel Castro.[8]
Lynch won re-election unopposed in 2002, 2004, and 2008. In 2006, Republican perennial candidate Jack E. Robinson III decided to challenge Lynch, and was defeated 78%-22%.[55] After voting against the Affordable Care Act, he was challenged in the 2010 Democratic primary by Mac D'Alessandro, a first-time candidate for office. D'Alessandro served as the New England political director for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which spent almost $300,000 on direct mail and other support for him. The Boston Globe also endorsed D'Alessandro. In September, Lynch defeated him 65%35%.[56][57][58] In November, he defeated Republican Vernon Harrison 68%26%.[59] After redistricting, Lynch decided to run in the newly redrawn Massachusetts's 8th congressional district in the 2012 election. His new district includes the city of Quincy, Massachusetts and some other towns on the South Shore. In November, he defeated Republican Joe Selvaggi 76%24%.[60]
Upon the death of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts state law triggered a special election to be held in January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers to run in the special election.[61] After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.[62]
Lynch announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on January 31, 2013, seeking to fill the seat then held by John Kerry, who resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State.[63] Lynch's candidacy in the 2013 special election had been portrayed as an uphill battle against liberal Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, who boasted a larger war chest and several major party endorsements.[64] A Politico profile compared Lynch's ""common-man touch"" and moderate views to that of Republican Scott Brown, who won an unlikely Senate bid three years earlier by connecting with independent voters.[64] Lynch lost to Markey in the April 30 Democratic primary.[65]
Lynch dated Margaret Shaughnessy for 10 years before the two married in 1992. Shaughnessy, an aide to state Senator Marian Walsh, was from another South Boston family, one of seven children, and majored in graphic design at the Massachusetts College of Art. She had gone to high school with Lynch's sisters, and she and Lynch were members of the South Boston Residents Group.[2][66] As of 2010[update], Stephen and Margaret Lynch live in South Boston with their daughter Victoria Bailey Lynch and a niece, Crystal Shaughnessy.[3][66][67]
Along with his wife, Lynch is a Roman Catholic, which he says ""sets the moral compass"" for his political beliefs. He prefers not to publicize his faith politically, saying, ""I don't want to appear as someone who's preaching, or come off as ... 'Holier than thou.'""[2]"

Suffolk University Law School","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Keating","Bill Keating","Democratic","Massachusetts House of Representatives, Massachusetts Senate, Norfolk County District Attorney","Roman Catholic","William Richard ""Bill"" Keating (born September 6, 1952) is an American politician who has served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts since 2011. He is a Democrat representing the state's 9th district, which includes Cape Cod and the South Coast. Keating raised his profile advocating for criminal justice issues in the state legislature before becoming district attorney (DA) of Norfolk County, where he served three terms prior to his election to Congress.
Born and raised in Norwood, Massachusetts, Keating ""took a traditional route to politics,""[2] attending Boston College and Suffolk University Law School. As a resident of Sharon he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1976 and went on to serve in the state Senate from 1985 to 1999. He authored numerous bills signed into law concerning taxation, drug crime, and sentencing reform. His attempted overthrow of Senate President William M. Bulger in 1994 was a failure but boosted his local name recognition, which contributed to his success in the 1998 election for DA.
Keating followed the path of former Norfolk District Attorney Bill Delahunt to Congress, winning election in 2010 to represent the 10th district. In 2012, after redistricting combined his district with that of fellow incumbent Stephen Lynch, Keating chose to run in the ""incumbent-free"" 9th district, where he was elected to a second term. As of the 113th Congress (20132014), Keating sits on the House Homeland Security Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee. Much of his work has focused on domestic issues central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.
Keating was born in Norwood, Massachusetts in 1952 to Anna (ne Welch) and William B. Keating. Graduating from Sharon High School, Keating enrolled in Boston College where he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1974, and his Masters of Business Administration in 1982. In 1985 Keating earned his Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School and passed the bar exam. Keating later became a partner at the law firm of Keating & Fishman.[3][4]
In 1977 Keating was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives from the 19th Norfolk district, where he served for a year, and was later elected from the 8th Norfolk district, serving from 1979 to 1984.[3][5] He was a supporter of George Keverian in his successful 1985 effort to overthrow Thomas W. McGee as Speaker of the House.[2] By the end of his House tenure, Keating became vice chairman of the House Criminal Justice Committee.[6]
In 1984, state Sen. Joseph F. Timilty resigned his Norfolk and Suffolk seat to pursue a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced Republican Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the Ronald Reagan campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator.[6] He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.[7]
In his first year he was named Senate chairman of the joint Public Safety Committee, where he led the legislative action for a statewide seat belt law pushed by Governor Michael Dukakis.[8] He authored a drug sentencing reform package signed into law in 1988, lowering thresholds for possession charges and establishing new minimum sentences, including a one-year minimum sentence for first-time possession of cocaine or PCP ""with intent to distribute"".[9] The latter provision was widely derided by criminal justice authorities as excessively strict and vaguely worded.[10]
Redistricting eventually placed Keating in the Norfolk and Bristol seat (19891994).[3][5] As a vice chairman of the joint Criminal Justice Committee, Keating was a lead author of a 1991 sentencing reform bill, signed into law by Governor William Weld, that made it easier to try juveniles as adults and pass harsher sentences in the case of major crimes, especially murder. ""What is occurring is a shift away from the rehabilitative stance to a focus on the seriousness of the crime committed by the juvenile,"" said Keating.[11][12] In 1992, as co-chairman of the Taxation Committee, he successfully pushed a proposal to phase out the Massachusetts estate tax.[13][14]
In 1994 Keating led a group of liberals in a failed coup to remove state Senate President William Bulger, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal relative to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies.[2] Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: ""The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, is something that is resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent.""[15]
Further redistricting landed Keating in the Norfolk, Bristol, and Plymouth district from 1995 to 1998.[3][5] Throughout his Senate tenure, Keating served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Taxation, and Vice Chairman of the Committee on Criminal Justice; he also served as the Senate Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety and Chairman of the Steering and Policy Committee.[4]
Speculation emerged in early 1997 that Keating was planning a run for district attorney (DA) of Norfolk County.[16] He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength, while the other candidates pointed to his lack of courtroom experience as a disqualifier. While Keating held a part-time law practice during his legislative career, he lacked exposure to the criminal cases handled by the DA's office.[17] After winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. Locke, a Republican, had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after the resignation of Bill Delahunt. With years of experience as a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55 percent of the vote.[18]
Upon taking office in January 1999, he immediately replaced two top officials, and one-third of the remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials.[19][20] In his first year he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, in an effort to reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit.[19] In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties,[21] and it was fully established the following year.[22] Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001.[23] In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.[24]
In advance of the 2002 elections, he was seen as a likely contender to succeed deceased Rep. Joe Moakley in the U.S. House of Representatives, but he opted to run for a second term as DA instead,[25] and was unopposed for re-election.[26] He won a third term, still unopposed, in 2006.[27]
With incumbent U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt choosing to retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order to run for Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy.[28] On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary.[29] Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In the wake of the Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character.[30] With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents, in the November 2 election.[31]
With the state poised to lose a congressional seat after the 2010 census, lawmakers released a redistricting plan in November 2011 that placed Keating into the same congressional district as Stephen Lynch.[32] Under the plan, the cities of Quincy and other upper South Shore towns were placed into Lynch's district, potentially forcing a primary between the two lawmakers. Rather than challenge Lynch, Keating chose to move to his summer home on Cape Cod in order to run in an ""incumbent-free"" district. Keating defeated Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter in the September 6 Democratic primary, and in November 2012 he defeated Republican Christopher Sheldon to win a second term in the U.S. House.
Keating is considered a liberal by national standards. In 2012, the National Journal ranked Keating as ""the 84th most liberal member of the House,"" but second only to Stephen Lynch as the most conservative of the Massachusetts House delegation.[33]
Issues specific to his South Coast and Cape Codbased district, such as maritime policy, have been a major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address fisheries management concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders.[34] In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid.[35] In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.[36]
When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission considered a 20-year contract extension for the Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station in Plymouth in mid-2012, Keating repeatedly took to the press. He at first declined to take a position on the plant's re-authorization, stating, ""I wouldn't be the right person to ask and that's why we have regulatory authorities and people with expertise to deal with that.""[37] When the commission voted to renew the license, Keating joined other Massachusetts politicians in deriding the decision as premature.[38] During a labor strike later in the year, Keating joined U.S. Representative Ed Markey in challenging the qualifications of the plant's replacement workers.[39]
Along with U.S. Senator John Kerry, Keating helped to finalize the cleanup and sale of portions of a defunct naval air base in South Weymouth to private developers. The deal, reached in November 2011, was a linchpin for the SouthField development project.[40]
Keating has stressed his opposition to Social Security reductions such as raising the retirement age or privatizing the program,[41][42] and supported a cost-of-living adjustment announced by the Social Security Administration in 2011.[43]
In 2011, Keating had a 100% voting record with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFLCIO), backing all 29 endorsed bills.[44] During 2012, Keating voted in favor of 10 of 12 AFL-CIO backed bills, with the two opposing votes dealing with small business startups and swap dealer exclusions.[44] Overall, Keating's has support 95% of AFL-CIO endorsed legislation. Keating also received an 0% rating from the anti-union WorkPlaceChoice.org.[44] He voted ""nay"" on the NLRB Prohibitions Bill in November 2011.[45]
Keating sits on the House Homeland Security Committee as well as the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he is the ranking member of the Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats Subcommittee. He joined a Congressional delegation to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, shortly after the 2011 execution of Osama Bin Laden.[47] After TSA officers in Boston were accused of racial profiling in 2012, he requested a Homeland Security Committee hearing into the accusations.[48]
A Women's Advisory Board for the 10th Congressional District was founded by Keating in January 2011, with hopes of gaining insight into how best to serve the women in the 10th District.[49] From October 18 to October 21, 2011, he hosted ""Women's Week"" in the district, with events focusing on topics such as breast cancer awareness, domestic violence, and female entrepreneurship.[50]
Keating is pro-choice,[42] and during his tenure in the House has voted against the Protect Life Act and the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.[51] In 2010, Keating received a rating of 0% from Massachusetts Citizens for Life. In 1997, he was rated 100% by NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts, and during the same year, he received a 100% rating from the Massachusetts National Organization for Women.[52]
Keating is a supporter of gay rights. He supported ending the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy and has promised to push nationwide anti-discrimination laws and marriage rights for gays and lesbians.[42] In July 2011, he recorded a video supporting LGBT youth in Massachusetts in conjunction with other members of Massachusetts' Congressional Delegation and the It Gets Better Project.[53]
During his 2010 campaign for the United States House, he promised to increase federal firearm regulations.[54] His proposed changes included closing a loophole that allows people on the FBI Terrorist Watch List to buy guns and requiring child safety trigger locks on all guns sold in the US.[54] Keating voted ""nay"" on a bill to require any state offering right-to-carry permits to recognize such permits issued in other states.[55]
Keating and Rep. Aaron Schock jointly introduced the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act (H.R. 1814; 113th Congress) on April 29, 2013. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage.[56] Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption if they went on to later use healthcare.[57] Schock and Keating wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, ""we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse.""[57]
Keating and his wife Tevis live in Bourne, Massachusetts. They have two children: Kristen and Patrick.[3]"

Benishek was born in Iron River, Michigan in 1952, the son of Helen (ne Kovaleski) and Joseph Benishek. Three of his paternal great-grandparents were Bohemian (Czech) immigrants, while his maternal grandparents were Polish immigrants.[3] His father was killed in local iron mines in 1957, so Benishek was raised by his widowed mother and extended family. He worked in the family business, the Iron River Hotel, until he went to college. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1974 with a degree in biology. From there, he graduated from Wayne State University School of Medicine in 1978. Prior to his election to Congress, he was a general surgeon in the Dickinson County Healthcare System.[4]
Benishek formally announced his candidacy for Congress on March 16, 2010, running against incumbent Democrat Bart Stupak.[4] Stupak's vote in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act fueled an outpouring of support for Benishek, who had no Internet presence aside from a basic website on the day the bill was passed. He received more than $50,000 in unsolicited donations in the first 48 hours after Stupak's vote for the bill on March 21, 2010.[5][6] ""It's amazing, I just can't believe it,"" he said regarding the support he has gotten. ""I need to use this momentum to repeal this health care bill and I'm going to do it. We're going to take over, the Republicans are going to regain the House of Representatives and we're going to repeal this health care bill.""[7] The American Spectator called him ""The Most Popular Republican in America"" on March 21, in the wake of Stupak's yea vote.[8] Stupak announced his retirement on April 9, 2010.[9][10] Benishek won the Republican primary against State Senator Jason Allen by 15 votes.[11]
On November 2, 2010, in the general election, Dan Benishek defeated Democratic nominee State Representative Gary McDowell, Independent Glenn Wilson, Libertarian Keith Shelton, Green Ellis Boal, and UST Patrick Lambert. Benishek was sworn into office on January 5, 2011, as a member of the 112th United States Congress; he succeeded Bart Stupak.[12]
Benishek faced re-election against McDowell in the 2012 election cycle. A September 20, 2012 Public Policy Polling poll showed the race as a statistical dead heat, with McDowell leading Benishek 44% to 42%.[13] Benishek was re-elected by a margin of 2,297 votes, less than 1% of the total votes cast.[14] Benishek endorsed Herman Cain in the 2012 Republican presidential primary.[15]
Benishek's opponent for the 2014 midterm elections was Democratic nominee Jerry Cannon.[16] In October 2014, the Rothenberg Political Report moved the district from one that ""tilts Republican"" to one that is now ""Republican favored.""[17] Benishek won re-election with 52.1% of the vote.
On January 4, 2013, Benishek introduced H.R. 163, a bill identical to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act (S. 23; 113th Congress), which was introduced into the U.S. Senate by Carl Levin.[18] The bill would designate as wilderness about 32,500 acres of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in the state of Michigan. The newly designated lands and inland waterways would comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.[19] Benishek expressed his pleasure that the bill ""was developed locally,"" describing it as ""the ideal way federal land management should occur, with input from the local communities.""[20] The Senate version, S. 23, passed the Senate and was signed into law by President Obama on March 13, 2014.
On May 21, 2013, Benishek introduced the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013 (H.R. 2072; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the Inspector General (IG) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take additional action if the VA has not appropriately responded to an IG report that recommends actions to be taken by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to address a VA public health or safety issue.[21] The Secretary would be required to act swiftly on such IG reports, with the bill specifying actions to take.[21] The Secretary would also be forbidden from giving any bonuses to managers with unresolved issues.[21][22] Benishek said that the bill targets ""bureaucrats in Washington who drag their feet and don't do their jobs.""[22]
Benishek favors reduced government spending and a smaller government, and is pro-life and pro-gun rights.[23] He supports term limits and said before he was elected in 2010, ""I am happy to tell voters I strongly favor term limits. Three terms and youre retired seems about right to me."" He was also a signatory to a pledge by U.S. Term Limits that would impose a three-term limit on Congressmen.[24] In healthcare reform, he supports tort reform and allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines without federal regulation.[25] He opposes federal funding for elective abortions.[26] He supports lower taxes and increased border security.[27] Benishek dismisses the scientific consensus on climate change.[28][29][30]
Benishek lives with his wife Judy in Iron County. They have five children. They also have four grandchildren.[31]"

Huizenga[1] (born January 31, 1969) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 2nd congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009.


Huizenga is the current co-owner and operator of Huizenga Gravel Company, a third generation business located in Jenison, Michigan. He has been affiliated with it for most of his life.[citation needed]
In the early 1990s, Huizenga obtained his Michigan Real Estate sales license, and he quickly became one of the most successful realtors in southwest Michigan.[citation needed] He left real estate in 1996 when he was recruited by U.S. Congressman Peter Hoekstra to be his Director of Public Policy. For six years, from 1996 through 2002, Huizenga traveled up and down western Michigan becoming familiar with the various towns and cities, and eventually decided to run for political office.
Starting with his first election in 2002, Huizenga represented the 90th district for three terms, by winning re-election in 2004 and 2006. After the 2006 election he was term limited. The district is located in Ottawa County and includes the cities of Holland, Zeeland, Hudsonville, and the four townships of Blendon Township, Jamestown Township, Holland Township, and Zeeland Township.
Bill Huizenga voted for the initial version of the Michigan Business Tax, but opposed the 22% surcharge and a sales and services tax later in the process.[2]
Huizenga is the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 2nd congressional district, defeating Democratic nominee Fred Johnson in the general election. 64% of the ballots were cast for Huizenga, and 32% were cast for Johnson.[3] The district is rated ""Solid Republican"" by The New York Times,[4] and simply marked as an ""Open Seat"" according to The Washington Post,[5] though it hasn't elected a Democrat since 1964.
After serving 18 years, Republican incumbent Peter Hoekstra retired to run for the Republic nomination in in the 2010 Michigan Gubernatorial race. Hoekstra failed to win the nomination and then, in 2012, ran for the US Senate and was defeated by incumbent Debbie Stabenow. Huizenga defeated Jay Riemersma, State Senator Wayne Kuipers, Businessman Bill Cooper, and three others in the party primary election on August 3, 2010.[6]
In 2012, Huizenga was reelected to the U.S. House, defeating Willie German Jr. of the Democratic Party, Mary Buzuma of the Libertarian Party, Ronald Graeser of the U.S. Taxpayers Party and William Opalicky of the Green Party.
On September 28, 2013, Huizenga introduced the Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 (H.R. 3211; 113 Congress), a bill that would direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to amend its regulations related to qualified mortgages to reflect new exclusions made by this bill.[7][8]
Huizenga has served as his church's representative to Michigan Right to Life for the last 9 years. Huizenga has been endorsed for the 2010 general election by a number of groups including the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce, Michigan Chamber of Commerce, The NRA, NFIB, Right to Life, FRC, The National Association of Realtors, The Young Guns Vanguard and the Michigan Farm Bureau.[9]
Huizenga and his wife have five children and live in Zeeland.
Huizenga was the recipient of the West Michigan chapter of the Alzheimers Associations 2000 Advocate of the Year Award, the Michigan Manufacturers Association 2003 Advocate of the Year award, the Michigan Manufacturers Association 2005 Legislator of the Year Award, the Michigan Hotel and Motel Association 2007 Tourism Legislator of the Year award, the DADS and MOMS of Michigan 2007 Legislator of the Year Award, and the Michigan Aggregates Association 2007 Legislator of the Year Award.

Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and raised in Kentwood, Michigan, Amash is a second-generation Arab-American of Palestinian Christian and Syrian Greek Orthodox descent.[9] His father is a Palestinian business owner, whose family emigrated to the United States in 1956[10] through the sponsorship of a Christian pastor and his family. His mother is a Syrian immigrant to the United States.[11]
Amash attended Kelloggsville Christian School in Kelloggsville and graduated as class valedictorian from Grand Rapids Christian High School. He graduated from the University of Michigan magna cum laude with a B.A. in Economics and earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School in 2005.[12] Amash admires economists F. A. Hayek and Frdric Bastiat.[13] Amash is married and the father of three children. He belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.[14]
After graduating from the University of Michigan, he became a consultant to his family's tool business. He worked as a corporate attorney for his family's business for a year, before being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008.[15][16]
Amash ran for the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008 in Michigan's 72nd House District. During this time, he donated to the campaigns of Congressman Ron Paul and John McCain.[17] In the Republican primary, he won a five candidate election with 41% of the vote, defeating opponent Ken Yonker by 723 votes, a 6.3% margin. The incumbent, Glenn D. Steil, Jr., did not run because of term limits.[18] In the general election, Amash defeated Democrat Albert Abbasse 61%36%.[19]
During his initial tenure in the State House, Amash sponsored 5 resolutions and 12 bills, but none of them passed.[20] He used his social media Facebook page to report on his floor votes and explain his reasoning. Amash was noted for his attendance record.[21]
In its October 25, 2010, issue, Amash was named one of Time magazine's ""40 under 40  Rising Stars of U.S. Politics"".[22] At the age of 30, Amash was the youngest federal candidate in the United States on the list of new civic leaders.[13]
On August 3, 2010, Amash won the five-way Republican primary for the seat vacated by retiring Republican Vern Ehlers with over 40% of the vote. He was also endorsed by the Club for Growth,[23] Ron Paul,[24] and FreedomWorks PAC[25] during his primary campaign.
During the general election, Amash campaigned on a conservative platform.[12] Amash defeated Democrat Patrick Miles Jr. 60%37% in 2010.[26]
Amash won re-election to the U.S. House in 2012 for his second term, defeating Steve Pestka 53%44%.[27][28]
After initial speculation that he might run for the U.S. Senate, Amash confirmed that he would run for re-election to the House of Representatives in 2014.[29][30] Amash was endorsed by the fiscally conservative Club for Growth PAC, which spent over $500,000 supporting Amash in his Republican primary against former East Grand Rapids School Trustee Brian Ellis, who was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and spent more than $1 million of his own money on the race.[31][32][33]
After Amash defeated Ellis in the August primary, with 57.4% of the vote to Ellis' 42.6%, Amash was highly critical of Ellis and former congressman Pete Hoekstra, who had backed Ellis. About Hoekstra, Amash said, ""You are a disgrace. And I'm glad we could hand you one more loss before you fade into total obscurity and irrelevance."" He also took exception to one of Ellis' television ads that quoted California Republican Congressman Devin Nunes calling Amash ""Al Qaeda's best friend in Congress,"" demanding an apology from Ellis for running what he called a ""disgusting, despicable smear campaign.""[34][35] Amash voted against reauthorizing the Patriot Act, favors the repeal of indefinite detention, and opposed reauthorizing the FISA Amendments Act.[8]
In the general election, Amash defeated Democrat Bob Goodrich and Green Party candidate Tonya Duncan with 58% of the vote.
Conor Friedersdorf, writing for The Atlantic, called Amash ""one of the most important civil libertarians in the House of Representatives"".[8] Tim Murphy wrote in Mother Jones: ""Karl Rove calls him a 'liberal Republican'; Democrats insist his fiscal policy makes Paul Ryan look like a New Dealer; some in the GOP establishment just straight up say he's an asshole.""[11] In December 2012, conservative Representative Lynn Westmoreland, who is close to Republican Party leaders, speaking of why Amash and another congressman who complained that they were unfairly targeted for their conservative votes and excluded from choice positions on powerful committees, said that the asshole factor came into play in the decision.[36][37][38]
Amash has been noted for his attendance. Through 2012, he made every congressional vote.[39] Some congressional Republicans have accused Amash of grandstanding.[40]
Amash supports free markets with limited government regulation. He advocates for economic freedom and believes that stimulus programs and government bailouts are ineffective ways to energize the economy. He also supports adopting a flat tax instead of having targeted tax breaks and subsidies. Amash opposes central economic planning which he believes contributes to unemployment, inflation, and dangerous business cycles.[13] Amash was one of four Republicans who joined 161 Democrats to oppose a Constitutional amendment that would require a yearly balanced budget, due to serious concerns with that specific proposal.[41] Earlier that year, Amash had introduced H.J.Res. 81, an alternative balanced budget amendment that addressed those concerns.[42] He believes that the federal government is improperly expanding its powers using the General Welfare, Commerce, or Necessary and Proper clauses.
Amash supports decreasing U.S. military spending, and believes there is significant waste in the military spending of the U.S. Department of Defense.[43] He believes that only Congress has the power to declare war, criticizing President Obama's attacks on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and his contemplated attack on Syria without Congressional approval.[44][45]
In 2011, Amash was one of only 6 congressmen who voted ""No"" on what Politico described as ""a pedestrian pro-Israel resolution"", House Resolution 268 reaffirming the US commitment to a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, which passed with 407 members in support.[10][46] In 2014, he was one of only 8 congressmen who voted ""No"" on a $225 million package to restock Israel's Iron Dome missile defenses, which passed with 398 members in support.[47] He supports a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.[10]
Amash joined 104 Democrats and 16 Republicans in voting against the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which specified the budget and expenditures of the US Department of Defense.[48] He called it one of the most anti-liberty pieces of legislation of our lifetime.[49] Amash co-sponsored an amendment to the NDAA that would ban indefinite military detention and military trials so that all terror suspects arrested in the United States would be tried in civilian courts. He expressed concern that individuals charged with terrorism could be jailed for prolonged periods of time without ever being formally charged or brought to trial.[50]
Amash is a frequent critic of the National Security Agencys anti-terrorism surveillance tactics.[11][51][52]
He believes health insurance should not be mandatory, and he supports free market health care reforms that include interstate competition among insurance companies and increased access to health savings accounts.[13] He considers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be an overreach of the federal government's powers and supports efforts to repeal it.
Amash wants decreased federal intervention in energy-related issues. He wants to eliminate government-sponsored subsidies for energy production and decrease overall regulation. He believes that no form of energy production should be specially favored or restricted. In addition, Amash supports minimizing federal environmental regulations. He voted in favor of the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 which would have prevented the EPA from putting taxes on greenhouse gases.[53]
Amash is considered pro-life, and generally opposes abortion and the use of federal funding for abortion.[54] He supports a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act as per his Twitter account, stating that the ""real threat"" to traditional marriage and religious liberty is government, and not gay couples.[54][55] Although Amash opposes government funding for abortion, he voted ""present"", rather than ""yes"" or ""no"" on the 2011 Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act, a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood. He explained, Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional.[56] When the New York Times asked him to explain his approach to voting on legislation, he replied, I follow a set of principles, I follow the Constitution. And that's what I base my votes on. Limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty.[56]
He endorsed Ron Paul for President in 2012. Paul's brother, David, was an assistant pastor in Amash's district and endorsed Amash, saying the Michigan congressman shares common ground with Paul.[40][57]
The House Republican Steering Committee removed Amash from the Budget Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.[58][59] He joined Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and David Schweikert of Arizona in a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, demanding to know why they had lost their ""plum"" committee posts.[60]
Politico quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia as explaining that Amash, Huelskamp and Schweikert were removed for ""their inability to work with other members."" The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland ""said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]."" The three were described by Politico and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as ""jerks"" who ""made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team"".[61][62]:p.2"

He is a member of the Democratic Party.
Throughout his career, Kildee has served both as an elected official and a CEO of a national non-profit organization. From 1984 to 2009, he served in a couple of county-level elected positions, as a Genesee County Commissioner and Genesee County Treasurer. He was elected to the United States Congress on November 6, 2012 as the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 5th district. He succeeded his uncle Dale Kildee, who represented Flint in the House of Representatives for 36 years. He resides in Flint Township, Michigan.[1]


Kildee was born in 1958 in Flint, Michigan. He attended Flint Northern High School and Central Michigan University. In 2008, he finished his course work at CMU earning a B.S. in Community Development Administration. He took courses in philosophy and community administration.[2][3]
At the age of 18, Kildee became one of the youngest elected officials in the nation when he was elected to the Flint Board of Education in 1977.[4]
In 1984, he was elected to serve on the Genesee County Board of Commissioners, where he subsequently served for 12 years, including five as board chairman.[5] As chairman of the board, Kildee led the effort to form the Bishop International Airport Authority.[citation needed]
In 1991, he ran to become Mayor of Flint. He was one of four candidates to challenge incumbent Mayor Matthew Collier in the August 6 nonpartisan primary election. City Councilman Woodrow Stanley ranked first with 24% of the vote. Collier ranked second with 23% of the vote, qualifying for the November election. Kildee ranked third with 18%.[6]
In 1996, Kildee was elected as Genesee County Treasurer. He was re-elected in 2000, 2004, and 2008. He won re-election to 2008 with 72% of the Vote.[7] During his tenure as treasurer, he oversaw the county's credit rating and presided over five bond-rating upgrades for the county.[citation needed]
In 2002, he founded the Genesee County Land Bank, a first of its kind in the nation governmental authority dedicated to the issue of urban decay in cities such as Flint, Michigan.[8][9] The land bank has helped to clean up vacant and abandoned structures in the community.[10]
The United States government, non-profit organizations and think tanks have approached Kildee to expand his work to 50 cities identified by the Brookings Institute, focused mostly in the Rust Belt and Northeastern United States, including Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, which have many vacant and abandoned properties.[11]
Most recently in 2009, Kildee co-founded and served as the president of The Center for Community Progress, a national non-profit organization with offices in New Orleans, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.[12][13] Kildee resigned as county treasurer to oversee the Center, intended to reform land sales to stop the spread of blight.[14]
Following an effort to draft him into the 2010 Michigan gubernatorial election,[15] Kildee set up an exploratory committee in February,[16] but shortly thereafter decided not to run.[12]
His uncle, Dale Kildee, served in the United States House of Representatives representing Michigan's 5th congressional district.[17] In July 2011, Dale Kildee announced he would retire from Congress.[18] Dan Kildee declared his candidacy for the House of Representatives on November 1, 2011.[1] He was unchallenged in the Democratic primary. In the November election, he defeated Republican State Representative Jim Slezak 65% to 31%.[18]
In January 2013, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer appointed Kildee to become an assistant whip. His fellow freshmen Democratic members elected Kildee to serve as their representative to the caucus' Steering and Policy Committee.[19] So far during his time in Congress, Congressman Kildee has focused on several issues, including urban development and supporting cities, raising the federal minimum wage, and promoting American manufacturing. He has also been a vocal advocate in Congress pressuring lawmakers to extend emergency unemployment insurance after it expired on Dec. 28, 2013.
Despite being a freshman lawmaker, he was successful in his first six months in office in securing $100 million in federal funds for five Michigan cities, including Flint and Saginaw, so they had resources to tear down vacant, abandoned and run-down properties.[20]
Kildee has also been a strong advocate for the Make it in America initiative, a package of bipartisan bills that have been introduced in the House designed to help create a national manufacturing policy and promote American manufacturing.[21]
Kildee is married to Jennifer Kildee, his wife of 24 years. They have three children, two of whom are currently in college, Kenneth at the University of Michigan-Flint and Katy at Central Michigan University.[18] Dans oldest son Ryan and his wife Ginger are the parents of Dans first and only grandchild, Caitlin.[18][23]"

He is a member of the Republican Party and Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The district stretches along the Michigan-Indiana border in the southwestern part of the state.


Upton was born in St. Joseph, Michigan, the son of Elizabeth B. (ne Vial) and Stephen Edward Upton.[1] Upton earned a B.A. in journalism from the University of Michigan in 1975. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity, Peninsular Chapter and became a sports editor at The Michigan Daily and thought he might someday cover the Chicago Cubs.[2] He served on the congressional staff of U.S. Congressman David Stockman (R-MI) from 1976 to 1980. He was in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1985, while Stockman served as OMB Director.
1986 A protege of OMB director and former U.S. Congressman David Stockman, he ran in Michigan's 4th congressional district against incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Mark Siljander, Stockman's successor. Upton won the Republican primary 55%-45%.[3] He won the general election with 62% of the vote.[4]

2010
Upton was challenged in the Republican primary by former State Representative Jack Hoogendyk. Upton defeated him 57%-43%.[14][15] In the general election, he defeated Cooney in a rematch 62%-34%.[16]
2012
In 2011, Hoogendyk met with the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization, about running against Upton in a rematch in 2012.[17] Upton has been criticized for not being conservative enough by Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, FreedomWorks, Right to Life of Michigan, and the Southwest Michigan Tea Party Patriots.[18] On January 17, 2012, Hoogendyk announced that he would challenge Upton in the primary, the winner of which would face Democrat Mike O'Brien in the general election.[19][20] Upton defeated Hoogendyk in the August 2012 Republican primary, advancing to the general election in November.[21]
While initial polls showed Upton with a sizable lead over the challenger, former marine and businessman Mike O'Brien, a poll in October showed Upton and O'Brien locked in a statistical ""dead-heat"" heading into the final stretch of the campaign.[22][23]
2014
Upton has been a member of moderate Republican factions The Tuesday Group and the Republican Main Street Partnership.[citation needed]
Healthcare Upton voted against passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and has since voted in favor of its complete repeal, stating that the law ignored the will of the people and that a bill that important should not have been passed without strong bipartisan support.[clarification needed] Upton also believes that with the current level of debt, the United States cannot afford the PPACA.[citation needed] In November 2013, in response to Americans losing their health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, Upton proposed a bill what would allow them to retain their health insurance coverage.[24] The essence of the Upton bill is to allow insurance companies to maintain their current individual insurance market policies according to state insurance rules that are in effect as of 2013.[25]
On September 27, 2013, Upton introduced the Drug Quality and Security Act (H.R. 3204; 113th Congress), a bill that would grant the Food and Drug Administration more power to regulate drug compounding in the wake of the New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak.[26] Upton indicated that 3 of those who died were in his district.[27] The bill passed in the House and was being debated in the Senate.
Environment Upton's website once stated: ""I strongly believe that everything must be on the table as we seek to reduce carbon emissions.""[28] In April 2009, he maintained that ""climate change is a serious problem that necessitates serious solutions. Everything must be on the table.""[29] However, ""Upton has gradually retreated from his moderate stance on climate change and carbon emissions.""[28] In late 2010, he co-authored a Wall Street Journal editorial saying he was ""not convinced"" that ""carbon is a problem in need of regulation,"" and urging Congress to overturn Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency. (See Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act)[30] He is the co-sponsor, with Ed Whitfield, of the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011.[31]
Regarding the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act being upheld in Federal Appeals court, Upton said that Congresss refusal to approve greenhouse gas limits constituted a decision and that lawmakers should act now to reverse the United States Environmental Protection Agency emissions rules. Carbon regulation threatens to drive energy prices higher, destroy jobs and hamstring our economic recovery, per Upton. The American automobile industry supports the regulations.[32] Due to his environmental policies, the Los Angeles Times wrote in 2011 that Upton ""represents one of the biggest threats to planet Earth on planet Earth.""[33]
In 2007 Upton was a co-sponsor of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 which among other things mandated phased-in energy efficiency standards for most light bulbs. At the time, Upton noted that the legislation, ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush, would ""help preserve energy resources and reduce harmful emissions, all while saving American families billions of dollars on their electric bills.""[34] But in 2010, after Glenn Beck called Upton ""all socialist"" for supporting the bill,[35] Upton led a failed effort to stop Obama from enforcing the new energy standards.[34]
Energy On October 22, 2013, Upton introduced the North American Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3301; 113th Congress), a bill that would make changes to permitting requirements for pipelines and other energy infrastructure at international borders.[36][37] Upton said that the bill ""is a sincere effort to focus a targeted solution to lessons learned from the Keystone pipeline... No one can rightly argue that the current presidential permit process as the State Department is not broken, no matter what side of the climate debate you're on.""[38] Upton also argued that ""we're creating a fair and transparent approval process for cross-border energy projects, putting them all on a level playing field for the benefit of North American energy security, lower energy prices, and jobs.""[39]
Video game content ratings On September 29, 2006, Upton introduced the Video Game Decency Act (H.R. 6120) to the House during the 109th United States Congress.[40] The bill was introduced and referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, but never received consideration. Upton reintroduced a bill by the same title (H.R. 1531) in the 110th United States Congress, which was also referred to that committee and never received a vote.[41]
Abortion Upton generally supports pro-life legislation.[42]
Gun control Upton does not support restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns in most circumstances, and in 2010 received ""A"" and ""A-"" ratings from the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America, respectively.[citation needed] Upton supports some gun safety laws. From 1991-2003, Upton supported the interests of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence 55 percent and in 1993, Upton supported a waiting period for gun purchase to provide background checks for criminal records.[42]
LGBT issues Upton believes that marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman. Upton voted to propose an amendment to the Constitution regarding the definition of marriage on July 18, 2006.[42] He received a 15% rating from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBT Rights in 2008.[43]
Fiscal issues
Upton supports a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a proposal that failed to acquire the two-thirds support necessary to pass the House in the 112th Congress. Upton also supports the line-item veto, which would authorize the President to propose the rescission of full or partial funding in a bill passed by Congress.
In the 111th session of Congress, Upton tabled $7,225,000 in federal funds through eleven earmarks,[44] but political pressure from inside of the Republican party led Upton to announce his support for a Republican initiative to install a moratorium in Congress on legislative earmarks to reduce unnecessary budget expenditures and the fiscal deficit.[45] According to the Council of Citizens Against Government Waste, a taxpayer watchdog group, Upton refrained from all earmarking activities during the 112th Congress.[46]
Upton has been criticized by the conservative website Human Events for being liberal with regards to fiscal issues.[47] He has been recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with the Spirit of Enterprise award for standing firmly against overreaching regulations and job-destroying mandates.[48]
Upton introduced legislation to reverse the FCC's ruling on Net Neutrality in 2015.
Upton's grandfather, Frederick Upton, was co-founder of appliance manufacturer and marketer Whirlpool Corporation, which is headquartered in Benton Harbor. His wifes name is Amey, and he has two children, Meg and Stephen.[51] Upton's niece is supermodel Kate Upton.[52][53]
Upton is a supporter of Michigan Wolverines athletics as well as an enthusiastic Chicago Cubs baseball fan.[2] He is a member of the Emil Verban Society.[51]"

Wheaton College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walberg","Tim Walberg","Republican","U.S. House","United Brethren","Timothy Lee ""Tim"" Walberg (born April 12, 1951) is the current U.S. Representative for Michigan's 7th congressional district, and was also the former Congressman for the district from 2007 to 2009.


Walberg was born and educated in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.[1] He left a post-high school position with the U.S. Forest Service to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at Western Illinois University and attended Moody Bible Institute, and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a B.A. in religious education from Taylor University. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in New Haven, Indiana, which concluded when he enrolled in the Wheaton College graduate school. After receiving an M.A. in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to Tipton, Michigan, where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the Michigan House of Representatives.
Walberg served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by Doug Spade and the seat is currently held by Dudley Spade, both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois while continuing to live in Michigan.[2]
After six years out of politics, Walberg ran in a field of six candidates in the 2004 Republican primary for the 7th District after six-term incumbent Nick Smith retired. He lost to former State Senator Joe Schwarz, a moderate Republican. Schwarz went on to win in November.
Walberg immediately began gearing up for a rematch against Schwarz in 2006. Walberg defeated Schwarz in the primary by 3,915 votes.[3]
In October 2006, the Walberg campaign's volunteer coordinator pled guilty to child abuse charges.[4] The allegations first appeared in the Jackson Citizen Patriot.[5] According to the Jackson Citizen Patriot, ""Walberg said he knew of the alleged abuse 'on or about Sept. 12'.""[6] The staffer pled guilty to the charges on September 18 and left the campaign after the charges became public in October. Walberg frequently stated the matter was ""private"" and he hoped the best for the family involved.
Walberg's defeat of Schwarz gave the Democrats hope of winning the seat. Although Republicans had held it for decades, the 7th is a somewhat marginal district on paper; it narrowly voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 and voted for George W. Bush almost as narrowly in 2000 and 2004. On the other hand, Schwarz had won the previous election (against the same Democratic opponent) by 22%.
On November 7, 2006, Walberg defeated Democrat Sharon Renier 50%-46%.[7] The Renier campaign spent $46,000[8] to Walberg's $1.2 million[9]
Entering the 2008 race, Walberg was identified by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Chris Van Hollen as one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in congress.[10] On August 23, 2007, State Senate Minority Leader Mark Schauer announced he would challenge Walberg in the 2008 election.[11] The prior occupant of the seat, Joe Schwarz, who was defeated by Walberg in the 2006 Republican primary declined to run himself, but on September 30 endorsed Schauer.[12]
Schauer narrowly defeated Walberg in the November 2008 election. Republican presidential candidate John McCain lost the district to Democrat Barack Obama by nearly 17,000 votes but outperformed Walberg by over 6,000 votes, while Walberg lost to Schauer by 7,432 votes. Between the two candidates, around $3.5 million were spent on the campaign,[13] along with the massive amount spent by independent groups, made it the most expensive House race in the 2008 election.[14]
On July 14, 2009, Walberg announced that he was running for his old congressional seat and challenge Democratic incumbent Mark Schauer. .[15] He defeated Marvin Carlson and Brian Rooney in the Republican primary.
Prior to the election, nonpartisan polling showed the race as a dead heat.[16] Walberg defeated Schauer 50%-45%.[17][18]
Wahlberg defeated Democrat Kurt Haskell 53%-43%.[17]
Walberg has voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.[19]
In March 2007, Walberg was a guest on the Jack Ebling show on WILS-AM. During the broadcast Walberg stated that most of Iraq was as stable as Detroit, Michigan or Harvey, Illinois. Both the offices of the Mayor of Detroit and the Mayor of Harvey released statements requesting an apology from Walberg. ""Unfortunately, for years people have beat up on the city of Detroit. Detroit is the word for negative. We are working very hard to transform that image of our city"", said James Canning, spokesman for the Detroit office of the Mayor. Mayor Kellogg of Harvey stated: ""Even though our country appears to have accomplish(ed) great gains in racial harmony, we still have members of congress who suffer from the highest levels of ignorance and stupidity.""[20]
On August 6, 2007, the Lenawee County Elections Commission approved the wording for Jackson resident James Carr's recall petition.[21] While Michigan laws and constitution allow for recall elections, an attorney for Walberg says there is no provision in the U.S. Constitution for recalling a United States Congressperson and challenged the action in court. On August 28, 2007, Lenawee County Circuit Court Judge Harvey Koselka issued an injunction that prohibited filing signed petitions with the state until a ruling is made on the constitutionality of recalling a member of Congress.[22][23] Carr has since ended his campaign.[24]
On July 23, 2014, Walberg introduced the Senior Executive Service Accountability Act (H.R. 5169; 113th Congress), a bill that would make it less difficult to fire or suspend members of the Senior Executive Service (SES).[25][26]
Walberg is a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Tea Party Caucus.

Levin, a member of the Democratic Party from Michigan, is the ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee; he was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee from 2010 to 2011.
Levin's district includes many of Detroit's northern and northeastern suburbs, such as Mount Clemens, Southfield, Clinton Township, Warren, Fraser, Sterling Heights, Eastpointe and St. Clair Shores. Since 2013, he has represented Michigan's 9th congressional district; previously he represented Michigan's 12th congressional district. He is the older brother of former U.S. Senator Carl Levin.


Levin was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Bess (ne Levinson) and Saul R. Levin. He graduated from Central High School in Detroit, received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1952, a Master's degree in international relations from Columbia University in 1954, and a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1957.
After developing a private law practice, Levin served in the Michigan Senate from 1965 to 1970, and was Senate Minority Leader 19691970. He made unsuccessful campaigns for Governor of Michigan in 1970 and 1974, losing to Republican William Milliken. He was a Fellow of the Harvard Kennedy School in 1975. From 1977 through 1981 he was assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development.
In 1982, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman William Brodhead decided not to run for re-election, instead making an unsuccessful run for governor. Levin won the Democratic primary in Michigan's 17th congressional district with 49% of the vote,[1] which at that time included northwestern Detroit as well as parts of Macomb and Oakland counties. Levin subsequently won this 1982 general election with 67% of the vote.[2] He typically won re-election with at least 56% of the vote since then, exceptions being 1992 and 1994 elections. After the 1990 United States Census, his district was renumbered as the 12th district and lost its share of Detroit. In 1992, he narrowly defeated businessman and Vietnam War veteran John Pappageorge 53%-46%.[3] In a 1994 rematch, Levin again defeated this same opponent, during the midst of the Republican Revolution, 52%-47%.[4] Then again in 1996, Levin defeated Pappageorge by a larger margin in a third rematch 57%-41%.[5] In 1998, Levin won re-election against Republican nominee Leslie A. Touma, 56%-42%.[6] In 2000, Detroit Metro area businessman Bart Baron gained the endorsement of the United Auto Workers Union, but Levin still managed to win re-election with 64% of the vote.[7] The 2000s redistricting added heavily Democratic Southfield and Mount Clemens to the district, and he has won re-election in every election with at least 61% of the vote since then.[8]
After redistricting, Levin was drawn into the same district as fellow U.S. Congressman Gary Peters (D-MI).[9] The district retained Peters' district numberthe 9thbut geographically is more Levin's district. Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District.[10] In 2008, Obama won the 9th district with 59% of the vote, while he won statewide with 57%. Levin now represents the 12th congressional district which picks up Oak Park, Berkley, Madison Heights, Clawson, Royal Oak, and Troy, but former portions were moved over into the adjacent 11th District to the west to now include Southfield Township, Beverly Hills, Bloomfield Township Birmingham, and portions of Royal Oak.[11]
Levin took over as chairman of the Ways and Means committee on March 4, 2010 when Charles B. Rangel of New York stepped aside in due to a number of ethics violations.[12] He served as chairman until January, 2011, and currently serves as the committee's ranking member.
His wife of 50 years, Vicki, died on September 4, 2008. They had four children and ten grandchildren.
In July 2012, Levin married Pamela Cole, age 61, a Pennsylvania State University psychology professor who studies emotional development, in a private ceremony. They met through his late wife Vicki. Cole and Levin worked to create a fund in her name for young professionals researching early childhood development.[13]
Levin comes from a family that has long been prominent in Michigan politics. His younger brother Carl Levin was the state's senior Senator until his retirement in January 2015. His uncle, Theodore, was a federal judge. His first cousin, Charles, was a Michigan Supreme Court justice, after serving as a Michigan Court of Appeals judge. Another first cousin, Joseph Levin, was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. His son, Andy, was the 2006 Democratic candidate for the Michigan Senate in the 13th Senate District, losing in a tight race to John Pappageorge.[14]"

Miller (born May 7, 1954) is the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 10th congressional district, serving since 2003. She is a member of the Republican Party.
The district includes all of Michigan's Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac, and St. Clair counties, plus northern Macomb and eastern Tuscola counties. She is one of only a few members in Congress whose highest level of education is a high school diploma.
Miller is not seeking re-election in 2016.[1]


For the 110th Congress Miller was appointed to continue her service on the House Armed Services Committee and was added to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over not only surface transportation but also water quality issues related to the Great Lakes. Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Homeland Security in March 2008 and has since left the House Armed Services Committee.[citation needed]
During the 108th Congress, the House Ethics Committee sent her letters of admonishment for having improperly attempted to influence the vote of fellow Michigan congressman Nick Smith on the House floor. She later told the Detroit Free Press, "" can be intimidated by an overweight middle-age woman, that's too bad.""[2]
During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Mrs. Miller was a member of the Armed Services committee, and part of a ""war room"" team that relayed information from the Bush administration to Republican members, the news media, and the public.[3]
During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote. ""The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.[4]
The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be ""a threat of retaliation"" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.
Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smiths no vote on the board and she didnt like the way that he voted. Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: Is this how youre going to vote; or, This is how youre going to vote? And he said, Obviously.
Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: Well, I hope your son doesnt come to Congress, or Im not going to support your son, or something to that effect. Representative Smith then rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here. That was the end of the interaction between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote on the Medicare legislation.
Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smiths recollection was that Representative Miller came up and said something like, I havent been involved in this campaign before, but if you dont change your vote, Ill get involved, and Ill make sure Brad isnt elected.[5]
Miller is a signer of Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which commits her to oppose tax increases.[6]
Miller sat on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and has praised President Obama for his stance on off-shore oil exploration.[7] She supports selling oil and gas leases to help fund the research and development of alternative energy projects.[7]
On August 31, 2011, Miller complained about the publication by WikiLeaks (a non-profit document archive organisation) of classified documents purloined from the U. S. Government, The latest release of stolen American secrets by the organization WikiLeaks once again proves that they are a terrorist operation that puts the lives of Americans and our allies at risk. Particularly contemptible and criminal is the release of the identities of sources of information to our nation from those working against despotic regimes or terrorist organizations. WikiLeaks can no longer say that they are anything more than an organization that aids and abets enemies of freedom. It is long past time for the Obama Administration to take decisive action to shut this criminal operation down and to bring those who steal and release Americas secrets and put our allies at risk to justice.[8]
On April 26, 2012, Miller voted for the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. It passed the House of Representatives,[9] but did not become law.
In June 2013, Miller introduced legislation, the Great Lakes Navigation System Sustainability Act of 2013 (H.R. 2273), to redefine how the Great Lakes are treated in the competition for United States government harbor maintenance funding, and to create the opportunity for recreational harbors to vie for federal funding as well.[10]
Miller, along with Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, introduced H.R. 3141, the Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2013. The bill would implement a biometric exit system that would monitor the exit of foreign visitors. The bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a biometric exit system for ten airports and ten seaports, test the system for two years, and then implement the system nationwide.[11][12]
Miller also introduced, on November 14, 2013, H.R. 3487, To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act to extend through 2018 the authority of the Federal Election Commission to impose civil money penalties on the basis of a schedule of penalties established and published by the Commission, to expand such authority to certain other violations, and for other purposes.[13] The bill would allow the FEC to continue to use a fee schedule to impose small fines on things such as late filings.[14]
On January 10, 2014, Miller introduced the United States Customs and Border Protection Authorization Act (H.R. 3846; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its mission and direct the CBP in the United States Department of Homeland Security to establish standard procedures for addressing complaints made against CBP employees and to enhance training for CBP officers and agents.[15][16] Miller said that ""Today, the House passed legislation that provides the necessary statutory authorization that will protect the agency's mission by providing our officers and agents proper authorities to carry out their important work.""[16]
The bill Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress) passed in the House on March 4, 2014.[17] The bill delayed indefinitely some of the reforms to the deeply indebted National Flood Insurance Program.[17] The primary issue what the premiums should be on home and business owners located in flood zones. Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should.[18] Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that ""too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater.""[18]
Miller was elected Michigan Secretary of State, unseating 6-term incumbent Richard H. Austin. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since Owen Cleary left office in 1955.
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including Wayne County, home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and Reform Party's Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,[19] the largest margin of victory for a candidate running statewide in Michigan.
After the 2000 United States Census, the Michigan Legislature reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term Democrat David Bonior. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the Thumb. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in Mount Clemens to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the governor of Michigan rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a ""Hubert Humphrey Democrat"", and Miller called herself a ""George W. Bush Republican."" She outraised Marlinga, and secured the Teamsters Union (but not AFL-CIO) endorsement.[2]
Miller faced no opposition in the Republican primary, and was acclaimed as the Republican candidate on August 8, 2006. In the general election Miller was challenged by Democrat Robert Denison and three third-party candidates. Miller defeated Denison 178,843 to 84,574 votes.
Miller was reelected against Democratic candidate Robert Denison, Libertarian candidate Neil Kiernan Stephenson, and Green candidate Candace Caveny.[20]
During the 2008 Presidential election, Miller endorsed Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, ""When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation.""
Miller spoke on behalf of Senator John McCain and was a vocal supporter of Governor Sarah Palin. She was a member of Gov. Palin's ""truth squad"" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.
Miller was challenged by Democratic nominee Henry Yanez, a Sterling Heights firefighter and paramedic. He is currently the Chairman of the 10th District Democrats and was a delegate to the 2004 and 2008 Democratic National Conventions.[21] Miller won reelection November 3, 2010 with nearly 72% of the vote, beating Yanez, two minor party candidates, and a write-in.[2][22][23][24]
Mrs. Miller's choice for Chairman of Michigan's 10th congressional district Republican committee[citation needed] lost to her former assistant secretary of state, Stanley Grot, a local Tea Party activist. Grot is chairman of the district committee, clerk of Shelby Township, and formerly a constituent relations representative in the Michigan Attorney General's office. He has been president of the American Polish Cultural Center.[25][26][27][28] After Henry Yanez dropped out to run for a State Representative position, two candidates, Jerome Quinn and Chuck Stalder, have declared and will face each other in a primary set for August 7, 2012 to decide who will have the Democratic nomination, and be facing Mrs. Miller in the 2012 general election.
Miller's husband Donald Miller is a retired Circuit Court judge in the 16th Circuit Court for Macomb County. He was a fighter pilot, flew combat missions in Vietnam, commanded the Selfridge Air National Guard Base and retired from the Air National Guard as a Colonel. Their daughter is a member of the United Auto Workers Union.[2][29]"

Dingell and U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D - MI) were the proponents of moving up Michigan's Presidential Primary before February 5, to attempt to garner greater political influence for Michigan during the 2008 Democratic Primaries.[9] which resulted in Michigan almost losing half its delegates' votes in the Democratic Convention.[10]

"210","","1965","1929","Michigan 13","Wayne State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Conyers","John Conyers","Democratic","Congressional aide","Baptist - NBC","John James Conyers, Jr. (born May 16, 1929) is the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 13th congressional district,[1] serving in Congress since 1965 (the district was numbered as the 1st District until 1993, and as the 14th district from 1993 to 2013). The district includes the western half of Detroit, as well as Dearborn, Highland Park, and most of the downriver suburbs including Wyandotte and Romulus. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Conyers, as its longest-serving current member, is the Dean of the House of Representatives. He is also the oldest and the longest-serving current member of the United States Congress.


After graduating from Northwestern High School in Detroit, Conyers served in the Michigan National Guard 194850; U.S. Army 195054; and the U.S. Army Reserves 195457. Conyers served for a year in Korea as an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was awarded combat and merit citations.[2] Conyers grew up in Detroit, and received both his B.A. and his law degree from Wayne State University.
Conyers was present in Selma, Alabama, on October 7, 1963, for the civil rights movement voter registration drive known as Freedom Day.[3] He served as an assistant to U.S. Congressman John Dingell, Jr., prior to his election to Congress.
While serving in the U.S. House, Conyers made two unsuccessful runs for mayor of Detroit: one in 1989 against incumbent Coleman Young and again in 1993.[4]
Incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to run for a fifth term, despite growing unpopularity and the declining economy of Detroit. In the September primary, Young won with 51% of the vote. Accountant Tom Barrow qualified for the November run off by getting second place with 24% and Conyers got third place with 18% of the vote.[5] Young defeated Barrow in the run off with 56% of the vote.[6]
In June 1993, incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term, citing his age and health, although many believed he decided not to run because of his growing unpopularity. In a Detroit News poll in February, 81% said Young should retire.[7] Conyers was one of the 23 candidates who qualified for ballot access.[8] Dennis Archer was a clear front runner from the beginning. He was a 51-year-old former State Supreme Court Justice who raised over $1.6 million. He won the September primary with 54% of the vote. Conyers came in fourth place.[9] Archer won the November election.
In 1964, he ran for an open seat in what was then the 1st District, and defeated Republican Robert Blackwell with 84% of the vote. He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins. After the 1990 United States Census, Michigan lost a congressional district and Conyers's district was renumbered to the 14th district. In 1992, he won re-election to his 15th term in his new district with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon. He won re-election another nine times after that. His worst re-election performance was in 2010, when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee Don Ukrainec.
In total, he has won re-election twenty-five times and is serving in his twenty-sixth term. He is the longest-serving current member of the House, the longest-serving current member of the entire Congress, the fourth longest-serving member of the House in history, and the seventh longest-serving member of Congress in history. He is the second-longest serving member of either house of Congress in Michigan's history, trailing only his former boss, Dingell. He is also the last member of the large Democratic freshman class of 1964 who is still serving in the House.
In May 2014, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett determined that Conyers had not submitted enough valid nominating petition signatures to appear on the August 2014 Primary Election ballot.[10] Two of his petition circulators were found not to have been registered voters at the time they were collecting signatures, as required under Michigan law. However, on May 23, Federal District Judge Matthew Leitman issued an injunction placing Conyers back on the ballot, ruling that the requirement that circulators be registered voters was similar to an Ohio law previously found unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court in 2008.[11] The Michigan Secretary of State's office subsequently announced they would not appeal the ruling.[12]
Conyers is one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and is considered the Dean of that group. Formed in 1969, the CBC was founded to strengthen African-American lawmakers' ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. He has served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of Nixon's Enemies List.
In 1965, John Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential Judiciary Committee, which was then under the leadership of Democratic Congressman Emanuel Celler of New York. At the time, the assignment was an elite one, as Judiciary ranked behind only Ways and Means and Appropriations in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there.[13]
According to the National Journal, Conyers has been considered, with Pete Stark, John Lewis, Jim McDermott, and Barbara Lee, to be one of the most liberal members of Congress for many years. Civil rights icon Rosa Parks served on Conyers' staff between 1965 and 1988.
Conyers is known as one of the opponents of the drive to regulate online gambling. He has likened the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, hidden within the SAFE Port Act, to Prohibition.
After Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. It is now celebrated as Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
Conyers introduced the ""Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act"" (H.R. 40) in January 1989, and has re-introduced anew this bill each congressional term. This bill calls for the creation of a commission to research the history of slavery and its effects on current America, resulting in recommendations on how to remedy this injustice. Its current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3, 2013.[14]
Conyers first introduced the House of Resolution 40 in 1989, and have annual proposed this act until it is approved and passed. The House Resolution 40 expresses the impact of slavery's brutal institution on today's society, politics, and economy. ""My bill does four things: It acknowledges the fundamental injustice and inhumanity of slavery It establishes a commission to study slavery, its subsequent racial and economic discrimination against freed slaves; It studies the impact of those forces on today's living African Americans; and The commission would then make recommendations to Congress on appropriate remedies to redress the harm inflicted on living African Americans.""[15]
Conyers was critical of Richard Nixon during his tenure, and as a result was number 13 on President Richard Nixon's enemies list during Nixon's 196974 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as ""coming on fast,"" and that he was ""emerging"" as a ""black anti-Nixon spokesman.""[16][17]
Conyers voted on the Articles of Impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. He is the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so, although another fellow Committee member, Democratic Congressman Charles B. Rangel, of New York, is still in Congress.
The United States National Health Care Act (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676) is a bill submitted to the United States House of Representatives by Conyers which, as of September 29, 2008, has 93 cosponsors. It was first introduced, with 25 cosponsors, in 2003,[18] and reintroduced each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge. In order to eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would also prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act. The bill is currently in the House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health.
On May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the Downing Street memo, a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to attack Iraq in 2002. The Times reported that newly discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had ""discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so."" The documents go on to say that Tony Blair decided the United States would need to ""create"" conditions to justify the war.[citation needed]
The memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States, prompting Conyers to lament: ""This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the Michael Jackson trial and a runaway bride.""[19] Conyers and others reportedly considered sending a congressional investigation delegation to London.[20]
In May, 2005, Conyers released What Went Wrong In Ohio: The Conyers Report On The 2004 Presidential Election, which discusses the voting irregularities in the state of Ohio during the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election. The evidence offered consists of statistical abnormalities in the differences between exit poll results and actual votes registered at those locations. The book also discusses reports of faulty electronic voting machines and the lack of credibility of those machines used to tally votes.
He was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[21]
On August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War, an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the Bush Administration altered intelligence to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The Constitution in Crisis examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush Administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates the conditions that led to the torture scandal at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, as well as further evidence of torture having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of ""smear tactics"" purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries.
The document calls for the censure of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Notably, however, Conyers refused to back impeachment proceedings.
Conyers has proposed House Resolution 288, which condemns religious intolerance but emphasizes Islam as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that it should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the Quran, Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form, and calls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent bias-motivated crimes and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith. The bill was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution in June 2005.

In April 2006 Conyers, together with ten other senior congressmen, filed an action in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, challenging the constitutionality of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The complaint alleged the bill was not afforded due consideration by the United States Congress before being signed by the President.[22] The action was subsequently dismissed on grounds of lack of standing.[23]
In letters sent separately to the House Ethics Committee, the FBI, and the US Attorney's office, two former aides of Conyers alleged that Conyers used his staff to work on several local and state campaigns, and forced them to baby-sit and chauffeur his children.[24] In late December 2006, Conyers ""accepted responsibility"" for possibly violating House rules. A statement issued December 29, 2006, by the House Ethics Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-WA) and Ranking Minority Member Howard Berman (D-CA), said that Conyers acknowledged what he characterized as a ""lack of clarity"" in his communications with staff members regarding their official duties and responsibilities, and accepted responsibility for his actions. In deciding to drop the matter, Hastings and Berman stated:
After reviewing the information gathered during the inquiry, and in light of Representative Conyers cooperation with the inquiry, we have concluded that this matter should be resolved through the issuance of this public statement and the agreement by Representative Conyers to take a number of additional, significant steps to ensure that his office complies with all rules and standards regarding campaign and personal work by congressional staff.[25]
Also, in 1992, he was implicated in the House banking scandal.
Conyers has come under fire from scientific and taxpayers' advocacy groups[26] for repeatedly introducing a bill that would overturn NIH Public Access Policy, and forbid the government from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.[27] Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed significant money to Conyers.[28]
On January 13, 2009, the House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Conyers, released ""Reining in the Imperial Presidency: Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush,"" a 486-page report detailing alleged abuses of power that occurred during the Bush administration, and a comprehensive set of recommendations to prevent recurrence. Conyers has introduced a bill to set up a ""truth commission"" panel to investigate alleged policy abuses of the Bush administration.[29][30]
In late July 2009, Conyers, commenting on the healthcare debate in the House, stated: I love these members, they get up and say, Read the bill'... What good is reading the bill if its a thousand pages and you dont have two days and two lawyers to find out what it means after you read the bill? His remark brought criticism from government transparency advocates such as the Sunlight Foundation, which referred to readthebill.org in response.[31] In the House, 93 representatives signed a pledge, started by Mike Pence of Indiana, to read a health care bill before voting on it.[32]
On June 16, 2009, the United States Attorney's Office said that two Synagro Technologies representatives had named Monica Conyers as the recipient of bribes from the company totaling more than $60,000, paid to influence passage of a contract with the City of Detroit.[33][34] The information was gathered during an FBI investigation into political corruption in the city.[35] She was given a pre-indictment letter, and offered a plea bargain deal in the case.[33] On June 26, 2009, she was charged with conspiring to commit bribery. She pleaded guilty.[36] On March 10, 2010, she was sentenced to 37 months in prison, and also received two years of supervised probation.[37] She ended up serving just over 27 months at the Alderson Federal Prison Camp[38] and was released from federal custody officially on May 16, 2013.[39]
In October, Conyers responded to allegations from four Republican Congress Members, in the wake of the launch of the book Muslim Mafia, that the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sought to plant Muslim ""spies"" in Capitol Hill. He strongly opposed the accusations, saying:
Conyers was one of the first three U.S. Congress members to condemn the allegations, joining Andr Carson (D-IN) and Loretta Sanchez (D-CA).
At a December 16, 2010 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on the subject of ""the Espionage Act and the Legal and Constitutional Issues Raised by WikiLeaks,""[41] Conyers ""argue[d] strongly against prosecuting WikiLeaks in hasteor at all.""[42] He strongly defended the whistleblowing organization, saying:
""As an initial matter, there is no doubt that WikiLeaks is very unpopular right now. Many feel that the WikiLeaks publication was offensive. But being unpopular is not a crime, and publishing offensive information is not either. And the repeated calls from politicians, journalists, and other so-called experts crying out for criminal prosecutions or other extreme measures make me very uncomfortable. Indeed, when everyone in this town is joined together calling for someones head, that is it a pretty strong sign we need to slow down and take a closer look.... [L]et us not be hasty, and let us not legislate in a climate of fear or prejudice. For, in such an atmosphere, it is our constitutional freedoms and our cherished civil rights that are the first to be sacrificed in the false service of our national security.""[42]
Conyers's statement was ""in marked contrast to the repeated calls from other members of Congress and Obama administration officials to prosecute (or kill) WikiLeaks head Julian Assange immediately.""[42]
Conyers is married to Monica Conyers.
He appeared in Michael Moore's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 discussing the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, stating that members of Congress ""don't read most of the bills."" Conyers frequently posts at Daily Kos and Democratic Underground. Since May 2005, he has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post and his own blog.
In 2007 he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[43]"

Lawrence (born October 18, 1954) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the Mayor of Southfield, Michigan from 2001 to 2015. The Democratic nominee for Oakland County Executive in 2008 and for Lieutenant Governor in 2010 She was elected US Representative for Michigan's 14th congressional district after winning the seat in the 2014 elections.


Lawrence grew up in Detroit's northeast side, on Lumpkin Street. She was raised by her grandparents after her mother died when she was three years old.[1] She graduated from Detroit's Pershing High School, and earned her bachelor's degree in Public Administration from Central Michigan University.
In the early 1990s, as an active member of the Parent Teacher's Association at her children's school, she sought and earned a seat on the Southfield Public Schools Board of Education, serving as president, vice president, and secretary.
In 1997, she was elected to serve on Southfield's City Council and in 1999 she was elected council president.
In 2001, she defeated longtime Southfield Mayor Donald Fracassi, becoming the city's first African-American and first female Mayor. She was re-elected in 2005 without opposition.[2] As Mayor, she was invited by the U.S. House Oversight Committee in 2008 to represent United States mayors in testimony about the mortgage crisis and its effect on American communities.[3] She returned to Washington later that year to lobby Congress for a bridge loan for the American auto industry.[4]
Lawrence was a Michigan delegate to the 2004 Democratic National Convention. As a superdelegate at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, she endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama for president in June 2008.[5]
She successfully sought a third term as mayor in 2009, defeating former Councilwoman Sylvia Jordan with nearly 80 percent of the vote.[6] She was re-elected to a fourth term unopposed in 2013.[7]
In May 2008, Lawrence announced her candidacy for Oakland County Executive. She was unopposed for the Democratic nomination to unseat the long-timeRepublican incumbent, L. Brooks Patterson. Patterson won re-election 58%-42%. Lawrence's challenge to the polarizing Patterson was identified as the strongest challenge he faced in his six elections for County Executive.[8][9]
Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero named Lawrence as his running mate in his bid for Michigan governor. She was formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor at the Michigan Democratic Party convention in August 2010. They campaigned around the state promoting a 'Main Street Agenda' with emphasis on their shared backgrounds as mayors.[10]
As with the national election results, the 2010 general election in Michigan saw strong turnout and enthusiasm by Republican voters. Political pundits attributed the losses by Democrats, in part, to voter reaction to Democratic President Barack Obama and term-limited Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm. The Democratic gubernatorial ticket lost to Republican nominees Rick Snyder, a businessman, and Brian Calley, a State Representative, 58%-40%. No Democrats were elected statewide in 2010.[11]
In late 2011, she announced she would be running in the newly redrawn 14th congressional district. She faced U.S. Representatives Hansen Clarke and Gary Peters, both of whom lived outside the district,[12] and former State Representative Mary D. Waters. Peters won with 47%, Clarke took 35%, Lawrence 13% and Waters 3%. Peters went on to win the general election.
In May 2013, Peters announced that he would not be running for re-election in 2014. He is instead running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democrat Carl Levin. On January 23, 2014, Lawrence announced that she would be running for the 14th district for the second time.[13]
Lawrence was the first candidate to submit signatures to the state in order to be on the August primary ballot, doing so in March. Other candidates that filed for the Democratic nomination were former Congressman Hansen Clarke of Detroit, State Representative Rudy Hobbs of Southfield and teacher Burgess D. Foster of Detroit.
During the course of the campaign's contribution reporting, Hobbs raised a total of $607,806, Lawrence raised a total of $383,649 and Clarke raised a total of $173,124; Burgess reported no contributions to the Federal Election Commission, indicating that he raised or spent less than $5,000. Michigan Congressman Sander Levin's Political Action Committee, GOALPAC, also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to help elect Hobbs, who was previously employed on Levin's congressional staff.[14]
Lawrence won the Democratic Party nomination on August 5, 2014, despite being outspent. Lawrence won with 36% of the vote, Hobbs took 32%, Clarke 31% and Foster 1%. She took the most votes in Oakland County, carrying the cities of Southfield, Pontiac and Oak Park, as well as Royal Oak Township. Although it was expected that Clarke would convincingly win the portion of Detroit within the district, where he lives and had previously held public office, Lawrence was competitive in the city and won more votes than all other candidates from voters who cast their ballot on Election Day in Detroit.[15]
As the Democratic nominee for Congress, she faced Republican nominee Christina Conyers of Detroit in the November general election. But Conyers withdrew from the race and Christina Barr of Pontiac was chosen as the Republican nominee.[16] The district has a history of voting heavily for Democratic candidates. Also facing off against Lawrence in the November election was Libertarian Party nominee Leonard Schwartz of Oak Park and Green Party nominee Stephen Boyle of Detroit.[17] Lawrence won with 78% of the vote, Barr took 20%, Schwartz 1% and Boyle 1%

Her husband is a United Auto Workers retiree from Ford Motor Company.[18]"
"212","","2007","1964","Minnesota 1","Chadron State College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz","Tim Walz","DFL","Army National Guard Command Sergeant Major, teacher","Lutheran - ELCA","Timothy James ""Tim"" Walz (born April 6, 1964)[5] is an American politician and member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party who has served as the U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 1st congressional district since 2007.
The district comprises the state's southern end, running along the entire border with Iowa. It includes Rochester, Austin, Winona and Mankato.
A retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard, Walz is the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress. A moderate Democrat, Walz was first elected in 2006, defeating six-term Republican incumbent Gil Gutknecht. He has since been re-elected four times and serves on the Agriculture, Transportation and Infrastructure and Veterans' Affairs committees.


Walz was born in West Point, Nebraska, the son of Darlene R. and James F. ""Jim"" Walz. His ancestry includes German, Irish, and Swedish.[6] Walz, the son of a public school administrator and community activist, was raised in Chadron, Nebraska, a rural community in the northwestern portion of the state.
Walz graduated from Butte High School in a class of 25 students, and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in social science education from Chadron State College. Walz's first teaching experience was at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Walz then accepted a teaching position with WorldTeach, teaching in the People's Republic of China.[7]
Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, and over the course of his 24-year career rose to the rank of command sergeant major. In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen-Soldier of the Year. After a deployment to Italy with his Guard unit as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Walz retired from the Army National Guard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and football coach at Mankato West Senior High School.[7]
He and his wife Gwen ran Educational Travel Adventures, accompanying high school juniors and seniors on summer educational trips to China. Walz has two children one daughter and one son.[8]
He currently resides in Mankato, Minnesota.[9]
Walz decide to run for Congress in 2006.[10] Walz had no opponent in the race for the DFL nomination for the seat in the September 12, 2006 primary election. He beat incumbent Republican Gil Gutknecht in the general election on November 7, and took office on January 3, 2007. After the election, a Walz profile described him as having caught Gutknecht off guard and as having resolved never to get caught like that himself....He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.[11]
He was reelected in 2008 with 62 percent of the vote, becoming only the second non-Republican to win a second full term in the district. He won a third term in 2010, defeating State Representative Randy Demmer with 50 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014.[12]
Upon his swearing in, Walz became the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress,[13] as well as only the fourth Democrat/DFLer to represent the 1st District. The others were Thomas Wilson (188789), William Harries (189193), and Tim Penny 1983-1995 (DFL).
Walz serves on the House Agriculture Committee,[14] Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Along with fellow Minnesota freshman Democrat, Keith Ellison, Walz opposed President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq.[15] In his first week as a legislator, Walz cosponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage, voted for stem cell research, voted to allow Medicare to negotiate pharmaceutical prices, and voiced support for pay-as-you-go budget rules, requiring that new spending or tax changes not add to the federal deficit.[16]
Representing a district that has traditionally voted Republican, but has recently become a swing district due to changing demographics, Walz has cast votes ranging from moderate to liberal.[17] He voted no on the act to Prohibit Federally Funded Abortion Services,[18] and voted yes to advance the current Health Care bill out of the house.[19] He has also voted to continue troop funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan[20] and he voted against the 2008 TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from financial institutions.[21]
Walz received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood in 2012, from the ACLU in 2011, from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in 2009-10, from the AFL-CIO in 2010, from the Teamsters in 2009-10, and from NOW in 2007. In recent years he has received one-digit ratings from the National Taxpayers' Union, Citizens against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform, and Freedom Works. The US Chamber of Commerce gave him a 25% rating in 2010.[22]
Having served 24 years in the Army National Guard, Walz is the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress. As a freshman in Congress he was given a rare third committee membership when he was assigned to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.[23] Walz has championed enhanced veterans benefits since taking office in 2007. In May of that year the House unanimously passed his Traumatic Brain Injuries Center Act to set up 5 centers around the nation to study traumatic brain injuries and develop improved models for caring for veterans suffering from such injuries.[24]
Walz also supported the new GI Bill of 2008 which expanded education benefits for veterans and in some cases allowed them to transfer education benefits to family members.[25] In 2009, Walz gave the keynote address at the American Legion National Convention in Louisville, KY. In his speech he spoke about the need for the VA and Department of Defense to work together to make sure that returning service men and women do not fall through the cracks when they transition to civilian life. [26]
Following his re-election in 2014, Walz announced that he intended to seek the position of ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The position will be open as ranking member Mike Michaud did not run for re-election. Although Walz is the third longest-serving member, he is technically the most junior as he gets a waiver from the leadership to sit at the bottom of the committee and remain on two others. His announcement will likely set up a battle with Corrine Brown, who is officially next in line.[27]
During 2008, Walz repeatedly spoke out against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions.[28] Walz released a statement after passage of the bill saying, ""The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes to recouping the losses taxpayers might suffer. I also regret that this bill does not do enough to help average homeowners, or provide sufficient oversight of Wall Street.[29] In December 2008 he used the same reasoning when he voted against the bill that offered $14 billion in government loans to bail out the countrys large automobile manufacturers.[30] In June 2009 Walz introduced a bi-partisan resolution calling on the federal government to ""relinquish its temporary ownership interests in the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Group, LLC, as soon as possible and stated that the government must not be involved in the management decisions of those companies.[31]
Despite his No votes on bailout bills which loaned taxpayer money to the large banks and auto manufacturers, Walz did vote with his Democratic colleagues to support the 2009 American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (aka Stimulus bill). As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Walz saw the stimulus bill as an opportunity to work with his congressional colleagues to make job creation through investment in public infrastructure like roads, bridges and clean energy the cornerstone of the economic recovery plan.[32] Walz has focused heavily on job and economic issues that are important to his southern Minnesota district, which has a mix of larger employers like the Mayo Clinic along with small businesses and agricultural interests. In July 2009 he voted for the Small Business Research and Innovation Act which he described as ""part of our long-term economic blueprint to spur job creation by encouraging America's entrepreneurs to innovate toward breakthrough technological advancements.""[33][34] Walz has also put emphasis on the farm economy by urging assistance for hog and dairy farmers who struggled with lower prices for their commodities in 2008 and 2009.[35]
Walz was a public school teacher for 20 years. He is a strong supporter of Public Schools and opposes using merit pay for teachers in low-income schools as punishment.[36] Voting in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Walz pointed to its strong provisions in support of public school buildings.[37][38] Walz is on record supporting legislation to lower tuition costs.[39] He said in a February 12, 2009 speech, that the most important thing to do to ensure a solid base for [Americas] economic future...is to provide the best education possible for [American] children.[40] He has received strong backing for these policies by many interest groups such as the National Education Association, the American Association of University Women and the National Association of Elementary School Principals.[41]
When asked in 2006 Walz responded that he supported all kinds of legal abortions, including cases of incest or rape.[36] Planned Parenthood, a national organization supporting the reproductive rights of women and women's health initiatives, gave Walz a 100% rating on their issues, including contraceptive, women's health education and family planning.[41] Walz voted against House Amendments 509 & 510.[clarification needed][18][42] The National Right to Life Committee gave Walz a rating of zero.[41] In early 2009, Walz voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work.[43]
Walz is a strong supporter of equal rights for all, including women and the LGBT community. In early 2009, Walz voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work.[43] When asked, Walz confirmed his support for federal anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation.[36] In a 2009 speech in Washington DC, Walz called for an end to the Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy, saying that sexual discrimination has no place in the military and that sexual orientation of individuals does not affect the professionalism of units.[44] Walz voted in favor of the Matthew Shephard Hate Crimes Act, making sure federal law mirrored Minnesota law when it comes to hate crimes against the LGBT community. He also voted in favor of the Sexual Orientation Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which would prohibit LGBT people from being fired because of their sexual orientation.[45] In 2007, Walz received a 90% grade from the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT organization.[41] In 2011, Walz announced his support for the Respect for Marriage Act.[46]

The district includes most of the southern suburbs of the Twin Cities, including Apple Valley, Inver Grove Heights, Burnsville, Eagan, Lakeville, Northfield, and Shakopee. A member of the Republican Party, Kline serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.


Kline was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania,[1] the son of Litta Belle (ne Rodman) and John Paul Kline, Sr. He is a 1965 graduate of W. B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. He earned a B.A. in biology at Rice University (1969), and a Master of Public Administration from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania (1988).
Before his election to Congress, Kline was a 25-year veteran of the United States Marine Corps, where he was a senior military aide to Presidents Carter and Reagan and was responsible for carrying the President's ""football"".[citation needed] During his military career, Kline served as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, commanded all Marine aviation forces in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, flew ""Marine One,"" the Presidential helicopter, and served as Program Development Officer at Headquarters Marine Corps. He received numerous medals and commendations, including Four Legions of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal (awarded 3 times), the Vietnam Campaign Medal, a Presidential Service Badge, and the Navy Commendation Medal.[2] Kline retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel.
Kline and his second wife, Vicky, live in Burnsville, Minnesota.[3] Kline has two children and four grandchildren. Kline was previously married to Christine Lewis.[4]
Kline supported President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq in January, 2007.[5]
During Kline's 2008 bid for reelection he discussed his opposition to earmarks and his refusal to request them for his district.[6]
In 2006, Kline voted to maintain the legal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman.[7] He voted for the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.[8]
Kline has opposed restrictions on gun ownership.[9][10] He voted to repeal parts of the firearms ban for Washington, D.C.[11] He has described himself as ""a collector of antique guns and a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment"".[12]
Kline has stated, ""Job creation is our nation's no. 1 challenge and Congress must make it our no. 1 priority.""[13] Kline has spoken in support of education reform designed to encourage parent involvement and teacher accountability.[14] He is opposed to any tax increases and has stated that such strategies must be taken ""off the table.""[15] In remarks made to fellow representatives, Kline said, ""we are watching a massive growth of government power, size, and spending, and I deem that unacceptable.""[16]
In 2013 Kline proposed a bill that, among other adjustments, changed the rate on subsidized Stafford loans from 3.4% to 5.9%. The bill linked the rate of interest to the rate of US borrowing.[17]
Kline has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[18] His campaign site states that ""he opposed Obamacare because it is a seriously flawed law that was too big, was passed too fast, and does too much harm."" [19]
On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend and reauthorize both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization.[20][21] This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million.[22] The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.[21]
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District Democratic incumbent Bill Luther and lost, taking 46% of the vote. He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while George W. Bush narrowly carried the district.
After the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged. The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs. At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor. The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican Mark Kennedy, just inside the reconfigured 6th District. Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district. After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.
During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the ""No New Taxes Party."" This was done in retaliation for an ad the National Republican Congressional Committee ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. [23] Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.
Kline then defeated Democratic Burnsville City Councilwoman Teresa Daly to win a second term in 2004 and former FBI Special agent and whistleblower Coleen Rowley, one of Time magazine's ""Persons of the Year"", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former Watertown mayor Steve Sarvi and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.
Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham's PAC. After Cunninghams indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.[24]
Kline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.[25]
So far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the Apollo Group, an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the University of Phoenix. The corporation has given $33,100 toward Kline's campaign committee and leadership PAC.[26]
In 2014, he was the winner of comedian Bill Maher's ""Flip a District"" contest for the most useless congressman from a group of 16 semi-finalists nominated by viewers nationwide.[27][28]
Local paper the Star Tribune reported Kline is attempting to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher's campaign. Kline's spokesman said ""Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics, but Kline's opponent, certainly isnt. Kline's opponent Mike Obermueller reported a 700 percent increase in fundraising.[29]
In the 2012 US House elections, Kline defeated Democrat Mike Obermueller by 8%.[30]"

Paulsen won the election with 48.48% of the vote, to Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nominee Ashwin Madia's 40.85% and Independence Party of Minnesota candidate David Dillon's 10.56%. While not achieving a majority, Paulsen defeated Madia by about 30,000 votes.[9]
Paulson won reelection with 59% of the vote against Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party challenger Jim Meffert.[10]

Paulsen strongly supported the Money Remittances Improvement Act of 2014 (H.R. 4386; 113th Congress), a bill that would make it easier for nonbank financial institutions such as money service businesses to provide remittance payments internationally.[36] Paulsen argued that the bill would make it easier for American immigrants ""supporting their extended families overseas"" to help their relatives, while still ""providing the necessary safeguards to ensure their money reaches its intended destination.""[37] The bill would help these people by ""streamlining the remittance process and eliminating regulatory barriers to sending money home.""[37]
On November 21, 2013, Paulsen introduced the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3610; 113th Congress), a bill that would require each state, within three years, to have in effect legislation that: (1) treats a minor who has engaged or attempted to engage in a commercial sex act as a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, (2) discourages the charging or prosecution of such an individual for a prostitution or sex trafficking offense, and (3) encourages the diversion of such individual to child protection services.[38] The bill was scheduled to be voted on in the House on May 20, 2014 under a suspension of the rules.[39]

She is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL).
McCollum's district centers on St. Paul, Minnesota's capital city. She is the second woman elected to Congress from Minnesota.


McCollum was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She has two younger siblings, Anthony and Monica. McCollum is divorced and has two children. She graduated from the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1976. McCollum has worked as a high school social sciences teacher and as a sales manager. She first got involved in politics in 1986, when her daughter got hurt on a slide in a North St. Paul city park. When the city council wouldn't do anything to fix the slide, McCollum's neighbors encouraged her to run for a spot on the council herself. She won that November and served three terms.[2] She then challenged longtime state representative Rich O'Conner in the DFL primary and won an upset victory. She went on to serve four terms in the state house.
McCollum currently serves on the United States House Appropriations Committee and the following subcommittees:


McCollum has also previously served on:
McCollum is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, where she is the only Minnesotan. At the start of the 111th Congress, McCollum was also appointed to the United States House Budget Committee. Under normal circumstances, House Democrats aren't allowed to serve on another committee when they also serve on one of the chamber's four exclusive ""A"" committeesAppropriations, Energy and Commerce, Rules, and Ways and Means. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and committee chairman Henry Waxman granted McCollum a waiver allowing her to take a second committee slot. McCollum served on the Government Reform Committee during her first term in Congress.[6]
She is the first Minnesota woman elected to Congress since Coya Knutson in the 1950s. In January, 2007 she was joined by the first Republican woman elected from Minnesota  Michele Bachmann of the 6th district.
McCollum received a 91% progressive rating from a self-described non-partisan group that provides a ""searchable database of Congressional voting records from a Progressive perspective""[7] and scored a 13% conservative rating by the conservative group, SBE Council.[8]
Representative McCollum has supported the interests of Pro-Choice interest groups such as Planned Parenthood, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, and NARAL Pro-Choice America.[9] Most of these groups have the same main goals. One example would be the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association which aims to provide access to family planning and reproductive health care services and to support reproductive freedom for all.[10] She indicated on the 2002 National Political Awareness Test that she believed abortions should always be legally available, but only within the first trimester of pregnancy.[11]
The entire time Representative McCollum has been in office, she has supported gay civil rights.[12] The Human Rights Campaign is Americas largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality.[13] They have continually approved of her voting record.[12] In one speech opposing the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, she stated, ""Gay and lesbian Americans are citizens who must never be treated as second class citizens"".[14]
She has supported the interests of the elderly with regard to preserving social security. She has supported organizations such as the Alliance for Retired Americans and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, who share the mission to ensure social and economic justice and full civil rights for all citizens so that they may enjoy lives of dignity, personal and family fulfillment and security.[15] In a position paper, Representative McCollum defended her position on Social Security. She stated, ""We can secure the future of Social Security with common sense and a shared, bipartisan commitment to economic security and fiscal responsibility for all Americans. This is my commitment, and you can count on me to work to protect Social Security and to find a solution that truly protects the retirement security of every American."" [16]
McCollum advocates shifting America's energy consumption to cleaner, non carbon based sources. McCollum, along with Al Franken, and Kit Bond presented Congress with the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act. The plan would utilize thermal energy sources and create renewable energy production tax credits.[17] She also voted in favor of American Recovery and Reinvestment in 2009.[18]
In 2004, McCollum gained national visibility when she and fellow Democrat, Jim McDermott of Washington called for Secretary of Education Rod Paige to resign for claiming the National Education Association was ""a terrorist organization.""
McCollum made headlines in February 2011 when she voted to end military sponsorship of NASCAR teams. The amendment failed 148-241. She also introduced an amendments in June, 2011 and 2012 to cut funding for military bands by $125 million, a proposal opposed by the Fleet Reserve Association and described by the National Association for Music Education as ""potentially devastating.""[19]
McCollum opposes Conceal-and-Carry legislation, and in November 2011 she voted against Right-to-Carry reciprocity.[11]
On October 5, she omitted the phrase ""Under God"" from the pledge during a House session. The video of the session quickly became viral and her omission was interpreted as being intentional.[20] However, her website maintained that she respects the phrase ""Under God"" in the United State Pledge.[21]
After 4th District Representative Bruce Vento decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her Republican opponent, State Senator Linda Runbeck, but Independence Party candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for Ramsey County (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.
In 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president."

University of Minnesota Law School","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Ellison","Keith Ellison","DFL","Minnesota House of Representatives","Muslim","Keith Maurice Ellison (born August 4, 1963) is the U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, the Minnesota state Democratic Party affiliate. The district centers on Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs. Ellison is a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Chief Deputy Whip for the 113th Congress, also notably serving in the House Committee on Financial Services.
Ellison is the first Muslim[1][2] to be elected to Congress. He is also the first African American elected to the House from Minnesota.[3]


Keith Ellison, the third of five sons, was born and raised Roman Catholic[4] in Detroit, Michigan, by his parents Leonard Ellison, a social worker and a psychiatrist, and Clida (Martinez) Ellison.[2][5][6] Ellison and three of his brothers became lawyers; his other brother became a doctor. One of Ellison's brothers is also the pastor of the Baptist ""Church of the New Covenant"" in Detroit.[5] Ellison's youth was influenced by the involvement of his family in the civil rights movement, including his grandfather's work as a member of the NAACP in Louisiana.[2]
Ellison graduated in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, where he was active in sports and a senator in the student government.[5][8] At age 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: ""I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [of my conversion]. I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam.""[9][10][11]
After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1987, Ellison married his high-school sweetheart[4] and moved to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota Law School. While there, he wrote several articles in support of Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Ellison graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1990.[12][13]
Ellison and his former wife Kim, a high-school mathematics teacher,[14] had four children between 1989 and 1997:[15] a daughter, Amirah, and three sons, Jeremiah, Elijah, and Isaiah.[14] Kim Ellison is not Muslim, but their four children have been raised in that faith.[16] During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Kim Ellison revealed that she had been living with moderate multiple sclerosis for several years.[17] Ellison filed for a legal separation from Kim in 2010,[18] and their divorce was finalized on May 2, 2012.[19]
After law school, Ellison worked for three years at the firm of Lindquist & Vennum, where he was a litigator specializing in civil rights, employment, and criminal defense law.[12][15] Ellison then became executive director of the nonprofit Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis, which specializes in the defense of indigent clients.[15] Upon leaving the Legal Rights Center, Ellison entered private practice with the law firm Hassan & Reed Ltd, specializing in trial practice.[20] Ellison has also been regularly involved in community service. He served as the unpaid host of a public affairs talk program at KMOJ radio,[15] and has also often volunteered as a track coach for several organizations, working with youth between the ages of 5 and 18. He said, ""Its a great community-building device because its for all ages and all genders. Everyone can find a way to fit in.""[15]
In November 2002, Ellison was elected to his first public office, as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives serving House District 58B. At the time he took his seat, his party was the smallest House minority in Minnesota history.[21] During this session, Ellison was appointed to the Governmental Operations & Veterans Affairs Policy Committee, the Judiciary Policy & Finance Committee and the Local Government & Metropolitan Affairs Committee. In this session he spearheaded an ethics complaint against Rep. Arlon Lindner concerning remarks about homosexuals in the Holocaust.[citation needed]
Ellison was reelected to his seat in 2004 with 84% of the vote. During the 84th session, he served on the Civil Law & Elections Committee and the Public Safety Policy & Finance Committee. Upon his election to Congress, Ellison's seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives was filled by Augustine Dominguez, a Latino community activist and fellow member of the DFL.[22]
Ellison's House seat was previously held by Martin Olav Sabo, whose announcement of his intention to retire precipitated Ellison's candidacy. At the DFL Convention on May 6, 2006, Ellison won the party endorsement over 9 other candidates, leading 2-to-1 on the first ballot, and winning endorsement on the 4th ballot. In the primary, Ellison faced former state senator Ember Reichgott Junge, Minneapolis city council member Paul Ostrow, and Sabo's chief of staff Mike Erlandson, whom Sabo had endorsed. Ellison won the primary on September 12, 2006, with 41% of the vote.[23] One issue Ellison's campaign opponents raised was the repeated suspensions of his driver's license for failure to pay tickets and fines.[24] Ellison had also failed to pay all or part of his income taxes in five separate years between 1992 and 2000, forcing the state and Internal Revenue Service to put liens on his home. He later paid in excess of $18,000.[2][25]
In the November 2006 election, Ellison faced Republican Alan Fine, the Green Party's Jay Pond, and Tammy Lee of the Independence Party. Ellison won the seat with 56% of the vote.[26][27]
Ellison was elected to the House of Representatives on November 7, 2006, and sworn in on January 4, 2007. He garnered national attention with his decision to use an English translation of the Qur'an that once belonged to President Thomas Jefferson for his reenacted swearing-in ceremony, which generated both praise and criticisms from political pundits.
At the time of his swearing in, Ellison said he intended to focus on wages, housing, ""relief and justice for the middle class"", and ending the U.S. involvement in the Iraq War.[28] Ellison was also a vocal critic of President George W. Bush's administration, and sought a position on the House Judiciary Committee for oversight.[29]
In his first week as a member of Congress, Ellison voted with the new Democratic majority as part of the 100-Hour Plan to raise the minimum wage, for federal funding of stem cell research, and to allow Medicare to negotiate pharmaceutical prices.[30]
On April 3, 2014, Ellison introduced the Money Remittances Improvement Act of 2014 (H.R. 4386; 113th Congress) into the United States House.[31] The bill would make it easier for nonbank financial institutions such as money service businesses to provide remittance payments internationally.[32] Ellison said that ""passage of the Money Remittances Improvement Act is cause for celebration for all diaspora communities, including the Somali and Hmong communities I am proud to represent in Minnesota.""[33]
On May 3, 2007, Ellison introduced a bill to outlaw universal default, the practice whereby credit card companies raise interest rates on customers who are behind on payments to other creditors. The bill was supported by House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank. Ellison, who described the bill as ""the beginning of a whole credit reform effort we're going to be pursuing,"" also announced his interest in limiting high interest rates on credit cards and easing the process for those who have a legitimate need to file bankruptcy.[34] This provision ultimately became law in 2009 as part of the ""Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights"" portion of the Credit CARD Act of 2009.

See Note Below.[35]
In 2009 and 2011, Ellison had a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America indicating a pro-choice voting record.[40][41] In 2009, Ellison condemned the assassination of Dr. George Tiller by an anti-abortion activist, saying ""There is no room in America to justify murder in the name of ideological differences. I condemn the act committed against Dr. Tiller as well as those who take comfort from his death.""[42]
In an interview with the BBC's Program Outlook, on November 12, 2010, Ellison was asked to describe his constituents. He answered: ""The district I represent is the kind of district where you can have a Member of Congress stand up for religious tolerance and against religious bigotry, against anyone, but also stand up for the rights of gays too.""[43]
After President Bush vetoed HR 1591 that provided military funding for the Iraq War because it contained timetables for withdrawal, Ellison and fellow Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats in voting ""no"" to HR 2206 that provided the funding without any timetables. The bill passed the House on a 280 to 142 margin.[44]
Ellison joined fellow Minnesota freshman Democrat Tim Walz in opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq.[45] On January 10, 2007, Bush announced his plans for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was ""way too late, way too little ...So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're going to have to do eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?""[46] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: ""We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq.""[46] When asked if he would support Bushs call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, ""I want to see [the request] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis.""[46] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: ""Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?""[46]
On July 25, 2007, Ellison voted in the House Judiciary Committee to issue citations of Contempt of Congress to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers for ""failure to comply with subpoenas on the firings of several federal prosecutors"".[47]
On June 28, 2007, Ellison became a cosponsor of Rep. Dennis Kucinich bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Ellison's spokesperson, Rick Jauert, said the effort was ""largely to send a message"" and that Ellison ""has no illusions that this is going anywhere and that's fine. We've got more important things to do that affect people's daily lives. He basically signed on out of principle, as an expression of the importance of the rule of law  that nobody is above the law, not even the vice president.""[48]
On July 8, 2007, Ellison gave a speech in Edina, Minnesota, where he denounced Bush's commutation of Lewis Libby's sentence: ""If Libby gets pardoned, then he should not have the cover of the Fifth Amendment. He's going to have to come clean and tell the truth. Now, he could get Gonzales-itis [referring to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales], you know, with 71 lapses of memory within a two-hour period.""[49] He also criticized Bush's White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives saying, ""This is basically the Department of Religious Outreach ... . It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration to reach out to the far right of the evangelical Christian movement. That's really all it is.""[49]
Ellison issued a statement Friday March 21, 2008 that criticized the Chinese government for its Tibet policy and for its relationship with Sudan's leaders 'as they commit genocide on the citizens of Darfur.'""[50]
Ellison was arrested along with seven other people including U.S. Representatives James McGovern, John Lewis, Donna Edwards, Lynn Woolsey for civil disobedience in April 2009 when they spoke at the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. to protest that the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, had asked international aid groups bringing food, health care and water, to leave Darfur.[51] While in Khartoum in August 2009, Ellison wrote a message on Twitter saying he ""ran straight into Pres. Omar Bashir. He has been indicted by the Inter'l Crim. Ct. (ICC) for war crimes.""[52]
In late March and early April 2007, Ellison was a member of a congressional delegation on a ""fact-finding trip to the Middle East.""[53] The group included Representatives Henry Waxman, Tom Lantos, Louise Slaughter, Nick Rahall, Dave Hobson, who were led by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The delegation visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall. Ellison called his visit to Islam's third-holiest site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as ""personally moving"".[54][55] The group met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and discussed the peace plan devised by the Saudis in 2002.[54] The delegation also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
The group's visit to Syria was criticized by the Bush administration, which restated its view that the United States should not have diplomatic relations with state sponsors of terrorism.[53] While there the delegation conveyed a message from Olmert to Syrian President Bashar Assad that ""Israel is interested in peace if Damascus stops supporting terrorism"".[54] In Lebanon the group met with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and Speaker Nabih Berri. They also visited the grave of Rafik Hariri and met with his son Saad Hariri.[56] In Saudi Arabia the group spoke to King Abdullah and his Shura Council of advisors.[57] They praised his peace plan and advocated a greater role for women in his nation's political process. Ellison's inclusion in the delegation was praised by council member Abdul-Rahman al-Zamel.[56][57] Ellison called the king a ""visionary leader"" and that ""Even being in the same country where Mecca and Medina are located was personally uplifting for me.""[55] Ellison also said he hoped his presence as a Muslim among the delegation conveyed a message to the Israelis and Palestinians that ""people can come together. Reconciliation is possible.""[53]
On July 28 and 29, 2007, Ellison was among an ""all-freshman bipartisan congressional delegation"" visiting Iraq, arranged by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and led by Rep. Jerry McNerney.[58][59] Before the trip, Ellison told reporters that he would be stopping over in Germany to visit wounded U.S. soldiers being treated there.[58] He also stated that he respected any politician who visited Iraq, making note of Republican Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty who went in February, 2007, along with five other Governors.[58][60] Ellison said, ""If this country is going to ask these young people to stand in a war zone, their political leadership should visit them.""[58] In Iraq the delegation met with Iraqi and U.S. military officials, including Gen. David Petraeus.
Soon after returning home from his trip to Iraq, Ellison joined with 19 other representatives on a week-long trip to Israel sponsored by the American Israel Education Foundation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer led the group and personally invited Ellison to join them for a stay from August 1218, 2007.[61] The group met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Ellison's spokesperson told reporters that the trip was ""a natural extension of his visit to Iraq"" and that ""the Middle East peace issue is important to the diverse communities of his Minneapolis-area district  from the Jewish Community Relations Council to the patrons of the Holy Land Middle Eastern eatery on Lake Street and Central Avenue. He hears about it every time he goes back to his district."" The group traveled to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the northern Galilee region, and Ramallah, and viewed the Israeli border with Lebanon.[61]
During this trip, Ellison stated that Israel did not permit him to travel to Gaza, where a conflict was occurring.[62] In a 2009 interview with reporter Shihab Rattansi, Ellison expressed his disappointment at his inability to see the humanitarian situation for himself. In the same interview, he called for a more open discussion on Gaza, stating: ""The people who have a strong sympathy for the Israeli position... dominate the conversation. And its really not politically safe to say, look, there are two sides to this, and Israel has not been an angel in this, and certainly there have been people on the Palestinian side who have not contributed to a constructive solution.""[62]
During the Summer 2014 conflict between Hamas and Israel, Ellison published an editorial in The Washington Post that called for an end to the blockade in Gaza. Citing his 3 trips to Gaza since 2009, Ellison suggested that empowering Gazans by ending the blockade would weaken extremists and help move towards final status peace. [64]
On February 19, 2009, Ellison and fellow Representative Brian Baird visited Gaza to view firsthand the destruction from the Gaza War and to meet with international and local relief agencies, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. This visit, which Ellison and Baird say did not have the official sanction of the Obama Administration, was the first time any U.S. government official had entered Gaza in more than three years.[65] Ellison had this to say about what he saw:
The following day, Ellison and Baird visited the Israeli towns of Sderot and Ashkelon, which were the targets of numerous Qassam rocket attacks, repeatedly launched from within the Gaza strip.[66]
Ellison visited Norway in January 2008 because of Norway's prominent role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and because of the Norwegian-American heritage of many of his constituents. While there, Ellison met with former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, then president of the Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights. The Star Tribune reported that the ""trip underscores Ellison's desire to play a role in the international peace movement.""[67][68]
In mid-2008, Ellison joined a U.S. House Democracy Assistance Commission delegation that traveled to six African countries, including Liberia, Congo, Malawi, Mauritania and Kenya. ""The people of the 5th Congressional District [his own] know that, in this globalized world, to have peace and security relies on other people having a modicum of peace and security,"" Ellison said upon returning. He attended a July 4 reception at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Nairobi, Kenya, where Ellison met Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama, the step-grandmother of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.[69]
With his victory to the United States House of Representatives Ellison became the first Muslim elected to the Federal Government and the highest Muslim elected official in the United States, with Congressman Andr Carson elected in 2008, as the only other Muslim serving in the U.S. Congress.[70] Ellisons election has been seen as inspirational to American Muslims, and he encourages civic empowerment through participation in the political process.[71][72] Ellison generally ""downplayed the role of religion in his drive for office,""[73] but he has become active in advocacy for Muslim American civic engagement and civil rights causes on a national level since.[74][75][76][77]
On November 18, 2006, Ellison gave a speech called ""Imams and Politics"" to the Fourth Annual Body Meeting of the North American Imams Federation.[78] The Federation's materials presented the issues to be outlined in Ellison's speech as follows: ""Many Muslims around the United States are involved in political activities at different levels. Recognizing the sensitivity of political issues and the potential for divisiveness within the communities as a result of divergent political views, Imams must be able to provide Muslims with the proper guidance and educate them on the etiquettes of any political involvement within the Islamic context. Questions also arise on whether Imams and Islamic centers should be involved in politics at all and what the extent of this involvement should be, therefore Imams should have the ability to address these concerns. Overall, it is important that Imams are aware and understand the general political climate of their communities and be especially conversant with the issues that affect Muslims.""[78] Ellison also took part in ""Community Night"" with Imam Siraj Wahhaj, and Imam Dr. Omar Shahin. This was ""for Imams to meet and interact with community members.""[78] Some of the participants of this meeting became involved in the Flying Imams controversy after being removed from an Arizona bound plane for ""concerning behavior"".[79] Ellison became involved in this controversy shortly after it erupted when he attempted to arrange a meeting between parties including US Airways executives, the Metropolitan Airports Commission, and other legislators and community members.[80]
On December 27, 2006, Ellison spoke at a meeting in Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Detroit for Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength (MOSES). The meeting was with leaders from the Catholic, Muslim, and Arab-American communities, along with members of the organized labor movement. He told those in attendance that the principles of Islam guide his life, but he has no intention of imposing his faith on others, ""I'm not a religious leader, I've never led religious services of any kind. I'm not here to be a preacher, but in terms of political agenda items, my faith informs me.""[81] He addressed the Qur'an Oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress and said that he hoped religion could be a uniting, rather than a dividing force: ""They've never actually tried to explore how religion should connect us, they're into how religion divides us. ... They haven't really explored ... how my faith connects me to you.""[81]
Two months after taking office, Ellison met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top State Department officials to talk about ""showcasing his story as part of their public diplomacy efforts in the Muslim world.""[82] According to the Star Tribune, Ellison was ""profiled three times by the State Departments overseas press bureau."" He also ""did a Voice of America interview from his office, where an American flag was placed conspicuously behind his desk for the cameras.""[82] In the interview which was set to play in the Middle East and South Asia, Ellison stressed global inclusiveness and quoted verse 49:13 of the Qur'an ""Oh humanity, we created you from a single pair...""[82] Ellison also accepted the Bush administration's request to be part of a ""teleconference with Karen Hughes, the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy. The White House has asked that the teleconference promote American values and confront ideological support for terrorism around the world.""[82] The Voice of America applauded Ellison's cooperation saying ""He is the most famous freshman congressman in the world.""[82]
It was noted that after he took his oath of office he was surrounded by the foreign press, intrigued in part by the oath controversy, who ""had to be ushered out of his office after he took his oath to make room for home-state news crews.""[82] Ellison has been ""featured in a series of articles written for foreign dissemination by the Department's Bureau of International Information Programs.""[82] Including an article that was translated into Persian and Arabic that ""highlighted the diversity of his constituents in Minnesota, ranging from Swedes and Norwegians to 'the largest Somali immigrant community in America.'""[82] In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the US, saying things like ""religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately.""[82] Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying ""he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'""[82] Ellison staffers told reporters that ""the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war.""[82] When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said ""Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do whatever I can to make some friends for America.""[82]
Because Ellison converted to Islam from the Roman Catholic faith, he stated an intent to use the Qur'an instead of a Bible at his photo-op reenactment of the swearing-in ceremony (the official ceremony is done en masse without any books), conservative columnist Dennis Prager wrote a column criticizing his decision.[83] This drew responses from organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Family Association, and the Anti-Defamation League.
Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, responding to ""scores and hundreds of emails""[84] from his constituents after the Prager articles, has also stated his view that Ellison's decision to use the Qur'an is a threat to ""the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America"".[85] He also wrote, ""...if American citizens dont wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Qur'an.""
CNN reported that on the opening day of Congress, Ellison met Goode on the House floor to shake hands and Goode accepted an offer to talk over coffee.[86] That same day during his oath reenactment, Ellison used a two volume Qur'an once owned by Thomas Jefferson[87] and loaned to Ellison by ""the rare book and special collections division at the Library of Congress""; coincidentally, Jefferson's home at Monticello was actually located in Goode's district.[88] According to Ellison, ""it demonstrates that from the very beginning of our country, we had people who were visionary, who were religiously tolerant, who believed that knowledge and wisdom could be gleaned from any number of sources, including the Qur'an.""[89] Historian Kevin J. Hayes in his article How Thomas Jefferson Read the Qur'an explained that Jefferson purchased the book in 1765 while studying for the bar exam to become a lawyer.[90]
President Barack Obama in an address to nations with a majority Muslim population made in Cairo, Egypt on June 4, 2009 cited this event as an example of the continual positive impact Muslims have had on America, saying, ""And when the first Muslim-American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Qur'an that one of our Founding FathersThomas Jeffersonkept in his personal library.""[91]
On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News[92] said to Ellison, ""I have been nervous about this interview with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way."" Ellison replied that his constituents, ""know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to  need to prove my patriotic stripes.""
When asked by Beck about his opinion on ""Muslim extremists"" Ellison replied, ""They're criminals. But I think that people who commit criminal acts should be treated like criminals, regardless of their faith.""[92] Ellison has also said, ""Osama bin Laden no more represents Islam than Timothy McVeigh represented Christianity.""[93] Asked about the incident later, Ellison dismissed it, ""It's just shock TV. Some pundits think they have to ask the most outrageous questions.""[94]
On January 2, 2007, Beck said on his radio program that Ellison did not take offense at the comments and the two had a friendly chat off the air. On January 9, 2007, at the Television Critics Association's semiannual press tour, Beck said it was ""Quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time."" He clarified by saying, ""My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point that I make to my own faith, and that is  you must stand up before things get out of control ... And it's important for people of all faiths, when someone is hijacking their religion, to stand and say, 'That is not what we do. That is not who we are.""'[95]
As a law student in 1989 and 1990, Ellison wrote several columns under the name ""Keith E. Hakim"" in the student newspaper, the Minnesota Daily. Washington Post Staff Writer Alan Cooperman said that Ellison's articles ""defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism,"" and that Ellison ""called affirmative action a 'sneaky' form of compensation for slavery, suggesting instead that white Americans pay reparations to blacks.""[96][97][98]
During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Minnesota Republican operatives[96][99] raised questions about the articles and his involvement with the Nation of Islam. In response, Ellison wrote a letter to the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota & the Dakotas asserting he had never been a member, and that his connections with the Nation of Islam were limited to an 18-month period during which he helped organize the Minnesota contingent at the 1995 Million Man March.[24][96][100] In Ellison's letter, he denounced the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, writing ""I wrongly dismissed concerns that they [Farrakhan's remarks] were anti-Semitic. They were and are anti-Semitic and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did.""[101] He explained his previous views, saying that he ""did not adequately scrutinize the positions and statements of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed."" He also stated, ""any kind of discrimination and hate are wrong. This has always been my position"". During the 2006 campaign, many prominent Jewish DFL activists supported Ellison, including fundraisers Samuel and Sylvia Kaplan, and State Representative Phyllis Kahn, who said it was ""inconceivable that he could have ever been an anti-Semite.""[96]
During the 2006 election Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and James Yee, the former Muslim chaplain at Guantanamo Bay, spoke at an August 25 fundraiser for Ellison.[96][102] Awad and Ellison knew each other as they attended the University of Minnesota Law School at the same time.[5][103] According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Ellison accepted individual contributions from Nihad Awad and another leader of CAIR[not specific enough to verify]; Ellison responded that he had fully disclosed all contributions and asserted that he had ""nothing to hide"".[104] Ellison stressed that he was supported by individuals, and that the non-profit organization itself did not endorse his candidacy.[105]
His Republican opponent in the race, Alan Fine, criticized Ellison for accepting these contributions, asserting that CAIR was ""a group that Democrats say has deep ties to terrorism"".[106] In response to Ellison's opponents, CAIR leaders Parvez Ahmed and Nihad Awad wrote ""We are proud of our personal donations to Ellison's campaign"" and derided any 'guilt by association' arguments.[107]
In early 2006, the Minnesota State Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board reprimanded Ellison for unreported campaign contributions, discrepancies in cash balances, and misclassified disbursements during his campaigns for the Minnesota House of Representatives. These transgressions occurred in the years 200204. In 2005, the board opened an investigation, and Ellison was subpoenaed and fined.[108][109]
Ellison was repeatedly fined for late filings,[110] was sued twice by the Attorney General of Minnesota, and was warned about absent or incomplete disclosures.[24][96][111][112]
On July 8, 2007, Ellison discussed the power of the executive branch in a speech before the organization Atheists for Human Rights. He stated that Dick Cheney asserted it was ""beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship.""[113] He went on to say, ""It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan or anything like that because, you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box  dismiss you.""[113]
Fox News picked up the story[114] and their commentator John Gibson categorized Ellison's comments as accusing ""Bush of planning and executing the 9/11 attacks"".[115] In Congress, Representatives Eric Cantor and Zach Wamp wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding she ""swiftly and immediately"" reprimand Ellison for his remarks.[116] The letter said ""Even if Ellison asserts that he was not implying that 9/11 was orchestrated by the administration, the comparison he draws between Hitler and the President of United States is disgraceful. These comments inflame hatred and division at a time when we should be promoting our unity and reconciliation.""[116][117] The Anti-Defamation League also stated ""Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the war on terrorism, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and Nazism is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the war on terror. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated.""[116]
When later questioned about his comments, Ellison told a reporter that Osama bin Laden, and not the Bush administration, was responsible for the attacks.[118] Ellison also said, ""In the aftermath of a tragedy, space is opened up for governments to take action that they could not have achieved before that."" He pointed to the Iraq War and provisions granting greater arrest and surveillance powers within the USA PATRIOT Act as examples.[119] Ellison said also ""In response to a question, I stated that the Bush Administration exploited post-9/11 fears to advance a policy agenda that has undermined our civil liberties. I stand by this statement. ...I want to be clear that the murderous Nazi regime is historically distinct and the horror of the Holocaust must be acknowledged as a unique event in human history. I did not intend any direct comparison between the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany and the current administration. I have taken consistent and strong stands against Holocaust denial throughout my life in public service.""[116]
Representative Bill Sali of Idaho drew criticism for his comments in an August 8, 2007 interview with the conservative Christian-based American Family News Network. Sali, an outspoken Evangelical Christian, denounced the Senate leadership for allowing a Hindu to lead the opening prayer, claiming that the non-Christian invocation threatened to endanger America by removing ""the protective hand of God.""[120] He went on to say, ""We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate, we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now, Keith Ellison from Minnesota. Those are changes and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers. The principles that this country was built on, that have made it great over these centuries, were Christian principles derived from Scripture. You know the Lord can make the rain fall on the just and the unjust alike.""
Former Democratic Idaho congressman Richard Stallings, among others, demanded that Sali either apologize or resign. In response Sali sent Ellison an email saying he ""meant no offense.""[121] Ellison was in Iraq with a congressional delegation. His spokesperson said ""The congressman just doesn't respond to comments like that.""[122] Sali stressed to reporters that he was not calling for Ellison to be removed, saying, ""He got elected the same way I did. People certainly have the right to elect anyone they want"",[122] but he defended his claim about America's founding principles, saying, ""The idea that somehow we can move to multiculturalism and still remain the same  I think that's a little dangerous, too. From my standpoint, I believe the Founding Fathers were overwhelmingly Christian and the God they were talking about is the God of the Bible.""[122] When asked about his policy discussions with those of other faiths, Sali said, ""I would say, 'These are principles that I think are important,' and if he agrees with those, great. At the end of the game, maybe it does get down to religious beliefs and how they impact how you make public policy.""[122] It was noted in a New York Sun editorial that claims that the founders did not anticipate Muslim legislators are incorrect.[123] The specific subject was brought up in many of the State conventions to ratify the Constitution, including remarks by William Lancaster in the 1788 North Carolina Ratifying Convention.[123][124]
Ellison was chosen by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee for its Trailblazer Award. The group said Ellison ""has established a career of advocacy focused on promoting civil and human rights, peace, and prosperity for working families.""[125] He was named an Utne Reader visionary in 2011.[126]
In January 2014, Ellison's first book, My Country 'Tis of Thee,[127] was published.

William Mitchell College of Law","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Emmer","Tom Emmer","Republican","Minnesota House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","Thomas Earl ""Tom"" Emmer, Jr.[1] (born March 3, 1961) was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 2005 until 2011 and the Republican nominee for governor in the 2010 election. He represented District 19B, which includes portions of Wright and Hennepin Counties and the cities of Otsego, Albertville, St. Michael, Rockford, Delano, Montrose, and Waverly.[2] He was born in South Bend, Indiana, and grew up in Edina, Minnesota. On June 5, 2013, he announced he would seek the 6th Congressional District seat being vacated by Michele Bachmann.[3] He was seated as the US Representaive for the district in January 2015, after winning the general election.


Emmer attended St. Thomas Academy, an all-male, Catholic, military, college-preparatory high school, located in Mendota Heights near Saint Paul.[4] He then attended Boston College[2] followed by the University of Alaska at Fairbanks,[1] where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 1984. He also played hockey for both schools. He received a Juris Doctor from William Mitchell College of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1988.[5]
Prior to his election to the House, Emmer served as a member of the Independence and Delano City Councils.[2]
In 2004, incumbent Republican State Representative Dick Borrell, of Minnesota's 19B House District, decided to retire. Emmer decided to run and defeated Democrat Lori M. Schmidt, an attorney, 60%-40%.[6] In 2006, he won re-election to a second term with 61% of the vote.[7] In 2008, he won re-election to a third term with 61% of the vote.[8] In 2010, he decided to retire in order to run for Governor of Minnesota.
He served on the Finance Committee, the Health Care and Human Services Policy and Oversight Committee, and the State and Local Government Operations Reform, Technology and Elections Committee. He was also a member of the Finance Subcommittee for the Health Care and Human Services Finance Division, and of the Health Care and Human Services Policy and Oversight Subcommittee for the Licensing Division.[2]
Emmer officially announced his candidacy for governor of the State of Minnesota in July 2009.[9][10] In January 2010, Emmer came in second to Marty Seifert in a non-binding straw poll of Republican Party caucus participants.[citation needed] In April 2010, Emmer announced that his running mate would be Metropolitan Council member Annette Meeks. Emmer received the endorsements of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin,[11] Governor Tim Pawlenty, and Lieutenant Governor Carol Molnau.[12] On April 30, 2010, the Republican Party of Minnesota officially endorsed Tom Emmer as its candidate for governor at the state convention in Minneapolis. His main opponent, Marty Seifert, withdrew from the race and endorsed Emmer when it became apparent that Emmer was nearing the threshold for party endorsement. On August 10, 2010, Emmer won the Republican primary by a landslide of 82% of the vote, a 75-point margin over the distant second place candidate Bob Carney.[13][14]
The race attracted national attention as the ""first case in this election cycle of a company hit by national protests over a campaign donation"".[15] Minnesota-based Target Corporation donated $150,000 to Minnesota Forward, a new political action committee paying for advertising that supported Emmer's gubernatorial election.[16] Emmer said he viewed the Target giving as an exercise in free speech and wanted to keep his campaign focused on economic issues.[17] Best Buy also donated $100,000 to MN Forward.[18]
Emmer trailed by 9,000 votes behind his Democratic opponent Mark Dayton in the un-certified election results, though the count was close enough to trigger an automatic recount. Most analysts felt it was unlikely that the Emmer campaign could overcome such a deficit in a recount.[19] On December 8, 2010, Emmer conceded the election.[20]
Emmer was a registered lobbyist in Minnesota,[21] and co-hosted a morning talk radio program with Bob Davis on KTLK in Minneapolis.
In early 2011, he ran for an open Minnesota seat on the Republican National Committee, but lost that election to Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson.[22]
Emmer hosted a 2011 event promoting the launch of Representative Ron Paul's presidential campaign in Minnesota.[23]
Upon the surprise retirement of U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, Emmer was considered a possible successor in the Sixth Congressional District seat.[24] On June 5, 2013, Emmer officially announced he would seek the Republican nomination in the 2014 election. On February 4, Tom Emmer received 67.9% of the vote in the 6th district straw poll.[25][26] On April 12, 2014, he received the Republican Party endorsement for the nomination on the first ballot with 76%, but he still faced a primary challenge from his two competitors, Anoka County Board Chairwoman Rhonda Sivarajah and former state Rep. Phil Krinkie.[27] Emmer has received the endorsements of the Tea Party Express, Young Americans for Liberty's Liberty Action Fund, and many Minnesota legislators.[28][29] Emmer won the primary with 73% of the vote.
He has supported ""conscience clause"" legislation that would allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense contraception on the basis of ""ethical, moral or legal grounds as long as the pharmacist notifies their employer in advance and the employer can ensure a patient has timely access to the drug or device"".[32]
Emmer sponsored an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution that would allow the state to nullify federal laws.[33]
Emmer identifies as pro-life from conception to birth.[34]
Emmer strongly opposes tax increases. He has also proposed gradually reducing the state corporate tax, with the eventual goal of repealing it altogether.[35]
Emmer introduced an amendment within the Minnesota House of Representatives that would have eliminated Minnesota's minimum wage law in 2005.[36]
On July 5, 2010, after visiting a restaurant in St. Paul Minnesota, Emmer was asked during a press conference if he supported the idea of a tip credit, the financial policy of allowing businesses to subtract tips from a server's hourly wage. His response was ""Yes... if you didn't have a minimum wage law..."" His reasoning for implementing the tip credit is that ""...somebody could be taking home well over one hundred thousand dollars as a server"" while the restaurant owner could be making much less.[37][38]
One week after his tip credit press conference, Emmer announced a proposal that would exempt the first $20,000 a server makes in tips from state taxes.[39] At the same press conference a protester dumped $20 in pennies on Emmer's lap.[40]
In 2009, Emmer sponsored a bill that would shorten the period of license revocation for driving under the influence and for refusing to take a sobriety test. Additionally, though ""suspected drunken drivers [currently] face revocation before they go to court,"" Emmer's bill would delay revocations until after conviction.[41] Supporters of Emmer's bill have said ""it's needed because pre-conviction revocations penalize drivers before proving they're guilty.""[42] Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the head of the Minnesota DWI task force opposed the legislation[43] because it would allow arrested drivers to continue to drive during the time between their arrest and hearing.[44]
Emmer's own history became an issue in relation to his bill.[45] At age 20, Emmer received a driving under the influence-related ticket. In 1991 he pleaded guilty to careless driving while two charges for DWI and a license-plate violation were dropped.[46] Emmer denies that his own drunk driving and legal consequences played a part in the bill, stating, ""We all come to the Legislature with life experiences, but it has nothing to do with this bill.""[41] Emmer also stated that his sentence in 1981 should have been harsher. Had it been, Emmer felt that he ""...probably wouldn't have taken the second chance"" that led to his subsequent arrests and guilty plea in 1991.[47]
On May 13, 2010, Emmer was one of three legislators not to vote on a bill that would have provided such tougher penalties for drunk drivers. Emmer said that he missed the vote when a previously scheduled lunch ran long, and that he had ""no idea"" how he would have voted on the bill, but that he ""assume[d]"" he would have supported it.[48]
Emmer supported a state constitutional amendment banning civil recognition of same-sex marriages or its legal equivalent, stating, ""I believe marriage is the union between one man and one woman.""[49] In March 2007, Emmer introduced HF 1847, a proposed amendment to the Minnesota Constitution ""recognizing as marriage or its legal equivalent only a union between one man and one woman.""[50] Voters later rejected this proposal.
During an October 9, 2010, televised debate, Emmer said he would oppose legislation to combat school bullying against gay and lesbian young people. Emmer, who in the past voted against anti-bullying legislation as a state lawmaker, said that teachers are most responsible for halting bullies, but suggested that the threat of lawsuits keeps them from doing so. ""I don't think we need more laws; I think we need more understanding,"" he said.[51]
In 2009, Emmer voted against S.F. 247.[52] This Minnesota law states that by January 1, 2010, no manufacturer, retailer, or wholesaler may sell or offer for sale in Minnesota any children's product that contains Bisphenol-A, except for used children's products which will be prohibited after January 1, 2011.[53] Emmer stated that he voted against the law because of fear of increased costs. As well-intentioned as people may be, he said, ""they don't think about what this vote means five steps down the line.""[54]
The great-grandfather of Emmer, along with his two brothers, founded Emmer Brothers Lumber in 1910. It is now called Viking Forest Products LLC, an employee-owned company.[55] Emmer has seven children with his wife of more than 20 years, Jacqueline Emmer.[56] He is an avid hockey player, having played in college, and continuing the sport by coaching.[1] During the legislative session, Emmer regularly rode the bus to the Minnesota State Capitol.[1]"

Peterson was a member of the Minnesota Senate for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the Minnesota branch of the Democratic Party) from 1977 to 1986, representing a district in northwestern Minnesota. In 1976, he defeated Republican nominee Frank DeGroat 55%-45%.[1] In 1982, he won re-election against State Representative Cal Larson by just 200 votes, or 0.8% difference.[2]
In 1984, he ran for Minnesota's 7th congressional district in Northwestern Minnesota, held by Republican Arlan Stangeland. Peterson lost 57%43%.[3] In 1986, he ran in a rematch and narrowly lost by just 121 votes.[4] In 1988, he ran again but lost in the DFL primary to State Senator Marv Hanson 55%45%.[5] Hanson went on to lose to Stangeland 55%45%.
In 1990, he ran for a fourth time and won the primary. In the general election, he finally defeated seven-term incumbent Stangeland by 54%46%.[6] In 1992, he narrowly won re-election by a 50%49% margin against former State Representative Bernie Omann.[7] In a 1994 rematch, Peterson won again by a 51%49% margin, despite the Republican Revolution.[8] In 1996, he won re-election with 68% of the vote, and won every county in the district.[9] In 1998, he won re-election with 72% of the vote.[10]
In the 2000s, Peterson never faced a serious re-election challenge and only once did he win re-election with less than two-thirds of the vote. In 2000, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate against Republican Rod Grams, but he chose to run for re-election, winning with 69% of the vote.[11] In 2002, he won with 65% of the vote. In 2004, he won with 66% of the vote. In 2006, he won with 70% of the vote. In 2008, he won with 72% of the vote.
In 2010, Peterson survived another Republican wave election. This time, he defeated Lee Byberg 55%38%, his worst election performance since 1994.[12] In 2012, Peterson won re-election with 60.38% to Republican Lee Byberg's 34.85% and Independent Adam Steele's 4.67%.
In 2013, Republicans began pressuring Peterson, in hopes of convincing him to retire. His seat is one of only a handful that is represented by a Democrat but was carried by Mitt Romney in the 2012 election and is seen as a top pick-up opportunity should Peterson retire. Their tactics included airing television advertisements, hiring a press staffer to give opposition research to reporters, hiring a tracker to follow him around his district and record him, and sending mobile billboards with critical statements on them to drive around his hometown. Peterson responded by saying ""They don't have anybody else to go after. It's kind of ridiculous, but whatever.""[13][14] After Republicans spread rumors that Peterson was planning to buy a house in Florida and retire there, he said: ""I went from neutral on running again to 90 percent just because of this stupid stuff they're doing. You can't let these people be in charge of anything, in my opinion.""[15] On March 17, 2014, Peterson officially announced that he was running for re-election, saying, ""I still have a lot of work to do"".[16] Despite being heavily targeted by national Republican groups, Peterson defeated Republican State Senator Torrey Westrom in the general election by 54% to 46%.
In January 2015, Peterson stated that he is ""running at this point"" for re-election in 2016, saying that the efforts by Republicans to unseat him had ""energized me"" and ""got me fired up"".[17] In October 2014, he said that he may keep running until 2020 because the Republicans ""made me mad"" with their efforts to defeat him or persuade him to retire.[18]
Peterson was one of the original founders of the Blue Dog Coalition, the caucus of House Democrats who identify as moderates and conservatives.[19] He is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress and frequently crosses the party line.[20][21][22][23][24][25] In 2008, a report by Congressional Quarterly found he had the lowest party loyalty score over the previous five years of any member of the Minnesota congressional delegation.[26] In the 109th Congress, he was rated 50% conservative by a conservative group[27] and 57% progressive by a liberal group.[28]
Peterson is generally conservative on social issues; he strongly opposes abortion and has been one of the few Democrats to vote against embryonic stem cell research.[11][29] He has voted to ban physician assisted suicide and also to approve the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment to the United States Constitution.[30] He also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and supports the death penalty.[11][23]
The 7th contains some of the most conservative counties in the state and also the state's most rural district; many DFLers outside the Twin Cities are hunters and trappers who oppose gun control.[22][26] Peterson is a conservationist, but opposes ""excessive environmental regulation"" because he argues they harm farmers.[22] He is an avid hunter and supports animal trapping, but in 2000 he joined with The Humane Society of the United States to pass legislation that stopped the interstate shipping of birds for cockfighting.[11][31] He has an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association and is a ""staunch"" supporter of gun rights.[32]
Although he's been called a strong fiscal conservative,[26] he is somewhat closer to the liberal wing of his party on economic issues: he has voted against most free trade agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement,[22] the Freedom to Farm Act, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. He also voted against both versions of the Patriot Act and he has been sharply critical of the No Child Left Behind Act, which he contends is unfair to rural students.[21][22][33] He supports the FairTax, a national sales tax, estate-tax repeal, tort reform, and the Bush tax cuts. He voted against the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act.[21]
Peterson joined the House Republicans in voting against the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.[21]
In 1998, as part of an effort to change what were considered unequal fishing regulations between the U.S. and Canada, Peterson gained attention by proposing a constitutional amendment that would allow the residents of Minnesota's Northwest Angle to vote on whether they wanted to secede from the United States and join the Canadian province of Manitoba.[34] Peterson said that the amendment, which was part of a mock secession movement, was successful in bringing the issue to the attention of the White House: ""In just the day after I introduced (the amendment), people from the vice president's office have been asking questions, people in the White House (too). I've got meetings scheduled with the U.S. trade representative... we've educated people on both sides of the border, and I think we've brought it closer to the point where we'll get this thing resolved.""[35]
In 2003, he was one of just 16 Democrats to vote for President Bush's Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act.[21]
From 2003 through 2005, $14.7billion in crop subsidies went to the congressional districts of members on the House Committee on Agriculture, an analysis by the non-partisan Environmental Working Group found. That was 42.4% of the total subsidies. Peterson is reported to have brought $874million to his District.[36] In Peterson's district, which includes sugar beets, wheat and poultry, 58% of the $2.8billion paid out in crop subsidies from 1995 to 2005 went to 10% of recipients, according to the Environmental Working Group, which tracks farm spending. The chairman says he has no problem with that. ""Ten percent of the farmers produce 90% of the food,"" he says.
In 2004, he joined with Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch in suing the state of North Dakota over what they argued were discriminatory laws that forbid non-North Dakota residents from hunting during the first week of the waterfowl hunting season.[37] Their case was rejected by the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, a decision which was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.[38]
In January 2005, he was selected by the House Democratic Caucus to succeed former Texas Congressman Charlie Stenholm as the Ranking Member on the Committee on Agriculture. He became the committee's chairman after the Democrats won control of the House two years later.
Peterson was a cosponsor of the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005[39][40] which would provide job protection for three million illegal immigrant agricultural workers and their families, and extend the visas of legal immigrant agricultural workers.
In December 2005, Peterson joined four Republicans to form the Second Amendments, a rock and country band.[41]
Along with John Conyers, in April 2006 Peterson brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.[42] The case (Conyers v. Bush) was ultimately dismissed.[43]
Peterson was one of the few Democrats to vote in favor of the Military Commissions Act of 2006.[44]
In May 2007, Peterson was the lone Democrat to vote against the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act.[45]
On January 28, 2009, Peterson was amongst the seven Democrats who voted in the House together with the unanimous Republican opposition against President Obama's stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009).[46][47]
In April 2009, Peterson voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.[48]
On May 6, 2009, Peterson voiced his opposition to climate change legislation proposed by the Obama Administration saying, ""I will not support any kind of climate change bill  even if you fix this  because I don't trust anybody anymore. I've had it."" Peterson predicted that an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to assess indirect effects of ethanol production on greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the climate change legislation, could ""kill off corn ethanol.""[49]
On July 27, 2009, a controversy erupted after Peterson was quoted in a Politico.com article saying, ""25 percent of my people believe the Pentagon and Rumsfeld were responsible for taking the twin towers down. That's why I don't do town meetings."" The state Republican Party denounced the remark as ""outrageous and offensive"". Peterson apologized for the comment, which he described as ""off-hand"".[50]
On March 21, 2010, Peterson voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[51]
In 2010, he was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee[52] and the National Rifle Association.[53]
In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.[54] The bill contained an exception for ""forcible rape,"" which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape.[55] The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest.[54]
Peterson lives in Detroit Lakes, just east of Moorhead. He is divorced and previously dated former Congresswoman Katherine Harris, the former Republican Secretary of State of Florida.[22] He is a licensed private pilot and frequently travels by private plane across his district.[11][22]"

A member of the Minnesota DemocraticFarmerLabor Party, he previously served as the U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 6th congressional district from 1975 to 1981. After re-entering politics in 2011, he was nominated to challenge first-term incumbent Republican Chip Cravaack in the 8th district,[1] defeating Cravaack on November 6, 2012.[2]


Nolan was born in Brainerd, Minnesota and graduated from Brainerd High School in 1962. His aunt was a district judge, whom Nolan called his biggest political influence growing up.[3] He attended St. Johns University in Collegeville, Minnesota the following year, but completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, earning his B.A. in 1966. Nolan pursued postgraduate work in public administration and policy formation at the University of Maryland, College Park, and in education at St. Cloud State University.[4]
Early in his career he served as a staff assistant to Walter Mondale in the United States Senate,[5] and was a teacher of social studies in Royalton, Minnesota.[4] In 1968, he campaigned for presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy.[3]
Nolan was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1968 and served two terms (1969-72), representing House District 53A (Morrison County). His uncle Martin J. McGowan, Jr. also served in the Minnesota Legislature.[6] He then ran unsuccessfully for Minnesota's 6th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1972, but was elected in his second run in 1974 to the 94th Congress and reelected to the 95th and the 96th.
In 1979, he broke with his party in endorsing Senator Ted Kennedy for President over the sitting Democratic President Jimmy Carter.[5][7]
In 2007, he endorsed Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd in his campaign for President of the United States, and traveled the state of Iowa campaigning on his behalf.[8]
Nolan decided not to run for reelection in 1980, and served as president of the U.S. Export Corporation until 1986, and was later appointed to and became president of the Minnesota World Trade Center, a private-public initiative, by then-Democratic Party chairman Governor Rudy Perpich from 1987 to 1994.[4][6] The National Journal reported that ""his Republican foes criticized his $70,000 salary, which they considered high for a civil servant at the time, and the budget deficits the company ran up."" [3] He has also served as chairman of the Mission Township[9] Planning Committee, president and board member of the Central Lakes College foundation, to which he helped direct federal funding,[10] and lecturer and volunteer for the Initiative Foundation on Serving in Public Office.[citation needed] Nolan is also the former owner of Emily Wood Products, a small sawmill and pallet factory in the northern Minnesota community of Emily.[3] His daughter and son-in-law now own and operate the enterprise.[11]
Nolan announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives on July 12, 2011, challenging incumbent Chip Cravaack in Minnesota's 8th congressional district.[12] He won the Democratic primary in August 2012, defeating Tarryl Clark and Jeff Anderson.[13][14] The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent about $2 million on his campaign, and the liberal House Majority PAC spent another $1.5 million.[15] Nolan defeated Cravaack, 191,976 to 160,520, to return to Congress after a 32-year absence.
Nolan ran for re-election in 2014. The Democratic primary took place on August 12, 2014 and the general election on November 4, 2014. He was challenged by Republican nominee Stewart Mills III.[16][17] According to Politico, Nolan was a vulnerable Democrat in a competitive congressional district. He was targeted by Americans for Prosperity over his support of the Affordable Care Act. However, he was successful in his close re-election bid, defeating Mills 129,090 to 125,358.[18]
Nolan has stated his belief that guns are important but certain limitations on gun access are important.[19] In January 2013, Rick Nolan called the assault weapon ban, which expired in 2004, common sense legislation, saying he didnt need an assault weapon to kill a duck.[20]
Nolan has voiced opposition to the proposed route of the Enbridge Sandpiper Pipeline, saying it poses environmental risks to vulnerable wetlands and drinking water in northern Minnesota.[21]
Nolan voted against an amendment requiring a study of the vulnerabilities of the Keystone XL pipeline to a terrorist attack and certification that necessary protections have been put in place.[22]
Nolan supports increased federal investment in the mining industry, including a $250 million-a-year research center that would look at newer, cheaper and more environmentally friendly ways of extracting resources from the region.[23] He also advocates speeding up the environmental review process for mining companies.[23]
During a debate in 2012, Nolan said that taxes should be raised and that provisions in the tax code that encourage offshoring should be eliminated. Nolan also said that the ""super-rich"" in particular should be targeted for tax increases.[24]
Nolan has voiced support for the stimulus spending championed by President Obama. He said, ""It did in fact create good jobs in a whole wide range of areas, not the least of which is in the field of transportation.""[25]
On October 1, 2013, Nolan introduced a bill that would withhold the pay of members of Congress during a government shutdown, in response to the shutdown that had gone into effect that morning. Its time for Congress to start living in the real world - where you either do your job, or you dont get paid, he said concerning the bill, which stood in opposition to the 27th Amendment to the Constitution.[26]
In June 2014, Nolan and Republican David McKinley introduced the Health Care Fairness and Flexibility Act, which would delay an Affordable Care Act fee on every person covered by large self-insured employers and insurance companies. According to the Duluth News Tribune, ""The effort marks a rare bit of bipartisan cooperation in Washington when it comes to legislation, especially regarding the presidents signature law.""[27]
Nolan supports the Affordable Care Act and said he would not vote to repeal it. Nolan said, ""It ensures that another 30 million people in this country would have health insurance; it provides that nobody can be denied as a result of preconditions; it provides that parents can keep their children insured up to the age of 26.""[28]
Nolan was one of four members of Congress to vote against the 2014 Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. The bill allocates $73.3 billion to veterans programs and military construction projects, ""$1.4 billion more than what Congress budgeted last year."" In a statement, Nolan said, ""I voted against the bill in protest, because it under-funds veterans health and benefit programs, while shoveling billions of new dollars into unnecessary new military construction in places all around the world where American presence and American resources do not belong.""[29]
In 2014, Nolan urged President Obama to resist further military intervention in both Syria and Iraq.[30][31][32]
Nolan voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which prohibits abortions after 20 weeks.[33]
Given his previous six years of service, Nolan's chamber seniority has placed him at 235 out of 433 members.[34]
Rick Nolan sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and four of its Subcommittees: (1) Highways and Transit; (2) Aviation; (3) Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management; and (4) Water Resources and the Environment.[35] He also serves on the House Agriculture Committee and two of its Subcommittees: (1) Conservation, Energy and Forestry, and (2) Livestock, Rural Development, and Credit.[35]
Nolan has previously served on the House Small Business Committee and the House Agriculture Committee; his previous appointments would have earned him some Committee Seniority on these committees that he had already served on[36] in the 94th, 95th and 96th Congresses.[37] Instead, Nolan will now have Committee Seniority on only the House Agriculture Committee and be a junior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Nolan had been quoted as saying he would like to serve on ""the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, along with the Natural Resources Committee, which hears legislation that directly affects the mining, forestry, agriculture and tourism-based economy of the Eighth Congressional District."".[38][39]
Nolan is divorced from Marjorie Nolan, but has been married to current wife Mary for 30 years. He has four children.[41][42]"

Jackson State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennie_Thompson","Bennie Thompson","Democratic","alderman, mayor of Bolton, Hinds County Board of Supervisors","United Methodist","Bennie Gordon Thompson (born January 28, 1948) is the U.S. Representative for Mississippi's 2nd congressional district, serving since 1993, and the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security since 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party.[1]
The district includes most of Jackson and is the only majority-black district in the state. The district is approximately 275 miles (443km) long, 180 miles (290km) wide and borders the Mississippi River. The Mississippi Delta comprises the vast majority of the 2nd District. He is both the first Democrat and the first African American to chair the Homeland Security Committee in the House.


Thompson is a lifelong resident of Bolton, near Jackson. He attended Hinds County public schools before earning a B.A. in political science from Tougaloo College in 1968 and an M.S. in educational administration from Jackson State University in 1973. He served as an alderman, then mayor of Bolton before being elected to the Hinds County Board of Supervisors.
Thompson also belongs to the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congressional Rural Caucus, Congressional Sunbelt Caucus, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Caucus, Congressional Travel & Tourism Caucus, and the Tennessee Valley Authority Caucus. He also is involved in the Congressional Children's Working Group and the National Guard & Reserve Components Congressional Members Organization.
Thompson entered a crowded seven-way special election held on April 13, 1993 after Mike Espy gave up the seat to become Secretary of Agriculture. With five other Democrats splitting the vote, he finished second behind Republican Hayes Dent with 28 percent of the vote. He then defeated Dent in the April 13 runoff with 55 percent of the vote. He won the seat in his own right in 1994 and has been reelected eight times. He has only faced serious opposition twice, when journalist Clinton LeSueur held him to 55 percent in 2002 and 58 percent in 2004.
Thompson became an outspoken advocate for the Gulf Coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit in 2005. From his position on the Homeland Security Committee, he pushed for accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a careful review of the role of the Red Cross in the time of disaster. He also pursued waste, fraud, and abuse in hurricane contracting and called for preferences to be given to small and Gulf Coast businesses in the recovery and rebuilding of the affected states. Thompson is the founding Member of the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery & Rebuilding Caucus in the House of Representatives.
Thompson's voting record has been decidedly liberal; he is arguably one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent Mississippi. He is a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. His legislative platform focuses mainly on homeland security, civil rights, agriculture and rural issues, equal education and health care reform. In 1975, he became one of the original plaintiffs in the Ayers Case, which concerned the adequate funding of predominantly black educational institutes in Mississippi. In 2000, Thompson wrote legislation that created the National Center for Minority Health and Health Care Disparities.
During his tenure as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Thompson focused on assuring that state and local officials, as well as first responders (fire, police, EMTs), got the resources they needed to protect their communities. Thompson was particularly concerned about local officials getting adequate resources, having been a volunteer firefighter and a local elected official for 24 years.
He was one of the 31 who voted in the House to refuse to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election. [1]
Along with John Conyers, in April 2006, Thompson brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.[2] The case (Conyers v. Bush) was ultimately dismissed.[3]
On January 5, 2007, Thompson introduced H.R.1, ""Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007,"" the first bill of the 110th Congress. The bill, cosponsored by more than 100 House Members, provided for the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's remaining recommendations. It included provisions requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism. The bill had bipartisan support and passed 299-128 on January 9, 2007. On July 27, 2007, the Conference Report on H.R. 1 passed the House overwhelmingly, 371-40. The previous day, it had passed the Senate 85-8. The President signed H.R. 1 into law on August 3, 2007.
With the passage of H.R. 1, Thompson is the first African-American Chairman of a House Committee to have a House-Senate Conference on the first bill introduced in either the House or the Senate in any given Congress.
On December 27, 2009, commenting on reports that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who had allegedly tried to set off a suicide bomb on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, had subsequently confessed to being trained and equipped in Yemen,[4][5] Thompson called for a halt to all current plans with regard to Yemen in light of Abdulmutullab's ties there, including plans to repatriate approximately 80 Yemeni captives in Guantanamo.
Thompson is a supporter, and one of the proposers of, a recent proposed bill to prevent auto insurance companies from using credit scores to set auto insurance rates. The result of this bill if passed would be drastically lowered auto insurance rates to help Americans already in financial struggle. Auto insurance rates would be more based solely on factors directly related to auto mobility instead of arbitrary factors such as debt or poor credit elsewhere.[6]
Thompson has also been a supporter of a measure to increase screening and background checks for pilot trainees to reduce chances of terrorist exploitation. The bill, H.R. 6159 would require all applicants to go through a waiting period while they were screened and cleared by the Department of Homeland Security. Currently only foreign born trainees are required to go through this screening, but this bill would extend the precautions taken to all American applicants.[7][8]
Thompson joined hands with Senator Ron Wyden and introduced a bill to limit the number of documents that are classified and to overhaul the security clearance system in July 2014. The bill's fate is currently unclear.[9]
Thompson joined the House of Representatives in April 1993, after winning a special election for the 2nd Congressional seat, which became vacant when Representative Mike Espy resigned. He was elected to a full term in 1994, and has been reelected six times.
Thompson has had very successful campaign financing and has raised about 1.2 million dollars. This is about 200 times the amount raised by his closest competitor, Republican Bill Marcy. He has spent much of these funds on television, radio, and print advertisement for his campaign.[11]
Thompson is married to the former London Johnson of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and has one daughter, BendaLonne, one granddaughter, Jeanna. and one grandson, Thomas. Thompson is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity (Gamma Rho - Tougaloo College) and a lifetime member of the Asbury United Methodist Church in Bolton."

Other cities in the district include Meridian, Natchez, Starkville, and Brookhaven.


Harper was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He spent eight years working as Chairman of the Rankin County, Mississippi Republican Party, and served as a delegate to the 2000 Republican National Convention. He was appointed by the party as an observer during the controversial 2000 Florida presidential recount.
Harper graduated from Mississippi College in 1978 with a degree in Chemistry and from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981. He has worked as a private practice attorney since receiving this degree. He was the prosecuting attorney for the cities of Brandon, Mississippi and Richland, Mississippi.[1]
As for his personal life, he is a deacon of Crossgates Baptist Church in Brandon, Mississippi, where he had also been a Sunday School teacher.
Harper introduced the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (H.R. 2019; 113th Congress) into the House on May 16, 2013.[2] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[3][4] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[4][3] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[5]
Gregg Harper won the Republican nomination in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district on April 1, 2008 with 57% of the vote.[6] This was tantamount to election in this heavily Republican district. He defeated his Democratic opponent, Joel Gill in the November General Election winning 63% of the vote.[7]"

The district takes in most of Mississippi's share of the Gulf Coast and includes Biloxi, Gulfport, Pascagoula, Laurel and Hattiesburg. He is a member of the Republican Party. Palazzo defeated 10-term Democratic incumbent Gene Taylor with 52% to 47% of the vote in the 2010 mid-term election. Previously, he served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, having represented District 116 from 2006 to 2011. Palazzo again defeated Taylor in the June 2014 Republican primary election. Taylor switched parties in a bid to return to his former House seat.[3]


Palazzo was born February 21, 1970 in Gulfport.[4] He enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1988, and served with the 3rd Force Reconnaissance Company in the Persian Gulf War. He currently serves in the Mississippi Army National Guard. He received a Bachelor's and MPA from the University of Southern Mississippi, and is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He is a Certified Public Accountant.
In April 2006, incumbent Republican State Representative Leonard Bentz of Mississippi's 116th House District resigned because he was appointed to the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Palazzo defeated Democratic candidate Maryann Graczyk, an education lobbyist, and Republican George Emile, a funeral home director, 51%-26%-24%.[5] In 2007, running unopposed, he was elected to a full term.[6]
Palazzo was awarded the 2009 Elected Official of the Year from the MS Wildlife Federation. The Mississippi Business Journal and the Sun Herald (2005) named Palazzo as a Top Business Leader under 40.[7]
He served on the Banking and Financial Services, Juvenile Justice, Labor, Select Committee on the Gulf Coast Disaster, and the Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Committees.[4]
Palazzo entered the Republican primary for Mississippi's 4th congressional district and won the nomination with 57% of the vote. He faced 10-term Democratic incumbent Gene Taylor in the general election. Although the 4th has turned almost solidly Republican at the federal level, Taylor had held the seat without serious difficulty. His voting record had been very conservative even by Mississippi Democratic standards, and he'd often broken with his party. Palazzo established himself as Taylor's strongest opponent since 1996. In particular, he attacked Taylor for supporting Nancy Pelosi for House Speaker in 2006 and 2008.[8] He was endorsed by Sarah Palin and in the November 2010 general election, Palazzo defeated Taylor 52%-47%.[9]
In the Republican primary, he defeated two challengers with 74% of the vote.[10] In the November election, he defeated Democratic candidate Matthew Moore 64%-29%.[11]

Palazzo won 50.5% of the vote while Taylor won 43% of the vote. Three minor candidates made up the reamianing percentage. Taylor actively campaigned and drew large numbers of Democrats into the Republican Primary.[12] Palazzo was targeted by the Club for Growth.[13]
On Nov. 4th 2014, Palazzo easliy defeated Democrat Challenger Matt Moore 69.9% to 24.3% four minor party or independent candidates accounted for 3.8% of the vote. He had previously defeated Moore in 2012 64%-29%.[14]

Palazzo was one of the initial co-sponsors of the Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 (H.R. 4263; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Secretary of Homeland Security to establish within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group (the Group) to provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack.[15] Palazzo stated that ""social media has played a crucial role in emergency preparedness and response in Mississippi, including during disasters like Hurricane Isaac and the tornadoes that hit the Hattiesburg area a little over a year ago.""[16] He said that their goal with the bill was to ""build upon existing public-private partnerships and use social media in a more strategic way in order to help save lives and property.""[16]
On April 7, 2014, Palazzo introduced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4412; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize the appropriation of $17.6 billion in fiscal year 2014 to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[17][18] NASA would use the funding for human exploration of space, the Space Launch System, the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle, the commercial crew program, the International Space Station (ISS), and various technological and educational projects.[17][19] Palazzo said that ""American leadership in space depends on our ability to put people and sound policy ahead of politics.""[19]

Harvard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lacy_Clay,_Jr.","William Clay","Democratic","Missouri State Legislature","Roman Catholic","William Lacy Clay, Jr. (born July 27, 1956), usually known as Lacy Clay, is the U.S. Representative for Missouri's 1st congressional district, serving since 2001. He is a member of the Democratic Party.
The district is based in the city of St. Louis and includes most of northern St. Louis County (North County), taking in cities such as Maryland Heights, University City, and Florissant.


Clay, Jr. was born in St. Louis, Missouri,[1] but his family moved to Washington, D.C. when his father, Bill Clay, was elected to U.S. Congress. His mother was Carol Ann (Johnson).[2]
In his teenage years, Clay Jr. attended public schools in Silver Spring, Maryland and graduated in the Springbrook High School Class of 1974. He then attended the University of Maryland-College Park, from which he earned a degree in political science and certification to be a paralegal. Clay is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.
Clay entered the Missouri House of Representatives in 1983, the same year that he graduated. In 1991, he was elected to the Missouri Senate.
In 2000, Clay, Sr. retired after 32 years in the U.S. Congress. Clay, Jr. won a crowded six-way Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic districtwith 60 percent of the vote, and breezed to election in November. He has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 70 percent of the vote.
For his first six terms, Clay, Jr. represented the northern two-thirds of St. Louis, while the southern third was located in the 3rd district, represented by fellow Democrat Russ Carnahan. However, Missouri lost a congressional district as a result of the 2010 Census. The final map resulted in the 3rd district being eliminated and the 1st district absorbing all of St. Louis.[3] Clay beat Carnahan in the August 7, 2012 primary, 63% to 34%--all but handing him a seventh term.[4][5]
Since his first term, Clay has been a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He currently chairs the House Information Policy Subcommittee. He is also a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Ordinarily, House Democrats who serve on the Financial Services Committee would have to give up their other committee assignments. However, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Financial Services Committee Chair Barney Frank of Massachusetts granted him a waiver allowing him to remain on the Oversight Committee.
Clay made headlines in early 2007 when, as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus (co-founded by his father), he objected to the possible inclusion of U.S. Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, a Caucasian who represents the majority-African American district in Memphis and had made a campaign promise to attempt to become the first white member of the CBC. Although it is not part of the CBC's bylaws that members must be black, all members so far have been black.[6] Clay told Cohen ""that he could not collaborate with the Congressional Black Caucus for the benefit of his black constituents 'until your skin turns black.'""[7] In response to press inquiries, he said, ""Mr. Cohen asked for admission, and he got his answer. He's white and the Caucus is black. It's time to move on. We have racial policies to pursue and we are pursuing them, as Mr. Cohen has learned. It's an unwritten rule. It's understood."" In response to the decision, Cohen stated, ""It's their caucus and they do things their way. You don't force your way in.""[6] Clay issued an official statement from his office in reply to Cohen's complaint: ""Quite simply, Rep. Cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept  there has been an unofficial Congressional White Caucus for over 200 years, and now it's our turn to say who can join 'the club.' He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria, unless he can change his skin color. Primarily, we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population, and we will not allow white America to infringe on those objectives."" Some have said that since Cohen represents a district with 60 percent of African American voters, that he has a legitimate interest in helping the goals of the CBC, and the decision should not be solely based on skin color.[6]
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington issued a report in June 2007 saying that Clay's sister Michelle Clay is a registered lobbyist for the Kansas City airport and previously for the city of St. Louis. They reported that in the 2006 election cycle, Michelle Clay's law office, Clay and Associates, received $51,800 in consulting fees from her brother's campaign funds, along with an additional $9,963 for reimbursements. In the 2004 election cycle, Michelle Clay's firm received $52,514 for consulting, and in 2002 Michelle Clay herself was paid $32,00 for campaign management and legal fees. During the 2004 election, Clay's campaign reimbursed his father more than $6,000 for book purchases.[8]
Clay, Jr.'s voting record has been decidedly progressive, like that of his father. He is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which his father was a founding member.
During Clay's previous seventeen years in the state legislature, he authored Missouri's Hate Crimes Law which included gender, sexual orientation and sexual identity in the criteria of what constitutes a hate crime.
Clay made it clear that he supports the Employment Non-discrimination Act which would make it illegal to discriminate against employees of any sexual orientation, notably LGBT workers. He also noted that he believes that the 33 states that are allowed to fire employees due to sexual orientation are in the wrong.
Clay has been a consistent critic of the War in Iraq and was among those who voted against the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. Clay's NPAT also displays disagreement with elements of the War on Drugs. He believes that government reform is necessary to make sure every citizen's voice is heard. Clay also continues to fight for programs that will improve that status of the poor, including initiatives to allow lower-class people to purchase homes.
Clay is also active in election reform and believes that any electronic voting system must include a paper trail to verify the results.
Clay added his name as cosponsor to a bill calling for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney, House Resolution 333.
He was one of the 31 members in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[9]
Lacy Clay voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.[10]
Clay is a supporter of the Federal Reserve's program of quantitative easing and claims that it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2008.[11]
Clay married his wife Ivie in 1992, when he was a state senator.[13] He filed for divorce in 2009.[14] Ivie initially found out about the divorce ""only through the media.""[13] After Clay had the court file sealed, Ivie released the following statement to the media:
I and my children are devastated and embarrassed that my husband let us find out from the childrens friends and the media that he had filed for divorce, and mostly that he still has not contacted our children. I would have wanted to prepare the children. I have been a loving, supportive wife throughout our 17-year marriage. I have raised the children and held down the fort so that my husband could work 4 days a week, first in Jefferson City and now in Washington, DC, travel overseas, and do everything required to fulfill the duties of his elected office  all while working my own full-time job. [13]
Clay responded today, saying:
""This is a time of great sadness for my family and me. My wife and I have been discussing this situation for a number of months and this action should not have come as a surprise to anyone. Of course, my first concern is for our children, whom I love dearly, and for their peace & privacy. I will continue to be a devoted father to them, and I hope that the public will understand that this is a difficult, private family matter that will hopefully be resolved amicable and swiftly by all parties."" [13]
The Clays have two children Will and Carol.[14]"

The district includes most of St. Louis' southern and western suburbs.
Previously, she served as the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg from 2005 to 2009. Prior to her diplomatic post, Wagner was Chair of the Missouri Republican Party for six years, from 1999 until 2005, and Co-chair of the Republican National Committee for four years.


Wagner was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, attended the all-girls' Cor Jesu Academy, and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1984 with a BSBA from the Business School with an emphasis in Logistics. After college, Ann went to work in the private sector and held management positions at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City and Ralston Purina in St. Louis.[2]
Wagner entered Republican politics in 1990, heading the GOP's efforts during the decennial redistricting of Missouri. In 1992 she was state director of the campaign for the re-election of President George H.W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle.
She was elected to her first term of office as chair of the Missouri party in 1999, becoming the first woman to occupy the position. Her most notable achievement in that role came during her second two-year term when she oversaw the party's taking of majority control of both chambers of the Missouri General Assembly, winning the Senate in a 2001 special election and the House in the 2002 general election, the first time this had been seen for over 40 years. During her third term, the party held its majorities in both chambers and also took the Governor's seat for the first time in 12 years with the election of Matt Blunt in 2004, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1921. Her six years as chairwoman saw George W. Bush carry Missouri in both of his presidential bids, and also saw the Republican win a majority of the state's congressional delegation.
In 2001 she took office as a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and helped preside over the 2004 Republican National Convention. In this role she took a strong role in directing the development of the Winning Women initiative, whose aim was to improve the image of the GOP towards women and demonstrate the relevance of its platform to them. Her work with the committee took her to 48 states. In January 2005, she left her role as co-chair after one term.
In 2004, Wagner was a fundraising ""ranger"" for President George W. Bush.
On February 20, 2005, Wagner was elected to a fourth term as Chair of the state GOP. On May 16 she was nominated by President Bush to the position of United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. She had no previous diplomatic experience. On July 16, 2005 she was confirmed in the post by a voice vote in the United States Senate, after which Senator Jim Talent (R-Mo) said that she was, ""A considerate woman, whose character and abilities uniquely qualify her to represent our nation.""
On August 1 she was sworn in as Ambassador by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the Benjamin Franklin Room of the Harry S. Truman Building of the US Department of State in Washington D.C..[3]
After returning from Luxembourg, Wagner served as Chairman for Roy Blunt's successful 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. Blunt defeated Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan 54%-41%.
On November 29, 2010, Wagner sent a video message to the committee members of the Republican National Committee announcing she was running for RNC Chair.[4] The election was held in January 2011,[5] and Wagner conceded after the sixth round after receiving 17 votes[6] The contest was won by Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party.
Wagner announced her candidacy for Missouri's 2nd congressional district after incumbent Todd Akin announced he would not run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012. She received endorsements from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, and the pro-life women's group the Susan B. Anthony List. She won the four-candidate Republican primarythe real contest in this strongly Republican districtwith 66% of the vote.[7] In November, she defeated Democratic nominee Glenn Koenen 60%-37%.[8] She is the third Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri (after Jo Ann Emerson and Vicky Hartzler), and the second who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband (after Hartzler; Emerson was originally elected to finish out the term of her late husband, Bill Emerson).
The following is an incomplete list of legislation sponsored by Rep. Wagner.
Wagner is married to Ray Wagner, a former Missouri director of revenue, and has three children: Raymond III, a recent West Point graduate stationed at Fort Campbell with the 101st Airborne, Stephen, a senior at Washington University in St. Louis and Mary Ruth, a sophomore at Miami University. [2] They live in Ballwin, a wealthy suburb of St. Louis.
She has been involved with a number of charities in the St. Louis area, including the Foster Care Coalition and the American Red Cross.
Congresswoman Wagner recently spoke at a Ripon Society forum and addressed the 2013 IRS scandal and tax reform. Wagner stated that it was the Administration's lack of oversight and connection to the issue that has caused these problems. [It is] ""...a failure of leadership when you have a president who is so disconnected -- not from our conference and our party, but from his own Democrat Party and other leadership here on the Hill. This is the trickledown effect of real arrogance here.""[13]
On July 24, 2013, Wagner voted to continue funding NSA surveillance.
On September 30, 2013, after the beginning of the government shutdown, Wagner asked for her pay to be withheld.[14]"

He represented Missouri's 9th congressional district from 2009 to 2013, until that district was eliminated as a result of the 2010 Census. The district contains most of Northeastern Missouri. Luetkemeyer is a member of the Republican Party.


Luetkemeyer was born in Jefferson City, Missouri on May 7, 1952.[1] He attended Lincoln University in Jefferson City and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and with a minor in business administration. A lifelong farmer who is the fourth generation of his family to own their farm, Luetkemeyer has also owned several small businesses, as well as running a bank and serving as an insurance agent. He also served on the Board of Trustees for the village of St. Elizabeth.
In 1998, Luetkemeyer was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives from the 115th district.[2] During his time as a state representative, Luetkemeyer served as chair of the Financial Services Committee and as House Republican Caucus Chairman. During his time in the state legislature, Luetkemeyer co-sponsored the statewide constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between a man and a woman, which was overwhelmingly approved by Missouri voters statewide in 2004 by a margin of 71-29. He also worked on legislation which allowed Missourians to carry concealed firearms, banned partial-birth abortions, and reformed worker compensation laws.
In 2004, he did not seek reelection but instead was one of seven Republicans who ran for the office of State Treasurer. He finished second in the Republican primary, losing to Sarah Steelman who went on to win the general election. In 2005, Luetkemeyer was appointed by former Governor Matt Blunt to serve as Missouri Tourism Director, a post he held until running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008. One of his projects was working with Blunt and Lt. Governor Peter Kinder to start the Tour of Missouri, a cycling event modeled on the Tour de France.[citation needed]
In 2008, Luetkemeyer defeated Democrat Judy Baker and Libertarian Party candidate Tamara Millay for the seat vacated by Kenny Hulshof.[3]
Luetkemeyer defeated Libertarian nominee Christopher W. Dwyer and write-in candidates Jeff Reed and Ron Burrus.
Luetkemeyer claimed 63.5% of the vote in defeating Democrat Eric C. Mayer (32.9%), and Libertarian Steven Wilson (3.7%).[4]
On October 23, 2013, Luetkemeyer introduced the bill To enhance the ability of community financial institutions to foster economic growth and serve their communities, boost small businesses, increase individual savings (H.R. 3329; 113th Congress) into the House.[5] The bill would direct the Federal Reserve to revise certain regulations related to small bank holding companies (BHCs).[6][7] Current regulations allow BHCs with assets of less than $500 million that satisfy other tests to incur higher amounts of debt than larger institutions in order to acquire other banks.[6] H.R. 3329 would apply the less-stringent standard to more BHCs by raising the asset limit to $1 billion, and the bill also would allow savings and loan holding companies to qualify.[6]
On June 26 2014, Luetkemeyer introduced H.R.4986, that would end the controversial Operation Choke Point[8] which was designed to limit the activities of money launderers, but has come under criticism for alleged abuse.[9] Later, on November 20, 2014, in a further effort to end Operation Choke Point, Luetkemeyer introduced additional legislation that would require federal banking agencies to put in writing any suggestion or order to terminate a customers banking account.[10][11]
Luetkemeyer has been married since 1976 to his wife Jackie. They have three children. He has one granddaughter, Riley, and two grandsons, Luke and Evan. Luetkemeyer is a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Eldon Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau, the National Rifle Association, and attends St. Lawrence Catholic Church. [12]"

She is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes most of the western-central part of the state, from Columbia to the eastern Kansas City suburbs. Besides Columbia, it also includes Sedalia, Warrensburg, Marshall, and Lebanon.
Hartzler represented District 124 in the Missouri House of Representatives from 1995 to 2000.[2]


Hartzler was raised on a farm near Archie, a rural community south of Kansas City. She attended the University of Missouri where she graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Education, and attended Central Missouri State University where she graduated with an M.S. in Education.[1]
Before running for State Representative in 1994, Hartzler taught high school home economics for 11 years.[3] Her accomplishments included leadership on legislation facilitating the adoption process. Hartzler left the Missouri State House in 2000 after adopting a baby daughter.
In 2004, after she had left the Missouri General Assembly, Hartzler served as state spokeswoman for the Coalition to Protect Marriage,[4] which supported barring gay people from entering civil marriage contracts. Despite Hartzler's fierce opposition to the Missouri Assembly's ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment[5] (""I don't want women used to pass a liberal agenda""), Republican Governor Matt Blunt nonetheless appointed Hartzler Chair of the Missouri Women's Council in 2005, where she served for two years.[6]
After almost a decade out of politics, Hartzler entered the Republican primary for Missouri's 4th congressional district, held by 17-term Democratic incumbent Ike Skelton. She won a crowded seven-way primary with 40 percent of the vote.
In the November 2 election, Hartzler won with 50.4% of the vote. She is the first Republican to represent this district since 1955, and only the second since the Great Depression. She was also the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri, after Jo Ann Emerson, with whom she served from 2011 to 2013. However, she is the first who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband; Emerson was originally elected to serve out the final term of her late husband, Bill Emerson. However, Republicans had been making gains in the district for some time; it gave John McCain 62 percent of the vote in 2008, and Republicans hold most of the district's seats in the state legislature.
She ran on a conservative platform, voicing support for tax cuts and spending cuts. She is pro-life and opposes gay marriage.
At a town hall meeting in Missouri on April 5, 2012, Hartzler expressed doubts regarding President Barack Obama's birth certificate.[7]
In September 2013, Hartzler voted in favor of a $39 billion reduction in SNAP Benefits (aka ""food stamps""). This bill was separate from farm subsidies for the first time in over three decades, which were increased.[8] Hartzler is a direct recipient of farm subsidies, and has received over $800,000 to date.[9]
On November 18, 2014, during the worst early season cold snap in the U.S. since 1976, Hartzler expressed apparent confusion over the difference between weather and climate and the issue of climate change on Twitter. ""Global warming strikes America! Brrrr!""[10] Her error was rebutted in detail by The Washington Post, which used data to demonstrate that her district in Missouri is an area among the most severely impacted by climate change in the USA.[11]
Hartzler lives on a farm near Harrisonville with her husband Lowell and their daughter."

Cleaver currently represents Missouri's 5th congressional district, where he's served since 2005. He is a member of the Democratic Party, and in January 2010, Cleaver became chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Cleaver previously served on the Kansas City Council from 1979 to 1991, until he was elected Mayor of Kansas City, serving from 1991 to 1999. In 2004, Cleaver was elected to Missouri's 5th congressional district, where his district includes the southern three-fourths of Kansas City, including all of the city south of the Missouri River. It also includes most of the city's suburbs in Jackson County.


Cleaver was born in Waxahachie, Texas, the son of Marie (ne McKnight) and Lucky G. Cleaver.[1] He grew up in public housing in Wichita Falls, Texas. He graduated from Prairie View A&M University where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Cleaver then moved to Kansas City, Missouri where he founded a branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and received a Master of Divinity degree from St. Paul School of Theology.
Cleaver has been the pastor at the St. James United Methodist Church in Kansas City Missouri from March 1972 until June 28, 2009.[2]
Cleaver served as Kansas City Councilman from 1979 to 1991 and as mayor of Kansas City for two terms from 1991 until 1999. He is the first African American mayor of Kansas City. During the last days of his tenure as Mayor, Reverend Cleaver agreed to an international visit to London, England. On the invitation of UK NGO Operation Black Vote he assisted in campaigning for increased electoral participation in the elections for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. His visit culminated in a keynote speech at Westminster City Hall alongside British political figures including Ken Livingstone, Simon Hughes and Lee Jasper. Cleaver is a cousin to exiled KC Black Panther leader Pete O'Neal. In 1997, Cleaver attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a pardon for O'Neal from President Clinton.[3]
After the compromise Budget Control Act deal had been reached to resolve the 2011 United States debt ceiling crisis in August 2011, Cleaver wrote on Twitter calling it a ""sugar-coated Satan sandwich"".[4]
During his tenure, Cleaver has voted with the Democratic party 95.8% of the time.[5] He has been recognized as a Congressman who is ""not shy about earmarks"", and has brought many tax dollars back to Kansas City.[6]
Cleaver has called for ethics charges against Representatives Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters to be dropped, saying ""The process has been tainted.""[7]
On April 6, 2012, the Kansas City Star reported that Bank of America had sued Cleaver Company LLC over a commercial real estate loan for a Grandview car wash. In a lawsuit filed March 30, Bank of America said Cleaver, his wife Dianne, and the company owed over $1.46 million on the loan.[8][9]
On September 11, 2014 around 2:50a.m. what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of Cleaver's Kansas City office. He was in Washington D.C. at the time and no staff members were present during the attack.[10]
In late 2003, Karen McCarthy, who had represented the 5th district since 1995, announced her retirement. Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former Clinton Administration official Jamie Metzl in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, Republican Jeanne Patterson used her own fortune to fund her candidacy and made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri. The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent in 2002.
Cleaver has been reelected twice with some opposition. In 2010, Jacob Turk (Republican) received 45 percent of the vote, with Cleaver receiving 53 percent. In 2012, Cleaver received 60 percent of the vote, with Turk receiving 37 percent. [11]
During the course of the Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton.[12] Cleaver claimed that African American superdelegates who supported Clinton were subjected to harassment, threatened with primary opponents and called Uncle Tom. He said they were told, Youre not black if youre not supporting Barack Obama.  It's ugly.[13] On March 30, 2008, he was interviewed on The Sunday Edition on CBC Radio and said he realized he was on the losing team: ""Even though I don't expect the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Indianapolis Colts, I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs."" [14] According to BlackMissouri.com.,[15] U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois asked Cleaver, If it comes down to the last day and youre the only superdelegate?  Do you want to go down in history as the one to prevent a black from winning the White House?"" I told him Id think about it,"" Cleaver explained. Cleaver said during the course of the primary he'd be shocked if Obama wasn't the next President but made it clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.
Emanuel Cleaver and his wife, Dianne, have four children. They reside in Kansas City.[20]
On June 25, 2000, a road in Kansas City was renamed Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard. The new route consisted of Brush Creek Blvd., E. 47th St., and the portion of Van Brunt Blvd. south of 31st St.[21]"

Graves was born in Tarkio, Missouri, a small city not far from the Iowa and Nebraska borders, and was the son of Janice A. (ne Hord) and Samuel Bruce Graves. He is a lifelong resident of Tarkio.[citation needed] He graduated from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.[citation needed]
Graves was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1992. After only one term, he was elected to the Missouri Senate in 1994.
Following the economic crisis of Wall Street in September 2008, Graves voted against the proposed bailout of United States financial system, claiming that it neither ""punished the wrongdoers nor adequately protected the innocent taxpayers, investors and retirees caught in the Wall Street banking crisis.""[1] In January 2014, Graves introduced the TRICARE Family Improvement Act. The bill would allow dependents of military members to stay on their parents' TRICARE health plan after turning age 26. The bill would change current law, which requires those dependents to change to a separate health plan after turning 26.[2]
Graves is the brother of Todd Graves, former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri.[3] In October 2008, U.S. Senator Kit Bond apologized to Todd Graves after a U.S. Justice Department report cited Bond forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Graves.[4] Following the report, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law (dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy).[5]
In 2009, the House Ethics Committee began inquiring whether or not Graves used his position on the Small Business Committee to invite Brooks Hurst, a longtime friend and a business partner of his wife, to testify at a committee hearing on the federal regulation of biodiesel and ethanol production. Graves had failed to mention the financial link between Hurst and Lesley Graves at the hearing, which dealt with federal subsidies for renewable fuels. A review by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics found ""substantial reason to believe that an appearance of conflict of interest was created.""[6] Graves said in a statement, ""I look forward to a quick review of the facts and answering any questions that the committee may have. I believe that a speedy review will show that all the rules of the House concerning testimony in front of the Small Business Committee were followed.""[7] The Office of Congressional Ethics referred the case to the House Ethics committee, which ended its own investigation in October, and released a report finding no ethical violations, as it asserted there was no standard in place for appearances like Hurst's.[8][9]
In 2000, Democratic U.S. Representative Pat Danner suddenly retired due to breast cancer. Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. Graves faced Representative Danner's son, Steve Danner, a former State Senator, in the general election. Graves referred to Danner as a ""tax and spend liberal"" and won the race with 51% of the vote [10] largely by running up huge margins in the rural areas of the district. He was arguably helped by George W. Bush carrying the district in the 2000 presidential election. Graves easily won reelection in 2002,[11] 2004,[12] and 2006.[13]
Graves faced a tougher reelection race in 2008 against Democratic nominee and former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. He gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting ""San Francisco values."" It was initially considered one of the hottest races in the country. However, Graves won reelection fairly handily, taking 59 percent of the vote to Barnes's 37 percent. Because the district has historically not been considered safe for either party, elections in the district tend to be closely contested.
Graves defeated Democratic nominee Clint Hylton (an Excelsior Springs, Missouri insurance agent who owned a farm in Polo, Missouri) and write-in candidate Kyle Yarber."

Zinke served as a U.S. Navy SEAL from 1985 to 2008, retiring at the rank of Commander. During his career as a SEAL, he served as a member of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group from 1990-1993 and again from 1996-1999.[3] He was awarded two Bronze Stars for combat and four Meritorious Service Medals.[4][5]
He received a BS from the University of Oregon, an MBA from National University, and an MS from the University of San Diego.[6]
Zinke served in the Montana Senate from 2009 to 2011, representing Whitefish, Montana.
He was the running mate of Montana gubernatorial candidate Neil Livingstone in the 2012 election.[7] The Livingstone/Zinke ticket finished fifth out of seven in the Republican primary with 12,038 votes (8.8% of the vote).
In July 2012, Zinke created a super PAC to oppose President Barack Obama's re-election. Zinke stated that the PAC would be a conduit to channel special operations forces frustration with the president, as special operations forces operators are limited in terms of their ability to criticize their civilian commanders.[8] Zinke's involvement with the Super PAC he created before it became a leading supporter of his campaign was criticized by Paul S. Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center, who said that kind of action could lead to ""the campaign-contribution limits being completely eviscerated."" [9]
In spring of 2014, Zinke announced that he was running for Montana's at-large congressional district, held by Republican Steve Daines, who was running for the U.S. Senate.[10] Zinke won the Republican primary with 43,766 votes (33.25%) and faced Democrat John Lewis, a former State Director for U.S. Senator Max Baucus, in the general election.
During a campaign stop Zinke said the United States should focus on the ""real enemy,"" referring to Hillary Clinton as the ""Antichrist.""[11] He later said his comment was ""perhaps a little harsh,"" but ""I had two friends in Benghazi and the truth does matter.""[12]

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Lincoln and includes most of the eastern third of the state outside the immediate Omaha area.


He graduated from Catholic High in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He holds a master's degree in public policy from Georgetown University, a master's degree in theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville, and a bachelor's degree in economics from Louisiana State University.
He has previously worked as an economist, in local economic development, and as a publishing executive for Sandhills Publishing. He was also a policy analyst for the Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations.[1]
Fortenberry was an at-large member of the Lincoln City Council from 1997 to 2001. His main commitments in this role were community revitalization and increasing public safety, but doing both without raising taxation. Among the economic development and community revitalization projects he worked on were the transition of a major public hospital and building a new baseball stadium.[2]
Fortenberry cites his work on the City Council, maintaining a balanced budget while making ""hard decisions about the numbers of firefighters and police officers, funding for parks and recreation, adequate city services, and reasonable taxes and fees to pay for city priorities,"" as an example of fiscal responsibility that citizens should demand from the federal government as well.[3]
Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Doug Bereuter of Nebraska's 1st congressional district decided to retire. Fortenberry decided to run and won the 7-candidate Republican primary with 39% of the vote. He defeated Curt Bromm (33%), the Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, and Club for Growth-endorsed businessman Greg Ruehle (21%).[16][4] In the general election, he defeated State Senator Matt Connealy 54%-43%. He won all but two counties: Thurston and Burt.[5][6]
Fortenberry won re-election to a second term, defeating former Lieutenant Governor Maxine Moul, 58%-42%, winning all but Burt County.[7][8]
He won re-election to a third term, defeating Marine veteran Max Yashirin 70-30%.[9]
He was challenged in the Republican primary for the first time since 2004. He drew two opponents and won with 84% of the vote.[10] He won re-election to a fourth term, defeating legislative staffer Ivy Harper, 71%-29%.[11]
He drew two opponents in the Republican primary again, but won with 86% of the vote.[12]
He won re-election to a sixth term, defeating attorney and Democrat Dennis Crawford.[13]
Fortenberry believes that ""a strong ag economy, small business diversification, and Nebraskans' practical sense regarding responsible lending, finance, and governance have influenced Nebraska's economic success, and has called for leaders in Washington to look to the Heartland as a model of economic revitalization.[14] He voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, otherwise known as the bailout bill, decrying the ""too big to fail"" paradigm and unsustainable taxpayer exposure.
Fortenberry introduced the Renewable Fuels for Americas Future Act of 2010, ""a smart and thoughtful way to reduce subsidies for the production of ethanol"" [15] that would result in taxpayer savings of $5.67 billion, according to economists Ernie Goss of Creighton University and Bruce Babcock of Iowa State University.[16]
Fortenberry supports patient-centered health care reform that lowers costs, improves outcomes, and protects vulnerable persons.[17] He introduced H.R. 321, the SCHIP Plus Act of 2009 to offer eligible families the choice of retaining coverage for their children in the State Children's Health Insurance Program or using SCHIP funds to help pay for a family insurance plan, saving both family and taxpayer dollars.[18] Fortenberry voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care reform bill that was signed into law on March 23, 2010, noting ""This health-care debate is no longer about real health-care reform; its about power. Thoughtful health-care reform could have been achieved with 80-percent support: Health-care reform that drove down costs, improved health-care outcomes, and protected vulnerable persons."".[19]
Fortenberry claims to be ""uncommonly well-informed on international issues,"",[20] and has prioritized foreign affairs work on the Middle East and Africa while in Congress.
Fortenberry co-founded and co-chairs the Congressional Nuclear Security Caucus with U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff. He has been endorsed by Mitt Romney's Free and Strong America PAC.[21]
Fortenberry received a 100% pro-life score from the National Right to Life Committee.[22] He speaks annually at the March for Life.
Fortenberry received an envelope full of glitter on March 4, 2015 from a group protesting the Congressman's pro-life stance. In response, Fortenberry's office reported the mailing to the police, the FBI, and the US postal inspector, an effort described by his own spokeswoman as a ""huge waste of everybodys time and resources"".[23].

He previously served in the Nebraska Legislature.


Smith was born in Scottsbluff, Nebraska and at a young age his family moved to a rural neighborhood south of Gering, Nebraska. After graduating from Gering High School in 1989, Smith attended Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He transferred to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln midway through his second year of college, graduating in 1993.[1] While a student at Nebraska, he interned in the Nebraska Governors Office and, later, served as a legislative page in the Nebraska Unicameral. He returned home to Gering after college, and, in 1994, he began serving as a member of the Gering City Council. Smith continues to live in Gering, Nebraska.
Smith has also worked in the private sector. He has been a realtor as well as a marketing specialist for the housing industry.
In 1998, Smith defeated incumbent State Legislator Joyce Hillman 55%45%.[2] In 2002, he won re-election to a second term unopposed.[3] Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001, he was term-limited.[4]
He sat on the Natural Resources and Building Maintenance committees and was the vice chairperson of the Transportation and Telecommunications committee.[5] Smith served as Vice Chair of the Military and Veterans Affairs Committee and as Chairman of the Four State Legislative Conference in 2001.
Smith ran for the open seat in the 3rd District in the 2006 House elections. Three-term incumbent Tom Osborne gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful run for governor.
Smith won the Republican primary with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates. He faced Democrat Scott Kleeb, a ranch hand and Yale graduate, in the general election.
Approximately one-third of the funding of his campaign came from members of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, limited government, school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the US Department of Agriculture.[6]
For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote. The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences. It covers nearly 65,000 square miles (170,000km2), two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraskas 93 counties (one of which, Cherry County, is larger than the entire state of Connecticut). However, Kleeb raised more money than any other Democrat had raised in the district in decades. Overall, the race was the most expensive in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1963.
As the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House campaign committees. [7] [8]
President George W. Bush also made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smitha sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe Republican seat. [9]
In the end, Smith won by 10 percentage points, taking 55 percent of the vote to Kleeb's 45 percent. [10] This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 16 years; in 1990, Republican Bill Barrett only defeated fellow Unicameral member Sandra Scofield by 4,400 votes. Besides Bush's visit two days before the election, Smith likely rode the coattails of Governor Dave Heineman, who won many of the counties in the district with 80 percent or more of the vote in his bid for a full term.
Smith won the primary with 87% of the vote.[11] He won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Jay Stoddard 77%23%.[12]
Smith won the primary with 88% of the vote.[13] He won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Rebekah Davis 70%18%.[14]

She previously served as U.S. Representative for Nevada's 3rd congressional district from 2009 to 2011, when she was defeated by Joe Heck. In 2012, she ran successfully for Nevada's 1st congressional district. Titus is a member of the Democratic Party. She previously served in the Nevada Senate and was that body's minority leader from 1993 to 2009. Prior to her election to Congress, Titus was an active professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). She taught American and Nevada government at UNLV for 30 years.


Titus was born in Thomasville, Georgia to parents of Greek descent and raised as Greek Orthodox. She grew up in Tifton. Her first exposure to politics came at an early age, when her father, Joe Titus, ran for the Tifton City Council. Her uncle, Theo Titus, served in the Georgia House of Representatives for many years.[1] She attended a summer program at The College of William & Mary and was admitted full-time for the fall - without a high school diploma. There, she studied political science. After earning her bachelor's degree from William and Mary, Titus went on to earn a master's degree from the University of Georgia and a Ph.D. from Florida State University.[1]
After a year teaching at North Texas State University, Titus moved to Nevada and a faculty position in the Political Science Department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Over the past 30 years, her students have included a virtual who's-who list in Nevada government, public service and legal circles, and the popularity of her classes is reflected in the teaching-related awards she has received.[1] She created and continues to coordinate the Legislative Internship Program at UNLV, which each session affords the opportunity for a group of students to work at the Legislature.
First elected in 1988, Titus served for 20 years in the Nevada Senate, representing the Clark 7th District. Her major achievements from the 2007 session included:
Titus authored a bill that requires health insurance companies to cover the costs of the HPV vaccine, Gardasil. Gardasil protects women and girls from 70% of cervical cancers. The bill passed both the Nevada Senate and the Nevada Assembly and was signed by Governor Jim Gibbons.
Titus authored a bill banning ""universal default clauses"" that have enabled some credit card issuers to boost interest rates by 30 percent or more. The bill passed the Nevada Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by Jim Gibbons. Credit Card providers Citibank and Chase rolled back or eliminated universal default clauses due to political pressure in the U.S. Congress.[2]
Titus authored the bill that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators Randolph Townsend and Valerie Wiener. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: ""We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida ... When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a disaster victim to leave behind a beloved pet - a member of their family - is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time.""[3] The bill was signed into law in June 2007.
Titus has sponsored 37 bills, including:[4]
Titus is the author of Bombs in the Backyard: Atomic Testing and American Politics and Battle Born: Federal-State Relations in Nevada During the Twentieth Century. She also has published numerous scholarly articles. She appeared in the 2006 PBS documentary, The American Experience: Las Vegas  an Unconventional History.[citation needed]
Titus received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood's 2014 Congressional Scorecard for opposing a nationwide abortion ban after 20 weeks and supporting abortion access in the District of Columbia and through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[5]
Incumbent Governor Kenny Guinn could not run in 2006 due to term limits. Titus won the Democratic nomination, but lost to Republican Congressman Jim Gibbons. While Titus won Clark County, her margin there was not enough to overcome a landslide margin in Gibbons' 2nd District.
Democrats were heavily targeting 3rd district Republican incumbent Jon Porter. Their top candidate was Clark County prosecutor Robert Daskas, but in April, Daskas dropped out for family reasons. Democrats then quickly recruited Titus, who had won the district in her unsuccessful 2006 run for Governor. Titus defeated Porter in November, 47% to 42%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the District. She was a major beneficiary of the over-all anti-Bush sentiment in the Las Vegas area. She was elected Regional Whip in the 111th Congress.[6]
Titus was defeated by Republican former State Senator Joe Heck by a margin of 2000 votes.
On October 31, 2011; Titus entered the Democratic primary for Nevada's 1st congressional district, where her home had been drawn in redistricting. The incumbent, fellow Democrat Shelley Berkley, gave up the seat to run for the United States Senate. While the 3rd is considered a swing district, the 1st is far and away the safest Democratic seat in Nevada.[7] She initially faced a challenge from State Senator Ruben Kihuen in the Democratic primary. Kihuen dropped out in February 2012, reportedly due to Titus leading him in polls and fundraising.[8] This all but assured Titus' return to Congress after a two-year absence. She easily defeated her Republican challenger, Chris Edwards.
Titus has been married to Prof. Thomas C. Wright for 30 years. Wright's studies in his field of expertise, Latin American history, has taken the couple on extended journeys throughout Central and South American and to Spain. He is a retired professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.[9]
Dina Titus is also a member of the Tortoise Group of Clark County, Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation, PEO International, National League of American Pen Women, Nevada Women's Lobby, Women's Research Institute of Nevada, Nevada Commission on Participatory Democracy, Clark County Neighborhood Justice Center, Las Vegas Little Theater, the Educational Commission of the States, National Wildlife Federation, and the Nature Conservancy. On April 13, 2009, she was named Outstanding Democrat of the Year by the Paradise Democratic Club of Las Vegas for the second time. President Obama sent her a congratulatory letter. In December 2010, Senator Harry Reid appointed her to a six-year term on the United States Commission on Civil Rights.[10]"

On September 13, 2011, Nevada's second Congressional district elected Amodei to replace Congressman Dean Heller. Heller had been appointed to fill John Ensign's seat the U.S. Senate, following Ensign's resignation from the position. Amodei announced his bid for the congressional seat in May 2011. The next month, he won the Republican nomination by taking 221 out of 323 ballots.

Mark Amodei was sworn in on September 15, 2011.[17]
Amodei voted against the bill to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. Regarding the vote, Amodei stated: ""During two campaigns, I told Nevadans I would give my full attention to such issues as reining in runaway federal spending, debt, and the harmful aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many in this town, I will not test your memories and hope you have forgotten. I will continue to pursue these necessary goals. Nothing in this legislation changes the real threats to our countrys economy.""[18]
Amodei received a 0% rating from Planned Parenthood's 2014 Congressional Scorecard for supporting a nationwide abortion ban after 20 weeks and banning abortion access in the District of Columbia and through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[19]

He is identified by National Journal as a moderate.[1]
Guinta worked in the insurance industry before being elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where he served from 2000 to 2004; he also served as a Manchester alderman from 2001 to 2005. He resigned from the State House in 2004 to work as senior policy adviser to Republican Congressman Jeb Bradley. In 2005, he ran for Mayor of Manchester and defeated three-term Democratic incumbent Robert A. Baines. He was re-elected in 2007 but did not run for a third term in 2009. Instead, he ran for Congress in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Carol Shea-Porter. In a rematch in 2012, Shea-Porter defeated Guinta to reclaim her seat. Guinta defeated Shea-Porter for a second time in 2014.[2]


Guinta, the son of Richard and Virginia Guinta, was born in Edison, New Jersey in 1970. He graduated from the Canterbury School, a Catholic boarding school in New Milford, Connecticut, and Assumption College, a four-year liberal arts college in Worcester, Massachusetts (where he met his wife, Morgan).
After their marriage, the couple moved to Boston, where Guinta worked for Travelers Insurance and other entities in the insurance industry. He also began his own insurance consulting firm. He then attended Franklin Pierce Law Center in New Hampshire, where he earned a Masters Degree in Intellectual Property.[3]
Former Rep. Guinta is also notable as having been the owner/operator of the ""Inn of the Weary Traveller"" chatroom on the now-defunct WebChat Broadcasting System network, one of the internet's first role-playing chats. [4]
On November 7, 2000, Guinta was elected to a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Manchester. He was re-elected on November 5, 2002.
In 2001, Guinta ran for the post of alderman from Manchester's Ward 3. In the non-partisan municipal primary election held on 1 September 2001,[5] Guinta and George Skilioganis were the two top vote-getters in Ward 3, with 375 and 279 votes, respectively, securing them a place on the November ballot. On 6 November 2001, Guinta defeated Skilioganis by a vote of 630 to 522 in the general election.[6]
Two years later incumbent alderman Guinta and the challenger Glenn R.J. Ouellette, a runner-up in the 2001 primary, faced no opposition in the primary. In the 3 November 2003 general election, Guinta beat Ouellete 452 to 324.[7] While serving as alderman, Guinta was one of the few Republicans on the 14-member Board of Alderman. The mayor of Manchester during Guinta's tenure on the board, Robert A. Baines, also was a Democrat.
In 2004, he resigned his House seat to take a position as senior policy adviser to U.S. Congressman Jeb Bradley,[8] who preceded Carol Shea-Porter as the U.S. Representative for New Hampshire's First District. Guinta held the post until March, 2005, when he resigned to campaign for mayor of Manchester.[3] Guinta was taking on Mayor Baines, a three-term mayor who had won two-thirds of the vote in the 2003 general election, who was seeking a fourth term.
In the non-partisan primary held on 5 September 2005, Guinta placed second in a three-candidate field, garnering 3,760 votes to Baines' 5,168. (Jeff Kassel received 651 votes.)[9] On 8 November 2005, Guinta defeated Baines in the general election by 528 votes (10,125 to 9,597),[10] becoming Manchester's youngest mayor in over 100 years. He ran on a platform of improving education, increasing public safety and security, revitalizing Manchesters neighborhoods, promoting fiscal responsibility, and reducing property tax rates. He was inaugurated on January 3, 2006.[11]
During Guinta's first term as mayor, the city raised the complement of Manchester's police force by 22 officers to 225[12] and added a police substation on Manchester's west side.[13] Guinta also tackled violence at local nightclubs. In 2006, at the urging of Guinta, neighbors, and other city officials concerned about violent crime, the state Liquor Commission refused to renew the liquor licenses for clubs Omega, Envy and Fish, resulting in their closure.[14] Guinta emphasized community policing and cooperation between law enforcement and the community. With regards to taxes and spending, Guinta takes credit for Manchester's first tax cut in a decade.[15]
Guinta was elected to a second term as mayor on November 6, 2007, defeating Democrat Thomas Donovan, a former school board member.[16] Guinta received the backing of the New Hampshire Union Leader during his re-election bid. The paper's editorial board praised Guinta as ""a tax-cutting crime fighter...[who] has pushed bureaucratic reform and improved services.""[17]
In June 2009, Mayor Guinta announced his plan to lower property taxes by reducing school funding by 7 million dollars.[18] Guinta explained his budget by telling WMUR-TV, ""We've got to find ways to be more effective, more efficient so we can keep money in taxpayers' and property owners' pockets.""[19]
Guinta did not run for re-election in 2009. In the election to determine his successor, Republican Alderman and State Senator Ted Gatsas defeated Democratic alderman Mark Roy.
Guinta's Democratic opponent, incumbent Carol Shea-Porter, had represented New Hampshire's 1st congressional district for two terms. The race received national attention because some analysts had rated it as one of the best chances for a Republican pick-up in New England in 2010.[20]
In April 2009, Guinta announced that he would run for higher office rather than for a third term as mayor.[21] In May 2009, he filed papers and announced his candidacy for the House.[22] On September 14, 2010, he won the Republican primary election.[23]
In October 2010, the New Hampshire Democratic Party filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Clerk of the House concerning $355,000 Guinta loaned to his own campaign from a bank account that had not been disclosed in any previous financial statements, including those filed during his time as mayor of Manchester.[24][25] The issue was first raised by Guinta's fellow Republicans during the Republican primary.[26] Guinta dismissed speculation that the money represented an illegal campaign donation, stating that the money came from his own earnings and savings but refusing to make public the related bank statements.[27][28] On December 15, 2011, the general counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct informed Guinta that the committee reviewed his candidate financial disclosure reports and subsequent amendments thereto, and have determined that they are in substantial compliance with federal ethics law.[29][30]
On November 2, 2010, Guinta defeated incumbent Shea-Porter by a margin of 54%-42%.[31]
Guinta won the 2012 primary election handily, obtaining 84.3% of the vote against Republican challengers Rick Parent and Vern Clough.[32] Shea-Porter was nominated again by the Democrats to retake the seat, and Brendan Kelly ran on the Libertarian Party ticket. Guinta was defeated by Shea-Porter by a margin of 46%-50%.
Guinta campaigned to win back the seat he lost in 2012. He formed a joint fundraising committee with Massachusetts Republican and congressional candidate Richard Tisei.[33]
He won the election on November 4, 2014 with 52% of the vote, reclaiming his former seat from Carol Shea-Porter.
Guinta has worked to place a full-service VA medical facility in New Hampshire and has emphasized veterans' homelessness within the district.[34]
Guinta says he would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though he supports the provisions of the law that protect people with pre-existing conditions and that allow people to stay on their parents health plans until age 26. Guinta identified mental health funding and reform as a priority for New Hampshire.[35]
Guinta has described the deficit and debt as ""a spending problem, not a revenue problem."" He has faulted both parties for their role in unsustainable spending, and advocates that spending be cut and made ""more effective and efficient"".[36] Guinta supports providing tax incentives for small businesses,[37] lowering taxes, and reducing government spending. He has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, a pledge never to increase taxes or revenue.[38] Guinta supports ""broad-based"" tax reforms that ""lower taxes for all Americans"", and simplifications to ensure that average Americans can fill out their own tax forms. He supports reforms to automatic spending programs.[39] Guinta has opposed the automatic cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the ""sequester"") that affect defense spending, out of concern for employment at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.[40]
Guinta organized multiple job fairs in New Hampshire. One such fair, on November 10, 2011 at Manchester Community College, was oriented toward unemployed veterans; it assembled representatives from 40 employers to discuss employment opportunities, and representatives from one dozen organizations to explain services available to veterans.[41]
On energy, Guinta has favored an ""all-of-the-above"" energy approach encompassing both fossil fuels and alternative energy sources.[42] Guinta has favored authorization of the Keystone XL Pipeline to expand oil access, help control the price of oil, and create jobs.[43]
On July 22, 2012, CREDO activists, joined by Occupy movement members, staged a protest at Manchester's Northeast Delta Dental Stadium, where Guinta was holding a fund-raiser.[44]
Guinta describes himself as pro-life.[45] While in Congress, Guinta voted for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.[46]
Guinta says Social Security reform is needed in order to make the program solvent. He has said that said both parties need to negotiate without any preconceived notions.[35]"

An attorney, lobbyist, and nonprofit consultant from Hopkinton, New Hampshire, Kuster is a member of the Democratic Party. She was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 6, 2012.[1]


Kuster was born in Concord in 1956. Both of her parents were politicians. Her father Malcolm McLane was Mayor of Concord, a member of the New Hampshire Executive Council, and an owner of Wildcat Mountain Ski Area. In 1972, he ran for Governor of New Hampshire as an independent. He got 20 percent of the vote, allowing Republican Mel Thomson to win the election with a plurality of 40 percent of the vote.[2] In the 1976 presidential election, he endorsed Republican Gerald Ford. In the 1980 presidential election, he endorsed Republican turned independent John B. Anderson.[3] Her mother, Susan McLane, was elected to the New Hampshire Senate as a Republican.[4] In 1980, she ran for New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district, but got second place in the crowded Republican primary with 25 percent. Judd Gregg won with 34 percent of the vote, whilst Charles Bass (whom Kuster defeated in 2012) came third with 22%.[5] Kuster's great grandfather, John McLane, was Governor of New Hampshire from 19051907. He was elected as a Republican in 1904 with 58 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Henry Hollis.[6]
Kuster graduated from Dartmouth College in 1978 with a degree in Environmental Policy and from Georgetown University Law Center in 1984.[7]
After college, Kuster became the director of Rath, Young and Pignatelli's education and nonprofit law practice group.
Kuster was a consultant and owner of Newfound Strategies LLC, ""a consulting and training practice that works with nonprofit clients to maximize their effectiveness and sustainability through fundraising, outreach and strategic planning.""[7]
She has worked previously as an ""of-counsel"" partner in the Concord law firm of Rath, Young and Pignatelli. Kuster's legal practice at Rath, Young and Pignatelli focused on education, nonprofit and health care policy.[4] Kuster has also worked as an adoption attorney, having been involved in more than 300 adoptions since 1984. She is a member of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys.[8]
Kuster has served as chair and board member of the Capitol Center for the Arts and as a founder and vice chair of the Women's Fund of New Hampshire. She has also served on the boards of the N.H. Charitable Foundation, New Hampshire Public Radio, Child and Family Services of NH, the Alumni Council and Tucker Foundation at Dartmouth College, and Womankind Counseling Center.[8]
From 1989 to 2009, Kuster worked as a lobbyist in the state of New Hampshire, earning more than $1.3 million in fees from various businesses and non-profits. $460,000 of that money came from ambulatory surgical centers, $150,000 from investment companies, and $145,000 from pharmaceutical manufacturers and their association. In an editorial, the Union Leader stated, shes also a career lobbyist, not in dreaded Washington, but in Concord. But shes refused to use that word. Rather, Kuster referred to herself as a ""public policy advocate.[9][10]
Kuster's career has also involved many years of lobbying on behalf of clients such as Merck Vaccines; Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) -- with whom she helped created the NH Medication Bridge program, a public-private partnership which provides free prescriptions to patients in need; Fidelity Investments - with whom she helped create the NH UNIQUE College Savings Plan to help families save money for college tax-free; Dartmouth College and Medical School; NARAL Pro-Choice New Hampshire; Bedford Ambulatory Surgical Center; and the New Hampshire College and University Council.[4][9]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Kuster took $192,553 in contributions from lawyers and lobbyists during the 2010 election cycle.[11]
In 1998, while working on behalf of Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., a pharmaceutical manufacturer, Kuster lobbied against HB 1553. The bill would have reclassified three drugs, including Rohypnol, linked to date rapes, assaults, robberies, and driving offenses, as Schedule 1 Controlled Substances, making them illegal to possess. The University of New Hampshire Sexual Harassment and Rape Prevention Programs coordinator called the rescheduling of Rohypnol an imperative, as the drug poses an imminent and serious threat to public health and safety. [12]
Kuster served on the New Hampshire steering committees of the presidential campaigns for Barack Obama in 2007-8 and John Kerry in 2003-4. Kuster also served as Co-Chair with Peggo Hodes (the wife of Congressman Paul Hodes) of New Hampshire Women for Obama. Kuster was a 2008 delegate for Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention in Denver and a member of the 2004 New Hampshire Delegation in Boston. In 2000, Kuster received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for dedicated service to the Democratic Party at the local, state and national levels.
According to the Concord Monitor, ""For 20 years before her campaign announcement, she worked the halls of the New Hampshire State House as a lobbyist representing a range of clients. Kuster's government-relations work accounted for perhaps half of the comprehensive legal services she offered, in addition to her practice arranging private adoptions.""[9] Kuster's longtime lobbying clients included Dartmouth Medical School, which receives monies from the State of New Hampshire to reserve places in Dartmouth Medical School for students from New Hampshire.[9] Working on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Kuster's most prominent project was helping to create the NH Medication Bridge program [13] which provides free prescription medication to low-income patients earning under or near the poverty level. Kuster also fought proposed legislation that would prohibit drug makers from offering discounted drugs unless the discounts were offered to every buyer; the bill failed in subcommittee to strong bipartisan opposition. Kuster earned an average of $65,000 annually from 1989 to 2009 for this activity, according to reports she filed with the State of New Hampshire.[9]
Kuster's long involvement in lobbying was a source of controversy during the Democratic primary for New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district.[9][14] and her opponent in the general election, Congressman Charles Bass, also worked for the lobbying arm of a law firm Devine Millimet between his terms in Congress.[15]
At a town hall meeting located at the New Hampshire Jewish Federation in Manchester, N.H. in November 2013, Kuster fielded questions relating to the Middle East. After reading a written question regarding establishing a select committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Kuster indicated that the questions ""should stay focused on the Middle East."" Audience members contended that Libya is located in the ""Middle East"". The video quickly went viral across the Internet, gaining more than 260,000 views in less than 48 hours.[16][17]
Kuster supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).[18][19]
In 2010 Kuster ran for New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district against Republican nominee Charles Bass, Libertarian nominee Howard Wilson, and Independent candidate Tim vanBlommesteyn. It was an open seat as Democratic incumbent Paul Hodes was running for the U.S. Senate.
Kuster was defeated by Bass 48%-47%, a difference of just 3,550 votes.[20]
Kuster ran for New Hampshire's Second District against Representative Charles Bass again in the 2012 general election. She received the endorsement of Democracy for America, and was selected as one of their Dean Dozen.
On November 6, 2012, Kuster defeated Bass 50%-45%.[1][21] In doing so, she became a part of the nation's first all-female congressional delegation. This delegation includes current Senior Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Junior Senator Kelly Ayotte, and Representative Carol Shea-Porter.[1]
Kuster ran for re-election in 2014, defeating Republican opponent and State Representative Marilinda Garcia.[22] Kuster was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Frontline Program, designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election.[23] The primary election took place on September 9, 2014, with the general election held on November 4, 2014. Republicans who ran in Kuster's district included State Representative Garcia and former State Senator Gary Lambert.[24] Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton and his super PAC spent $30,000 on a two-week television ad buy opposing Kuster and her response to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.[25]
Representative Kuster has sponsored 11 bills of her own, including:[26]
Kuster is married to Brad Kuster, a fellow lawyer. They have two sons.
Kuster and her mother, State Senator Susan McLane, coauthored a book titled The Last Dance: Facing Alzheimer's with Love and Laughter.[27] After her mother's death, Kuster and her father, Malcolm McLane, toured New Hampshire speaking publicly about aging and Alzheimer's disease and the burdens on families and caregivers that result.
In February 2013, WMUR-TV reported that Kuster had been late paying property taxes on a home in Hopkinton starting in 2010 and had failed to pay two tax bills for a property in Jackson in 2012. Following the report, Kuster stated that the bills were being paid.[28] Kuster, whose assets have been estimated at $1.8 million, was reported to have been late on taxes six separate times since 2010, totaling $40,000 in back taxes. Kuster ultimately paid the taxes. When asked why she was consistently late, Kuster stated, Life is expensive.[29][30]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is at the southern end of New Jersey, and is the largest congressional district in the state. It includes all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and parts of Camden, Gloucester, Burlington, and Ocean Counties.


Born in Bridgeton, New Jersey, LoBiondo attended Georgetown Preparatory School, and received a B.A. in Business Administration from Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He worked for twenty-six years in a family-owned trucking company.
LoBiondo served on the Cumberland County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, he was elected to NJ's 1st Legislative district in the lower chamber of the New Jersey General Assembly and served from 1988 to 1994. He won re-election in 1989, 1991, and 1993.
In 1992, LoBiondo ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat William Hughes by a wide margin. When Hughes declined to run for re-election in 1994, LoBiondo ran again and was elected to the House. He was a member of the Republican ""freshman class"" elected in the 1994 midterm election and was part of Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract with America. Since then, he has won every re-election bid with at least 59% of the vote even though he represents a district that is marginally Democratic on paper. In 2012, his district gave President Barack Obama 54% of the vote.
LoBiondo is running for re-election to the U.S. House in 2014. He won the Republican nomination in the primary election on June 3, 2014. He will face Democrat William J. Hughes in the general election.
He has been endorsed by Gov. Chris Christie, the Laborers International Union of North America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the New Jersey State Building & Construction Trades Council, and the New Jersey State Fraternal Order of Police.[1][2][3][4]
LoBiondo is a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.[5] His record on several issues, particularly the environment, fits a moderate Republican. In 2005, National Journal ranked him as the most liberal Republican representative in New Jersey and more liberal than most of New York's Republican congressional representatives.[6] Americans for Democratic Action in 2005 placed him in a higher liberal quotient than most of the Republican representatives in those two states.[7] In 2011, LoBiondo appeared in an It Gets Better Project video, part of a YouTube campaign reaching out to young gay teens who have been bullied.[8]
On March 4, 2011, Andrew J. McCrosson Jr., who served as treasurer of LoBiondo's congressional campaign committee from 1995 until August 2010, pleaded guilty in federal district court to charges of embezzling more than $458,000 from campaign accounts over a fifteen year period. The charges included one count of wire fraud and one count of and converting funds contributed to a federal candidate. LoBiondos campaign attorney called this ""an abuse of the trust placed in him by the campaign.""[9] McCrosson was sentenced 30 months in prison.[10]
On November 21, 2013, LoBiondo introduced Bill H.R. 3578; 113th Congress into the House.[11] The bill would require that ""any federal rules on testing of air traffic controllers for sleep disorders are issued under a formal rulemaking process.""[12]
In 2012, LoBiondo, along with Democratic congressman Frank Pallone, introduced legislation allowing states to legalize sports betting, then only allowed in four states, arguing it would strengthen Atlantic City as a venue for tourists dollars.[13]"

MacArthur grew up in Hebron, Connecticut. He received his bachelor's degree from Hofstra University.[1] MacArthur worked in the insurance industry. He was chairman and chief executive officer of York Risk Services Group for 11 years. He served on the Randolph, New Jersey Township Council from 2011 through 2013, including a tenure as mayor in 2013.[1]
When Jon Runyan, a Republican who represented New Jersey's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, announced that he would not run for reelection in 2014, MacArthur chose to run for the Republican Party nomination. MacArthur resigned from the Randolph council to move into the congressional district.[2] He ran against Steve Lonegan in the Republican Party's primary election, and defeated him.[3] He faced Aimee Belgard of the Democratic Party in the general election.
MacArthur defeated Belgard by an 11-point margin, winning the popular vote in both Ocean and Burlington Counties.[4][5]

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Trenton and includes large portions of central New Jersey. He is currently the dean of the New Jersey congressional delegation.


Smith grew up in the Iselin neighborhood of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, worked in his family's sporting goods business, and earned the Eagle Scout award. After graduating with a B.A. from Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey) in 1975, became executive director of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee in 1976. Originally a Democrat, he switched parties and became a Republican in 1978.[1]
In 1978, while working at his family's sporting goods store, 25-year-old Smith ran for Congress as a Republican. He was defeated by longtime Democratic incumbent U.S. Congressman Frank Thompson 61%-37%.[2][3] In 1980, he ran again for a rematch. Initially, Smith was thought to have little chance against Thompson, but Thompson was indicted as part of the FBI's Abscam probe.[1] Helped by Ronald Reagan's strong performance in the district, Smith defeated Thompson 57%-41%.[4]
In 1982, Smith faced a difficult race for re-election. He faced Democrat and former New Jersey Senate President Joseph P. Merlino. At the end of one of their debates, Smith approached Merlino to exchange pleasantries. Merlino was quoted as saying ""Beat it, kid."" Smith won the election with 53% of the vote.[5][6] Since then, Smith has won re-election with at least 61% of the vote.[7]
Even in a political climate hostile to Republicans across the nation in 2006, Smith won re-election with 66% of the vote, the highest percentage for any Republican in the New Jersey delegation.[8]
Smith faced a challenge from Democrat Joshua M. Zeitz in 2008, who raised far more money than any of Smith's previous opponents. Despite the very difficult political climate for Republicans, Smith won re-election 66%-32%. McCain won the district by a narrower margin as the 4th CD was one of only three he won in the state.[9]
Smith's voting record is one of a social conservative and a fiscal moderate. In 2011, American Conservative Union gave Smith a lifetime score of 60%.[10]
Smith is active in several health care issues, serving as co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force, Coalition for Autism Research and Education, and Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus.
In September 2001, the anthrax letters sent to New York and Washington, D.C. passed through the post office sorting facility in Hamilton Township, just east of Trenton. The facility was closed and some 800,000 pieces of mail delayed. Smith introduced a bill to waive financial penalties for people whose mail was delayed;[11] the banking industry agreed to waive the fees voluntarily.
Smith has worked to raise New Jersey's Medicare reimbursement rates to New York City levels. He voted to postpone the 2005 base closing round by two years. For over ten years he has worked to bring in $50 million for the Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. The station, which designs and builds aircraft carrier catapults and arresting gear, was slated to remain open when the Pentagon released its base closing recommendations in May 2005, though it was to lose 186 jobs.
Smith is one of the strongest opponents of abortion in either house of Congress .[citation needed] Smith has worked to stop abortions in military hospitals.[12] He has also worked to reinstate the Ronald Reagan-era restrictions that would deny federal funds to family planning organizations that distribute information about abortions abroad.[13] The ensuing struggle lasted more than two years, with Smith leveraging his opposition to the family planning money to prevent passage of the Clinton administration's high-priority efforts to reorganize the State Department, pay U.S. dues to the United Nations, and provide $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund .[citation needed] Smith finally was forced to yield in the 1998 and 1999 omnibus spending bills, but he won in return White House agreement to restrict support for international abortion education. George W. Bush restored the Mexico City Policy in an executive order in his first full day in office, but it has since been repealed by President Barack Obama.[14]
Smith also was a prime mover of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions; the House voted to override Clinton's vetoes, but Smith's side fell a few votes short of the two-thirds needed in the Senate. In a January 22, 2004, press release, Smith stated, ""Americans want the abortion holocaust to end."" and referred to abortion as ""child slaughter"".[15]
Smith has fought not only Democrats but the House Republican leadership on the abortion issue. In July 2002 the bankruptcy bill, strongly backed by the leadership, came out of conference committee; the House had passed it 306108 in March 2001 .[citation needed] But it contained a provision, negotiated by Senator Charles Schumer and longtime abortion opponent Henry Hyde, providing that court judgments or fines could not be wiped out in bankruptcy: Schumer inserted this as a favor to abortion rights groups, after some abortion protesters declared bankruptcy to avoid paying fines .[citation needed] Smith and Joe Pitts led a group of abortion opponents and said they would vote against the bill unless the provision was removed .[citation needed] In November, the leadership brought forward the rule to vote on the bill and Speaker Dennis Hastert took the unusual step of voting for it himself (the Speaker usually does not vote).[citation needed]
Smith and Pitts stood their ground despite furious efforts by Whip Tom DeLay, and the rule went down 243172, with 87 Republicans voting against .[citation needed] It was only the second rule defeated during Hastert's first four years as speaker, and Hastert called Smith into his office to scold him in January 2003. Smith won a legislative victory in 2004 when a provision stating that state and local governments could not require hospitals and care providers to perform abortions was put in the omnibus appropriation. He continues to push for his legislation, The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, which requires doctors to inform pregnant women that some experts say fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks.
Smith serves as Co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.
He spoke at the annual March for Life rally in Washington, DC, on January 22, 2009, and 2010. [12]
Smith has expressed support for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.[16]
In 2011, he introduced HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.[17] The bill contained an exception for ""forcible rape,"" which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape.[18][19][20][21][22] The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest, but not other forms of statutory rape, regardless of the age of the victim.[17] This position has been dropped, however, and Chapter 4 Section 309 of HR 3 has been changed to rape and incest of any type due to an amendment by the Committee of the Judiciary in their report to the House.
In 2013, Smith introduced into the 113th Congress a similar but more expanded bill, H.R. 7, also titled the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which, beyond its title prohibition, disallows as a medical income tax deduction any personal funds used for an abortion or expenses paid out of tax-exempt ""cafeteria"" health plans, or personally-funded Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) or health savings accounts (HSAs). The bill also excludes from the definition of a qualified health plan any insurance coverage that includes abortions, rendering such plans ineligible for a tax credit to individuals or employers.[23] The bill was co-sponsored by 151 Republicans and three Democrats.[24] Supporters claim that H.R. 7 is necessary because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act.[25] Critics of the bill claim it will ""incentivize business owners to drop private insurance coverage for abortion, increase taxes on some women who choose to have an abortion, and empower the IRS to conduct audits of rape survivors.""[26]
His belief in a ""right to life"" has also led Smith to oppose both capital punishment and embryonic stem cell research. On the issue of stem cell research, Smith has actively worked to increase research into non-embryonic stem cells. Smith's ""Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005"", which provides $265 million for stem cell therapy, umbilical cord blood and bone marrow treatment was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2005.
In July 2006, Smith voted to uphold President Bush's veto of legislation that promoted embryonic stem cell research[27] and called for increased investment for cord blood and bone marrow stem cell research.[28]
In 2003, Smith co-sponsored an amendment to renew the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.[29] He was endorsed by the Brady Campaign in 2006[30] and 2008.[31] In 2008, the Brady Campaign endorsed five Republicans for Congress (The others were Chris Shays, Michael Castle, Mark Kirk, and Peter T. King).[32]
In 2005, Smith was appointed chairman of the House International Relations Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations Subcommittee. Smith also is vice-chairman of the Committee on International Relations and as of 2011 became Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as the United States Helsinki Commission), which works to promote and foster democracy, human rights, and stability in Eastern and Central Europe.
Since being elected to Congress, Smith has also played a key role over the years promoting human rights reforms in the former Soviet Union, Romania, Vietnam, China, Sudan, Cuba, and elsewhere. He wrote the provision of the law that barred the Royal Ulster Constabulary (as the Police Service of Northern Ireland was formerly known) from training in the United States with U.S. law enforcement personnel until it was certified that the police met stringent human rights standards. That certification was issued in December 2001 by President George W. Bush.
One of Smiths significant legislative achievements is his landmark Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Law, the nations' first law that deals specifically with human trafficking. This law provided government prosecutors with the resources needed to prosecute offenders as well as resources to help victims rebuild their lives.
Smith began investigating and working to end the human trafficking epidemic in the mid-1990s. Trafficking is a $9 billion industry, the third largest source of income for organized crime and the second fastest growing criminal activity in the world, equal with illegal arms sales.
In 2003, a second Smith trafficking lawthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Acttook effect and further strengthened his original law. Smiths original trafficking law also reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, the most significant law to help protect women who are victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Like the trafficking component, the VAWA reauthorization works to ensure prosecution of offenders and help the victims recover.
In January 2006, President George W. Bush signed Smiths third trafficking lawthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005, which strengthens the nations current trafficking law (which he also authored in 2000), authorizes new funds for investigation and prosecution of domestic trafficking within the United States and to helps the young women and children who are most often the victims of human trafficking operations.
Smith has strongly criticized China for its forced sterilizations and abortions and its persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, and opposed normal trade relations with China. In July 2003, after a provision for $50 million for the United Nations Population Fund passed by one vote in committee, he led the fight against it and it was defeated on the floor 216211.
Smith has condemned Russia for barring entry of foreign Roman Catholic priests and the Saudis for treating foreign servants as slaves. In 2000 he had the signal success of pushing to passage a bill combating sex trafficking around the world, including a provision opposed by the Clinton administration requiring yearly reports on each nation's record; Clinton signed it anyway. In 2003, he worked to extend it to 2005. Smith has also taken action on the subjectwhen he heard about Ukrainian girls being held against their will in brothels in Montenegro, he called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.[33]
Smith has also been a strong supporter of issues of importance to Armenian Americans including U.S. recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[34]
In 2003 he successfully sponsored a law providing $81 million for centers in the U.S. and abroad to counsel victims of torture. In July 2004 the House passed 32345 his bill to bar increased aid to Vietnam unless the administration finds substantial progress toward releasing political prisoners and fostering religious freedom and democratic government.
Smith's moral views have led him to take stands unusual for a Republican on domestic issues. In July 2003 he cast a critical vote in committee for Henry Waxman's resolution of approval for future global climate change agreements. In October 2004, he voted against James Sensenbrenner's amendment broadening the category of illegal immigrants subject to immediate deportation.
Smith was a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; during the Goldman child abduction case,[35] traveling with him to Brazil, advocating for him in Congress and writing H.R. 2702 to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit,[36] as well as H.R. 3240 the ""International Child Abduction Prevention Act of 2009""[37] He has subsequently spoken several times on international child abduction generally and on International child abduction in Japan specifically.
In May 2012, while holed up in the United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng telephoned Smith to seek his advice. Smith suggested that Chen seek to depart China and continue to push for human rights in China from outside the country.[38] After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.[39] Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements and ask questions to those present in the Committee room.[40]
In February 2013, Smith voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. The extension nonetheless passed in the House of Representatives by a large margin.[41]
Smith does not support gay marriage or LGBTQ protections. In February 2015, Smith stated, ""I am a strong believer in traditional marriage and do not construe homosexual rights as human rights."" This comment drew rebuke from a number of people, including U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr.[42][43][44]
Since 2006, Smith has introduced versions of the Global Online Freedom Act to Congress, which is intended to prevent repressive governments from using Internet and information technologies purchased from US companies against their citizens. The most recent version, re-introduced on May 6, 2009,[45] drew bipartisan support from Speaker Nancy Pelosi,[46] as well as the endorsements of Amnesty International,[47] Google,[48] Human Rights Watch,[49] Reporters without Borders,[50] Freedom House,[51] and other human rights and journalist organizations.[52]
In January 2001, Smith became chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and there pushed for policies opposed by the Republican leadership, including voting against the Republican and for the Democratic budget resolution because the latter included more spending on veterans programs, which resulted in his losing the chairmanship in January 2005, two years short of the normal six-year term.[53] In his four years, Smith's committee passed veterans bills that increased Veterans Affairs disability payments by $2.5 billion, increased G.I. Bill of Rights spending 46%, authorized $1 billion in aid to homeless veterans, and added $100 million in health care benefits for surviving spouses of veterans. Smith's 2004 bill increased from 18 to 24 months the coverage of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act, set up a pilot program for recruitment of nurses, and authorized a new research center of veterans with multi-trauma combat injuries.
Veterans Laws Authored by Smith include one providing a record 46 percent increase in the GI Bill, which helps veterans pay for college. The increase is the largest ever since the GI Bill went into effect following World War II.
Smith also wrote the nation's first law that addresses and combats the plague of chronic homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act authorizes $1 billion in programs to help veterans find and retain jobs and provides them with housing, counseling, and medical care they need to rebuild their lives.
For three years, the Appropriations Committee explicitly forbade spending on Smith's four research centers to develop responses to chemical, biological and radiological attacks. In early 2003, Smith called for making veterans benefits an entitlementmandatory spending that would not have to go through Appropriations. GOP leadership opposed and there were threats he'd lose the chair. In 2003, he voted for the Republican budget resolution that included a $1.8 billion increase in veterans spending, but in July 2003, appropriators did not include the money; Smith opposed that but disappointed Democrats by not voting against the vote sending the measure to the floor.
Smith did not expect a challenge for the chair when Congress convened in 2005. But Steve Buyer, the fourth ranking Republican on the committee, asked for an interview with the Republican Steering Committee, and on January 5, 2005, it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the Republican Conference on January 6Smith was off the committee altogether. He was obviously disappointed. ""I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans,"" he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage.
On May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress), which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a sex offender of children is going to be traveling to their country.[54][55][56]
On May 9, 2014, Smith introduced the bill Autism CARES Act of 2014, a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to autism spectrum disorders (autism) conducted by various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).[57] Smith argued that ""this is a critical investment that is working to determine the cause of ASD, identify autistic children as early as possible to begin treatment, and producing better awareness, new therapies and effective services. The quality of life of many children is at stake, as it is with young adults who age out of the support services in educational systems.""[58]

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes much of the northern-most and western-most portions of the state. He previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1992 to 2003.


Garrett earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Montclair State University in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Rutgers School of Law - Camden in 1984.[1]
He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1992 to 2003 representing the 24th legislative district, which covered all of Sussex County and several municipalities in Morris and Hunterdon counties.
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress), a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.[2] The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[2] The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[2] The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.[3] These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.[4]
Although Garrett promoted himself as a ""mainstream tax-cutter that President Bush needs in Congress,""[5] he broke with the Bush Administration several times.
He also serves on the Liberty Caucus (despite opposing the legalization of online poker), a group of libertarian-minded congressmen.[6] Other members include(ed) Ron Paul of Texas, Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, and Jeff Flake of Arizona.[7]
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen US lawmakers to introduce a bill in the House of Representatives backing UN membership for Taiwan, contrary to U.S. policy since Nixon.[8] Garrett is a staunch supporter of military aid to Israel as well as sanctions against Iran.
Garrett is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[9]
In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined ""unlawful Internet gambling""). He was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for oil and gas drilling off the shore of New Jersey.[10] Garrett was also the only member to vote against restrictions on ""price gouging"" by oil companies,[11] to vote against child safety locks on handguns, and to vote against emergency funding for Hurricane Katrina victims.[12] He was the only New Jersey member to vote against federal aid for household pets in case of a disaster.[13] He was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to vote against an extension of unemployment benefits.[14]
Garrett was the only member of the New Jersey delegation that voted to keep the government closed during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.[15] He was also the only member of the New Jersey congressional delegation to refuse to sign a letter urging the House to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy. He was one of 11 Congressmen to vote against providing aid for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[16]
As a state legislator, he once proposed public schools teach intelligent design alongside evolution.[17]
In July 2007, Congressman Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native Alaskan and Hawaiian educational programs.[18] Congressman Don Young of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, ""You want my money, my money.""[18] Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending earmarks[disambiguation needed], and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.[18] While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the Republican Study Committee gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.[18]
Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act for purposes of states' rights.[19]
Garrett led a drive to demand the immediate resignation of Governor Jim McGreevey after he admitted to an extramarital affair with a male state employee. McGreevey announced that he would stay in office until November 15, 2004. Had McGreevey resigned before September 8, 2004, there would have been a special election at the same time as that year's presidential election. Garrett started a petition on his campaign web site demanding a special election. According to his campaign manager, it received 10,000 responses.
In November 2009, Garrett met at the United States Capitol with protesting ""tea party"" constituents. After birthers harangued him for several minutes, he agreed President Barack Obama should produce an original birth certificate to verify his eligibility to be President of the United States.[20][21]
Garrett is considered the most conservative member of the New Jersey delegation, and one of the most conservative congressmen ever to represent the state. He has a lifetime ACU rating of 99.6, none of New Jersey's other congressmen have ratings higher than 69.[22] Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave Garrett a grade of C- (2006) and B (2007-08). Disabled American Veterans gave Garrett grades of 0% (2005, 2004), 50% (2003), and 100% (2006).[23] The Veterans of Foreign Wars endorsed him in 2006.[24] In his 2012 reelection bid, Garrett carried the support of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum political action committee.[25]
Garrett ran for Congress unsuccessfully against incumbent Congresswoman Marge Roukema in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, falling short both times with 48% of the vote.[26] He received support from several groups who had long felt chagrin at Roukema's moderate voting record; Garrett had by this time established himself as one of the most conservative members of the General Assembly.
In 2002, Roukema opted not to run for a 12th term. Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 45% of the vote over State Assemblyman David C. Russo (26%) and State Senator Gerald Cardinale (25%), who had received Roukema's endorsement.[27][28]
In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced Democratic candidate Anne Sumers, an ophthalmologist and former Republican. Roukema did not endorse Garrett in the general election. Roukema did not endorse Sumers either, even though part of Sumers' strategy was to portray herself as a ""Roukema Republican"" and win support in Roukema's old Bergen County base (Bergen County is the biggest county in the 5th district). Sumers' chances decreased significantly after she made several ill-advised comments about the U.S.-Taliban conflict on an Internet message board.[29] The race essentially ended at that point, and Garrett won in a rout, 60% to 38% - even winning Roukema's former base in Bergen County.[30][31]
Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. He declined to debate his opponent Anne Wolfe, several times, claiming to have conflicts with his schedule in Washington D.C. Eventually he debated her twice. In 2006, Garrett defeated his Republican primary rival, Michael J. Cino of Bergen County. In the November 2006 election, Garrett defeated Paul Aronsohn, a former employee of the U.S. State Department during the Clinton Administration and Independent R. Matthew Fretz to win a third term. However, in this election, he only won 55% of the votethe lowest percentage for a Republican in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1983. The 2006 election was close enough to attract the attention of the DCCC, who targeted the 5th District for a pickup in 2008. The Democratic Party nominated Dennis Shulman, a highly respected rabbi and psychologist, as their nominee in 2008. Garrett defeated Shulman 56%-42% in the 2008 general election.[citation needed]
In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote.
In 2014, Garrett faced Democratic nominee Roy Cho. Garrett won the midterm election.[32]
Garrett is a member of Lafayette Federated Church in Lafayette Township, New Jersey."

The district, numbered as the 3rd District from 1988 to 1993, is located in the north-central part of the state and includes New Brunswick, Perth Amboy, Sayreville, Piscataway and Asbury Park. He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Pallone is a graduate of Middlebury College, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and Rutgers School of LawCamden. Prior to being elected to the House, Pallone was a member of the Long Branch city council from 1982 to 1988.
He was a member of the New Jersey Senate (the upper house of the New Jersey Legislature), from the 11th district, from 1984 to 1988. In 1983, he defeated incumbent Republican State Senator Brian T. Kennedy 50%-49%.[1] In 1987, he won re-election with 60% of the vote, defeating Councilwoman Gerri C. Popkin of Neptune City.[2]
In March 1988, 23-year incumbent U.S. Congressman James Howard (D-Spring Lake Heights) of New Jersey's 3rd congressional district died. In November, Pallone defeated Republican State Representative Joe Azzolina 52%-47% and Libertarian Laura Stewart. In 1990, he won re-election with 49% of the vote, against a Republican, an independent, Libertarian Bill Stewart, and a Populist.
After redistricting, Pallone's district was renumbered as the 6th District. In the Democratic primary of 1992, he defeated State Representative Robert Smith 55%-37%. In the general election, he defeated Republican State Senator Joe Kyrillos 52%-45% and nine other candidates. Since then, he has won re-election with at least 60% in all but two elections (1998 and 2010). In 1998, he defeated Republican teacher Mike Ferguson 57%-40%.
Pallone was challenged by Republican nominee Anna C. Little. Little is a former Monmouth County Freeholder and served as Mayor of Highlands, New Jersey in addition to working full-time as an attorney specializing in immigration law. On November 3, 2010, Pallone defeated Little by over 16,000 votes, 55% to 43% in what analysts considered a terrible year for Democrats. However, for the first time in his career, Pallone failed to carry his home county of Monmouth.
Pallone is a Progressive Caucus Member. He serves as Vice Chairman of the Native American Caucus, where he has worked on a bipartisan basis to protect the inherent sovereignty of tribal governments and promote the needs of Indian Country. As a senior member of the House Resources Committee  the committee with jurisdiction over all matters regarding the relations of the United States with American Indians and Alaska Natives  he has been a defender of the sovereign status of Indian Tribal governments as independent from the United States.
He also serves as a co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues along with Congressman Ed Royce (previously Joe Knollenberg and Mark Kirk) and was instrumental in garnering the support of 127 members (30%) of the U.S. House of Representatives for the Armenian Caucus.[3] In 2002 he was awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal by the President of the Republic of Armenia.[4]
In 2002, he was awarded India's third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan for his contributions as member of the India Caucus in the Congress.[5]
He was one of the 31 who voted in the House to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election.[6]
Pallone received an A on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[7] while the National Taxpayers Union has consistently given Pallone an F ranking on votes that affect taxes, spending, and debt.[8]
Pallone has questioned the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its update of flood plain maps in Monmouth County, specifically in the Bayshore area.[9]
Pallone has introduced a bill to modify the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the U.S.'s most important set of fisheries regulations.;[10][11]
On October 3, 2008 Rep. Pallone voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program[12] believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to ""purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector.""
After U.S. Rep. Chris Smith stated he does ""not construe homosexual rights as human rights"", Pallone issued a statement supporting homosexual rights. The statement read, in part, ""Representatives in Congress must be promoting the expansion of human rights, not fighting to limit its definition to people that they deem to be appropriate.""[13][14]
Pallone opposed the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (H.R. 2019; 113th Congress), which passed in both the House and the Senate. The bill would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[15][16] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[16][15] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[17] Pallone said the bill was ""a disingenuous and empty attempt by the Republicans to divert attention from the fact that they have voted to cut research time and time again.""[18] Democratic opponents blamed Republicans for $1.5 billion cuts to the National Institutes of Health and said this money would not make it up.[18] Supporters of the bill argued back that the use of this money for pediatric cancer research was a better than using it for political campaigns, so the bill should be supported for that reason.[18]
In 2002, Pallone turned down an offer to replace embattled Sen. Bob Torricelli as the Democratic nominee for US Senate by Democratic Party leaders. The slot eventually went to Sen. Frank Lautenberg who ended up winning the general election. In 2004-2005, Pallone considered a gubernatorial bid against embattled and unpopular Gov. Jim McGreevey but ended up supporting eventual party nominee winner, then-Senator Jon Corzine.
Early in 2005, Pallone announced his intentions to seek the United States Senate position held at the time by Jon Corzine. Corzine won the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey in June 2005, and Pallone was the first New Jersey politician to officially seek Corzine's Senate seat. Pallone launched ""Pallone for New Jersey"" to inform New Jersey citizens of his work in the House and his desire to be New Jersey's next Senator. In January 2006, Pallone announced his endorsement of Bob Menendez for Senate in the November 2006 election, ending his bid for the seat.
Pallone was an early and strong endorser of Sen. Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic Party primaries. Pallone traveled to New Hampshire to campaign for Clinton. Clinton eventually lost the primary to Sen. Barack Obama who went on to become President. Pallone also endorsed Frank Lautenberg over Congressman Rob Andrews.
On January 3, 2013, it was revealed that Pallone is considering another bid for the Senate should Senator Frank Lautenberg elect not to pursue another term in office in 2014.[19] On June 9, 2013, Pallone said he is officially in the race to fill Lautenberg's senate seat, due to the Senator's death, and can win the Democratic primary against Newark Mayor Cory Booker by running on his progressive congressional record.[20] The family of the late Senator Frank Lautenberg endorsed Pallone on July 8, 2013.[21] The state council of sheet metal workers also endorsed Pallone.[22]
In the August 13, 2013 primary election, Pallone lost to Newark mayor Cory Booker. [23] Booker then won the general election.
Pallone lives with his wife Sarah Hospodor-Pallone who works as Deputy Associate Administrator of Intergovernmental Relations at the EPA in Washington, DC [24] and their three children who reside with them in Washington, DC. He married Hospodor-Pallone in August 1992."

Lance (born June 25, 1952) is the U.S. Representative for New Jersey's 7th congressional district, serving since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the New Jersey Senate and the New Jersey General Assembly.


Leonard Lance was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, into a political family. His parents were Anne M. (ne Anderson) and Wesley Leonard Lance, who was a State Senator.[4][5] His great-uncle, H. Kiefer Lance, was also active in New Jersey politics.
After attending North Hunterdon High School in Annandale, New Jersey, Lance received a B.A. from Lehigh University in 1974, a J.D. from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1977 and an M.P.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1982.[6]
Leonard Lance served as the law clerk to the Warren County Court in 1977 and 1978. He was assistant counsel for county and municipal matters to Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean from 1983 to 1990. He was a member of the New Jersey Council on the Humanities during the Whitman Administration by appointment of the Governor.
Lance served in the New Jersey General Assembly for 11 years (19912002) and served in the New Jersey Senate for 7 years (2002-2009). In 2002 he was elected to the New Jersey Senate and held the position of Minority Leader from 2004 to 2008.[6]
In 1987, he first ran for the General Assembly. He lost the Republican primary, ranking third with 17% in New Jersey's 23rd District.[7] Lance was appointed to the New Jersey General Assembly in February 1991 when then-Assemblyman William E. Schluter was appointed to the New Jersey Senate upon the ascension of Dick Zimmer from the New Jersey Senate to the United States House of Representatives in January 1991. After redistricting, Lance ran for the newly redrawn 23rd District in 1991, and won the Republican primary. In the general election, he ranked second with 30%, winning a seat. Incumbent Republican State Assemblyman Chuck Haytaian ranked first in the district with 33%.[8] In 1993, Lance won re-election to a second term with 40%.[9] In 1995, he won re-election to a third term with 34%.[10] In 1997, he won re-election to a fourth term with 30%.[11] In 1999, he won re-election to a fifth term with 36%.[2]
After redistricting, he ran for the New Jersey Senate in 2001 in the 23rd District. He defeated Democrat Frederick P. Cook 69%-31%.[12] In 2003, he won re-election to a second term with 68%.[13] In 2007, he won re-election to a third term with 67%.[1]
In the general assembly, he served as the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee from 2000 to 2002 and the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, when it handled the state budget, from 1996 to 2000. While Appropriations Committee Chairman, the committee oversaw state finances, taxation and spending on individual legislation, while budget issues were passed to a separate Budget Committee.
He served on the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, the Legislative Services Commission and the Budget and Appropriations Committee.[6] As Republican Budget Officer, he served as the Ranking Minority Member of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, along with serving as the Republican Senate Caucus' chief point person on budget and finance issues and in budget negotiations.
Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Zimmer of New Jersey's 12th congressional district decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Lance decided to run and lost, ranking third with 26% of the vote. He carried two of the district's five counties: Mercer and Hunterdon. Michael Pappas a former Mayor of Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ won the Republican primary with 38%.[14]
On June 3, 2008, Lance won the Republican primary to replace retiring U.S. Congressman Mike Ferguson in the New Jersey's 7th congressional district with 40% of the vote, defeating six opponents: Kate Whitman, the daughter of former Governor Christine Todd Whitman, former Summit Common Council President P. Kelly Hatfield, Scotch Plains Mayor Martin Marks, veteran Tom Roughneen, activist Darren Young, and professor A.D. Amir.[15] The primary left his campaign's funds depleted, leading him to hold several fundraisers, including one with President George W. Bush. Touring his district, he ran on a platform of fiscal conservatism, moderate social values, and environmentalism. He vowed to be ""an independent voice"" in Congress if elected.
His Democratic opponent was Linda Stender, a New Jersey Assemblywoman who unsuccessfully challenged Republican incumbent Ferguson in 2006. During the campaign, Lance took strong positions against the Alternative Minimum Tax, the estate tax, Governor Jon Corzine's controversial toll hike plan, and the partisan nature of the United States Congress. He came under fire from Stender's campaign for his 2006 vote in the New Jersey Senate against a bill which prevented pharmacists from refusing to dispense medication such as birth control pills due to religious concerns. Lance was one of only a few Senators to vote against the bill. However, both Lance and Stender are pro-choice. Lance was firmly opposed to negotiations with Iran on the presidential level, saying that he only favors holding such talks on a ministerial level. He also made energy independence one of his signature issues, along with fiscal accountability and debt reduction. On foreign policy, both candidates supported withdrawal from Iraq, a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and increased attention to the genocide in Darfur. Lance and Stender debated each other twice during the campaign. In September, they met in Scotch Plains for a debate hosted at the Jewish Community Campus of Central New Jersey. It was moderated by Westfield Rabbi Douglas Sagal. The candidates met in October in Edison for a second debate, which was televised on News 12 New Jersey and moderated by Walt Kane. On October 21, The Star-Ledger editorial board endorsed Lance in the 2008 election. On October 25, The New York Times followed suit. Eight other newspapers also endorsed Lance over Stender.
On Election Day, November 4, 2008, Lance defeated Linda Stender 50%-42%.[16][17]
On June 8, 2010, Lance defeated three other candidates in the 7th District Republican primary, two of whom claimed to be tea party activists. He received 56% of the vote with the rest of the vote split among: businessman David Larsen (31%), IT consultant Lon Hosford (8%), and real estate appraiser Bruce Baker (5%).[18][19]
Lance defeated the Democratic nominee, science teacher Ed Potosnak, in the November general election 59%-41%.[20]
Redistricting made Lance's district significantly more Republican than its predecessor.[21][22] The new map pushed the 7th to the north, absorbing several heavily Republican areas that had previously been in the strongly Republican 5th and 11th districts while losing some Democratic-leaning areas.
In the 2012 Republican primary, Lance was again challenged by Larsen, who identifies himself with the Tea Party movement although he is not formally a member.[23] On June 5, 2012, Lance again won the Republican primary, this time 61%-39%.[24] Lance defeated the Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Upendra J. Chivukula, 57%-40%.
Lance voted against continued funding to Planned Parenthood, a national women's reproductive health care provider that also performs abortions.[citation needed] He also joined his party in opposing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, and 2009 ""war supplemental"",[citation needed] while breaking with it in voting for the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. During President Bush's tenure and while he was still in the state senate, Lance openly voiced support for the Iraq War.
In June 2009 Lance was one of only eight Republicans in the House of Representatives to break with their party and vote for the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Lance had campaigned as a strong advocate for environmental protection and reduction of American dependence on foreign oil. In supporting the bill, Lance cited the bill's economic benefits for New Jersey, the fact that it would not enlarge the national debt, estimates by the Energy Information Administration and Congressional Budget Office suggesting that costs to consumers would be minimal, and its goal of reducing American dependence on foreign oil.[25]
In 2011, Lance left the House Financial Services Committee and was appointed to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Lance voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,[26] and has been at the forefront of action to encourage the Supreme Court to review the legislation. Lance is a member of the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership.
Lance is a co-chairman of the House Republican Israel Caucus. The caucus focuses on the relationship between the United States and Israel. It is one of the largest organizations of Members of Congress, in terms of membership numbers.[27] Lance has served as a co-chairman since at least 2011.[28] Additionally, Lance is a member the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus. The caucus is sponsored by the Israel Allies Foundation, a group that promotes communication between legislative members in different countries and supports the right of Israel to exist in peace.[29][30]
Lance also serves as the Republican chairman of the Rare Disease Caucus. The goal of the caucus is to get Members of Congress to support passing bills that help people who suffer from rare diseases.[31] Seventy-six Members of Congress are caucus members.[32]
In 2013, Lance introduced the Modernizing Our Drug and Diagnostic Evaluation and Regulatory Network Cures (MODDERN) Act, a bill intended to encourage new innovative treatments for a variety of diseases and ailments. The MODDERN Drug Act proposes to reevaluate and reintroduce drugs that were once in the development phase, back into production and testing. Backers of the bill hope this will lead to new treatments that were once thought too costly to research and test. This bill would benefit patients suffering from a variety of ailments including but not limited to: ALS, Parkinson's, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and Alzheimer's.[33]
Lance married his wife, Heidi A. Rohrbach, who is a VP at JPMorgan Chase, in August 1996. They have a son, named Peter Frank. .[34] He is a former trustee of the Newark Museum, of Centenary College in Hackettstown and of McCarter Theatre in Princeton."

The district, numbered as the 13th district from 2006 to 2013, includes most of northern and eastern Jersey City, as well as most of the Latino neighborhoods of Newark. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He previously represented district 33 in the New Jersey General Assembly from 2000 to 2006.[1]


Albio Sires was born January 26, 1951 in Bejucal, Cuba. He immigrated to the United States with his family at age 11 with the help of relatives in the United States.[2] He eventually settled in West New York, New Jersey; he still lives there today. He attended Public School 4, where he and his brother were two of only three Latinos in the school. Sires learned English from a teacher who used flash cards and phonetics.[3] and subsequently attended Memorial High School, where he was a star basketball player, whose skills on the court helped him obtain a basketball scholarship to Saint Peter's College. He received a B.A. in 1974 in Spanish and Marketing. He received an M.A. in 1985 from Middlebury College in Spanish.[1][3]
Sires worked at Memorial High School as a teacher and coach. He also became a successful businessman,[3] and is the owner of the A.M. Title Agency Inc.[4][5]
Sires was the first Hispanic mayor of the town of West New York and in 2004 he was elected mayor of the year by his fellow mayors.[3]
Sires served as the Speaker of the Assembly from 2002 to 2006 and was the first Hispanic person to serve as New Jersey's Assembly Speaker. He was considered a surprise pick for speaker, since he had only served one term in the Assembly before taking the position. It has been reported that he was elected as speaker after Gov.-Elect Jim McGreevey decided he did not want then Assembly Minority Leader Joseph Doria, a former speaker, to serve as speaker during his governorship.[6]
Sires was an active Democrat in the 1970s and 1980s. He switched to the Republican Party in 1985 and he ran for Congress in 1986 against Frank Guarini. Sires lost that election by a 71% to 26% margin. Sires left the Republican Party in 1994 and became a registered independent. Sires rejoined the Democratic Party in 1998. Just three years later, he became Speaker.[4]
During his tenure as speaker, Sires served as Acting Governor of New Jersey on several occasions, when former Gov. Jim McGreevey and former Gov. Richard Codey left the state. He was the first Hispanic person to serve as an Acting Governor of New Jersey. As Acting Governor, Sires signed several bills into law and performed routine duties of the office.
For the 20062008 legislative session, Sires was given the largely honorary title of Speaker Emeritus. Sires is a former Chairman of the Legislative Services Commission. Sires stepped down from his seat in the Assembly, and was replaced by Silverio Vega, who was selected by the Democratic district committee to replace Sires. Vega was sworn into office on December 11, 2006.[7]
Sires was the Mayor of West New York, New Jersey from 1995 to 2006. Sires was succeeded by Vega, who will retain his mayoral seat while he simultaneously serves in the Assembly, joining three fellow Hudson County mayors  Brian Stack of Union City in the Assembly and both Nicholas Sacco of North Bergen and Joseph Doria of Bayonne in the New Jersey Senate  who serve as both mayors and in the New Jersey Legislature. For many years, it was common for New Jersey mayors to serve in the legislature as well, though this practice has been abolished.
Albio Sires has voted with the Democratic Party 93% of the time since joining Congress.[8]
Sires is a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus.[9]
Sires is seen as a ""champion of mass transit."" He supports federal funding for public transportation projects. He believes that these will ultimately help his constituents.[10]
He was an advocate for a $9 billion ""federal, state and locally-funded public transit tunnel from New Jersey to New York that broke ground in June 2009."" The project is expected to employ thousands of people.[10]
In March 2012, Sires also pushed for a two year bill that would help by funding highways and mass transit.[11][12] He also pushed to extend the current surface transportation bill so the House and Senate can reconcile the differences between the House bill and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).[12]
Sires has made affordable housing one of his priorities. Residents of his district pay more for housing - including rent and home prices - than most places in the country. He has supported legislation focused on making housing more affordable.[10]
In 2006, 13-year incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez moved up to the United States Senate to fill the seat vacated by Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine. Sires then entered the race to succeed him. He ran in two Democratic primary elections on June 6, 2006--a special primary for the last two months of Menendez' seventh term, and a regular primary for a full two-year term.
In the special primary to fill the remaining two months, Sires won approximately 90% of the vote, defeating James Geron. This all but assured Sires of being the next congressman from this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district. In the regular primary, Sires beat Assemblyman and Perth Amboy Mayor Joseph Vas in a bitter primary. Sires defeated Vas 68% to 32% and won in Union, Hudson and Essex Counties, while Vas bested Sires in Middlesex County. No Republican even filed, assuring Sires of a full term. However, the 13th is so heavily Democratic that any Republican who opted to file would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event.
Sires faced Republican John Guarini  a salesman and second cousin of former Congressman Frank J. Guarini (197993)  who was unopposed for the GOP nomination. Vas did not seek the unexpired term seat. After winning the election with 78% of the vote, Sires was sworn into the House on November 13, 2006 to begin to fill the remaining term of Senator Bob Menendez.[13]
CQPolitics noted ""Sires likely November victories would cap off his ambitions for a House seat, which he first expressed exactly 20 years ago under very different circumstances. He ran that year as the Republican challenger to entrenched incumbent Guarini, but managed only 27 percent of the vote.""[14]
Sires is part of a handful of Cuban lawmakers serving in the House, though until Florida's Joe Garcia was seated in 2013 he was the only Democrat.

The New York Times rated the 13th District as ""solid Democratic"" in 2010.[15] Sires was challenged by Republican nominee Henrietta Dwyer; he would defeat her with 74% of the vote.[16]
After New Jersey lost a district in the 2010 census, Sires ran for reelection in the 8th District, essentially a reconfigured version of the old 13th. In the primary election, he faced 25 year old candidate Michael J. Shurin, whose campaign largely focused on the legalization of marijuana.[17]
On October 4, 2013 Sires' home town of West New York, New Jersey honored him by renaming its Public School No. 4 the Albio Sires Elementary School. The school, which is located at 6300 Palisade Avenue, is the elementary school that Sires himself attended as a child. In attendance at the October 4 ceremony were West New York Mayor Felix Roque and U.S. Senator Robert Menendez.[3]
Sires and his wife, Adrienne, live in West New York.[18]"

In May 1990, Pascrell was one of four candidates in Paterson's mayoral election with the winner to take the office that Frank Graves, who had served since 1982, had vacated upon his death two months before the election. Pascrell won with 51% of the vote in the nonpartisan election[9] and was re-elected in 1994 with 46% of the vote against his eventual successor Martin Barnes, a Republican from the Third Ward, and former Mayor Thomas C. Rooney, Jr., a Democrat from the Sixth Ward.[10]
Pascrell served as mayor of Paterson while he also served as an assemblyman. For years this was a common practice for New Jersey officeholders, but new laws have rescinded the practice.[citation needed]
In 1996, Pascrell ran for New Jersey's 8th congressional district and defeated Republican incumbent Bill Martini 51%-48%, a margin of 6,249 votes. Pascrell was likely helped by Bill Clinton's easy victory in New Jersey in that year's presidential election.[11] After that, he never won re-election with less than 62% of the vote.
After redistricting, Pascrell's home was placed in the newly redrawn New Jersey's 9th congressional district. Fellow Democrat U.S. Congressman Steve Rothman decided to move into the 9th and challenge Pascrell in the primary. Rothman was placed in a Republican-leaning district against Republican Scott Garrett.[12] Rothman represented 53% of the new 9th, while 43% of the new 9th district is from Pascrell's old 8th CD.[13]
Pascrell defeated Rothman in the Democratic primary on June 5, 31,435 to 19,947, capturing approximately 61.1% of the vote.[14] In the general election, he defeated Rabbi Shmuley Boteach by 73.6% to 25.4%.[15]
Rothman's candidacy in the 2012 primary race reportedly devolved into a highly competitive proxy war over Israel, between the states pro-Israel community and a growing constituency of Arab voters who have accused a sitting congressman of putting Israels interests before Americas. Aref Assaf, president of the New Jersey-based American Arab Forum, published a column in the Newark Star Ledger titled, Rothman is Israels Man in District 9 in which he wrote:
As total and blind support becomes the only reason for choosing Rothman, voters who do not view the elections in this prism will need to take notice. Loyalty to a foreign flag is not loyalty to Americas [flag].[16]
Arabic-language campaign posters produced by Pascrell supporters reportedly encouraged the Arab diaspora community to elect Pascrell, the friend of the Arabs. The poster touted the race as the most important election in the history of the [Arab American] community.[16][17][18]
Susan Rosenbluth, publisher of the New Jersey-based Jewish Voice and Opinion wrote that ""a number of Arab-American constituents have come out with outrageous attacks on Rothman,"" and commented that ""I havent heard a dual loyalty charge for years. She also sharply criticized Pascrell for remaining silent and refusing to condemn the charges of dual loyalty.[18][19][20][21]
Pascrell is the first New Jerseyan to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means in 10 years.
On October 10, 2002, Pascrell was among the 81 Democratic House members who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.[22]
Pascrell was one of the original members of the Homeland Security Committee, eventually rising to the post of ranking member on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee. He has a particular interest in fire safety, and authored the bill that created the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which gives federal grants directly to all fire departments, including volunteer fire departments, which he calls ""the forgotten part of the public safety equation"".
He was also a member of the House Transportation Committee, where he worked to modernize roads, bridges, airports and mass transit systems. He has secured funding for reconstructing various dangerous roads and bridges throughout New Jersey, including bringing attention to the Route 46 corridor. In addition, he has helped craft legislation to renew federal surface transportation programs, providing funding toward New Jersey Transit. The new legislation tackled projects of rail expansion between Passaic and Bergen counties, bridge construction throughout Route 46, and the establishment of a bike-pedestrian path in South Orange.
Pascrell is an Italian American and has been outspoken about the representation of Italian-Americans in the media regarding what he sees as negative stereotypes in shows such as HBO's The Sopranos. His Italian heritage was questioned by comedian Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, who alleged in an interview that Pascrell could not truly be of Italian descent because Italian surnames must end with a vowel. Pressed by Colbert for an example of an Italian surname ending in a consonant, Pascrell responded with ""Sole"".[23]
During Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, Pascrell asked for investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice into the practices of Ticketmaster and TicketsNow in regard to sales of tickets to the tour's New Jersey shows.[24] Pascrell subsequently introduced proposed federal legislation, titled the ""BOSS ACT"" (Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing), which would require primary ticket sellers to disclose how many tickets were being held back from sale, prohibit ticket brokers from buying tickets during the first 48 hours on sale, and prohibit primary ticket sellers, promoters, and artists from entering the secondary market.[25] In 2012, problems again arose during the first ticket sales for Springsteen's 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times its highest level for the year. Shows were selling out within minutes and many tickets at much higher prices appeared on resale websites such as StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Pascrell again responded saying he would reintroduce the BOSS ACT bill to Congress.[26][27]
After the death of a young boy in his district who returned to playing football without having fully recovered from a concussion sustained earlier in the season in October 2008, Pascrell introduced the Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act (the ConTACT Act), which has received the endorsements of the National Football League, the National Football League Players Association, and the Brain Injury Association of America. The legislation brings together a conference of experts to produce a consensus set of guidelines for the treatment and care of concussions for middle and high school students. It also provides funding for schools' adoption of baseline and post-injury neuropsychological testing technologies.[28]
In January 2011, Congressman Pascrell responded to the Tucson shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords by stating, ""[t]here's an aura of hate and elected politicians feed it, certain people on Fox News feed it.""[29]
On March 12, 2013, Pascrell introduced the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1098; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects to reduce the incidence of traumatic brain injury and projects related to track and monitor traumatic brain injuries.[30] He is the Co-founder and Co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, which was founded in 2001 and now includes more than a hundred members of Congress.[31]"

Payne, a member of the Democratic Party, served as president of the Newark, New Jersey city council from 2010 to 2012.[2]
Following the death of his father, U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne, in March 2012, Payne ran to succeed his father in Congress. He won the Democratic primary election on June 5, 2012, which is tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district,[3] and won the general election on November 6, 2012. In addition, he won a special election to fill the seat for the remainder of his father's term.[4]


Payne was born and raised with his two sisters Wanda and Nicole in Newark, New Jersey.[5] His father Donald M. Payne, served in the United States House of Representatives from 1989 until his death in 2012; he was the first African-American to represent the state of New Jersey in Congress.[6] His mother Hazel Payne (ne Johnson), died in 1963 when Payne was 5 years old.[7] As a teenager, Payne was the founder and first President of the Newark South Ward Junior Democrats. He went on to study graphic arts at Kean University. He was an adviser at the YMCA Youth in Government Program.
He worked for the New Jersey Highway Authority from 1991 until he joined the Essex County Educational Services Commission in 1996, where he worked as the Supervisor of Student Transportation.[8]
In 2010, he won re-election to the Municipal Council of Newark with 19% of the vote. Other candidates elected were Mildred C. Crump, Luis Quintana, and Carlos Gonzales.[9]
As a City Councilman, he has supported Planned Parenthood, Stem cell research, medicaid and education funding.[10]
In July 2010, he was elected President of the Newark City Council, succeeding Mildred C. Crump.[11]
Payne's committee assignments include Health, Education and Recreation.[8]
In 2005, he was one of four candidates elected to the At-Large seat. He ranked first with 19% of the vote.[12] In 2008, he won re-election to a second term with 20% of the vote.[13] In 2011, he won re-election to a third term with 18% of the vote.[14]
After his father's death, Payne declared his intention to run in two elections in 2012: the special election to fill the remainder of his father's unexpired term, and the regularly scheduled election for the two-year term beginning in January 2013. The primaries for both elections were held on June 5, 2012, and the general elections will be held on November 6, 2012.
According to documents filed on May 24, 2012 with the Federal Election Commission, Payne both raised and spent more money than any of the other Democratic candidates.[16] Payne was endorsed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on May 22, 2012.[17]
In the Democratic primary for the special election, Payne competed against Ronald C. Rice (son of State Senator Ronald Rice) and Irvington Mayor Wayne Smith. He won the special election primary, receiving 71 percent of the vote, compared to 25 percent for Rice and 5 percent for Smith.[18]
In the Democratic primary for the full term, Payne competed against Rice, Smith, State Senator Nia Gill, Cathy Wright of Newark, and Dennis R. Flynn of Glen Ridge.[19] He won in a landslide, garnering 60 percent of the vote. Rice received 19 percent, Gill 17 percent, and Smith, Wright and Flynn, combined for about 5 percent of the vote.[20]
After the election, he said, ""I've said that I'm following a legacy and I'm not backing away from that.""[21] In the general election held on November 6, 2012, he defeated Republican candidate Brian C. Kelemen with 87% of the vote.[22] He ran unopposed for the special election to fill the remainder of his father's term. However, the 10th is a heavily Democratic, black-majority district, and Payne had effectively assured himself of succeeding his father with his primary victory.
Payne was sworn into office of November 15, 2012.[23] Payne was a cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 and the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill aimed at expanding the scope of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Fair Labor Standards Act.[24][25] Payne was also a cosponsored H.R. 41, authorizing $30.4 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Flood Insurance Program to victims of Hurricane Sandy.[26]
On March 24, 2014, Payne introduced the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act (H.R. 4289; 113th Congress) a bill that would require the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), within 120 days of the bills enactment, to devise a strategy to improve communications among DHS agencies.[27][28] DHS would be required to submit regular reports to Congress on their progress and the decisions they make.[28]
Payne lives with his wife Bea and his triplets in Newark."
"252","","1995","1946","New Jersey 11","Hobart College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Frelinghuysen","Rodney Frelinghuysen","Republican","New Jersey General Assembly","Episcopalian","Rodney Procter Frelinghuysen (/frilhasn/; born April 29, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for New Jersey's 11th congressional district, serving since 1995. The district includes most of Morris County, an affluent suburban county west of New York City. It also includes some of the wealthier areas near Newark and Paterson, and is one of the richest congressional districts in the nation in terms of median income. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Frelinghuysen was born in New York City to Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen II, a New Jersey politician and Beatrice Sterling Procter, an heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune. He attended St. Mark's School, an exclusive Episcopal preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts.[3] Rejected from Princeton,[4] the alma mater of his father and grandfather, Frelinghuysen instead matriculated at Hobart College in New York. There he served as president of the Kappa Alpha Society and earned a BA in American history in 1969.[5] Frelinghuysen next enrolled in a graduate program at Trinity College but was soon drafted into the United States Army. Following basic training at Fort Dix, he was assigned as a clerk to the commanding officer of the 93rd Engineer Battalion, which was primarily responsible for building roads and water supply systems in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.[5][6]
After his military service, Frelinghuysen was hired by then-Morris County Freeholder Director Dean A. Gallo to be the county's state and federal aid coordinator and administrative assistant.[7] He held this position until 1974, when he was elected to serve as a Morris County Freeholder. He served three terms as a member of the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders, and was chosen to be its director in 1980.[8]
In 1983, Frelinghuysen was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 25th legislative district. Frelinghuysen served in the Assembly until 1994. He was Chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee during the 1988-89 legislative session.[8]
In 1990 he ran in the Republican primary for New Jersey's 12th congressional district against Dick Zimmer and Phil McConkey. During the race the Frelinghuysen campaign ""broke ground in high-tech politicking"" when it sent voters a seven-minute video cassette of Frelinghuysen. The video, which contained photographs of Frelinghuysen in Vietnam and praise from former Gov. Tom Kean, served as a preemptive tactic against opponents' attempts to characterize the blue blooded Frelinghuysen as ""an irrelevant debutante"".[9] Frelinghuysen finished in third place.
In late August 1994, U.S. Congressman Dean Gallo, the six-term Republican incumbent of New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District, announced his intention to withdraw from the upcoming election for medical reasons (he had recently been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and died two days before the election). As Gallo had already defeated three opponents in a hard-fought primary the previous June, his withdrawal triggered a convention of Republican committee members from the district's municipalities. Frelinghuysen, who had been Gallo's former employee and fellow Morris County freeholder and state assemblyman, sought the committee's nomination at Gallo's request, and was chosen to be the Republican nominee for the district.[10]
Frelinghuysen went on to defeat Democratic State Senator Frank Herbert 71% to 28% in the November 1994 election.[11] However, the 11th is one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast, and Frelinghuysen had effectively clinched a seat in congress by winning the Republican nomination. He has been reelected nine times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 59% of the vote.
He has only been challenged in the Republican primary twice; once in 2008 and again in 2010. In 2008, he defeated Kate Erber in the June primary 87% to 13%.[12] In 2010, he defeated Richard Luzzi 76% to 24%.[13]
In 2000, liberal activist Michael Moore attempted to have a ficus challenge Frelinghuysen's unopposed re-election in order to make the point that most Members of Congress ""run unopposed in their primaries and 95% are re-elected every time in the general election"", adding ""we think it's time to point out to the Frelinghuysen family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty.""[14] (Since 1793, New Jersey has sent six Frelinghuysens to Congress  four to the U.S. Senate and two to the House of Representatives.)
Rodney Frelinghuysen's campaigns have been heavily supported by contributions from the aerospace and defense industrial sector;[15] seven of his 2012 campaign's top ten donors came from this sector,[16] and he received more defense funding in the last electoral cycle than any other representative from New Jersey.[17] His campaigns have also been heavily supported by contributions from pharmaceutical and health care industries.[15][18] Eight of the 14 bills sponsored by Mr. Frelinghuysen in the last congressional session (112th) were attempts to suspend duties on chemicals used by these industries.[19]
Like most other Republicans from New Jersey, Frelinghuysen's voting record has been relatively moderate. He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. Some have claimed, however, that his moderate record is a thing of the past.[23][24][25] During his 2012 election, when charged with claims that he had aligned himself with the staunchly conservative Tea Party movement and ""toes the line of Republican leadership"", he insisted that he is still a moderate.[24]
From the start of his tenure in the 104th Congress to the current 113th, Frelinghuysen has voted with his party 90% of the time.[26]
Abortion
Frelinghuysen's record on abortion was once considered moderate; he is a member of Republican Majority For Choice and Republicans for Choice. In 2003 he received a 50% from the anti-abortion rights NRLC and a 30% from the pro-abortion rights NARAL.[27] In recent years, however, Frelinghuysen's stance has shifted; from 2010 to 2012, his NARAL rating averaged just 7%, indicating an anti-abortion rights stance.[28] He was singled out by NARAL President Nancy Keenan for strong criticism over his support of H.R. 3 ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act"", which, among other things, would deny tax credits to small businesses that purchase health insurance plans offering abortion coverage. Reps. Lance and Frelinghuysen have traded in their moderate credentials to become foot soldiers in Speaker Boehners War on Women, Keenan said.[25]
Environment
Frelinghuysen is a member of Republicans For Environmental Protection and was the sponsor of the Highlands Conservation Act, a piece of environmental protection legislation that directs federal funding towards preservation of the Highlands region of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.
However, the Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Frelinghuysen has the third-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[29] Frelinghuysen's scores from the League of Conservation Voters dropped sharply after 2008, from the 42-67% range during 1999-2008 to 21-23% during 2009-12. During the 2011-12 Congress, his League of Conservation Voters rating was 11th out of thirteen members of the House from New Jersey, and 4th among the six Republicans from the state.[30]
Since the start of his congressional tenure in 1995, Frelinghuysen has been the chief sponsor of 123 bills. Of these, four have become law:
He has also been the chief sponsor of nine resolutions, none of which passed.[19]
Frelinghuysen introduced an amendment to the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, the initial Hurricane Sandy relief legislation, which added $33.7 billion to the $17 billion initially allocated by the act. The amendment passed the House in a 228-192 vote, with the support of 38 Republicans and 190 Democrats.[31] The amended act was not significantly modified by the Senate, and was signed into law.
Frelinghuysen is a supporter of earmarking, calling the practice a ""constitutional responsibility.""[32] He is one of the most prolific earmarkers in the House, consistently ranking in the top 5% in terms of dollars procured. In fiscal year 2008 he ranked 21st, sponsoring or co-sponsoring 44 earmarks totaling $88 million; in fiscal year 2009 he ranked 12th, with 45 earmarks totaling $119 million; and in in fiscal year 2010 he ranked 21st with 39 earmarks totaling $76 million. During the same period, Frelinghuysen was the top earmarker among New Jersey lawmakers.[15] The majority of his earmarks were for defense-related expenses.[33]
In June 2013, Frelinghuysen was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the Navys highest civilian honor, for the ""long and selfless service"" he had provided to the force, ensuring it had necessary resources and supporting its members' quality of life.[34]
Frelinghuysen was also awarded the Vietnam Service Medal for his service during the Vietnam War.[1]
Frelinghuysen is a member of a family long prominent in New Jersey politics, one which was ranked the seventh greatest American political dynasty by Stephen H. Hess, senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, and author of ""America's Political Dynasties"".[35]
His father, Peter Frelinghuysen, Jr., served as the U.S. Representative from New Jersey's 5th congressional district from 1953 to 1975, representing much of the same area Rodney does today. He is the great-great-grandson of Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey and U.S. Secretary of State in the administration of President Chester A. Arthur. His great-great-great-uncle (and adoptive father of Frederick Theodore) Theodore Frelinghuysen was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, served as president of both New York University and Rutgers College, and was the vice-presidential running mate of Henry Clay on the Whig ticket in the Presidential election of 1844. Great-great-great-great-grandfather Frederick Frelinghuysen was one of the framers of the first Constitution of New Jersey, a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War.[36]
Aside from the Frelinghuysen name, he is also a great-great-great-grandson of Peter Ballantine, founder of Ballantine Brewery in Newark. On his mother's side, he is a great-great-grandson of William Procter, co-founder of Procter & Gamble.[36]
At the start of the 112th Congress, Frelinghuysen was ranked the ninth wealthiest member of congress, with an estimated personal wealth between $20 million and $65 million.[37]
A CQ Roll Call report on Frelinghuysen's wealth in 2010 indicated that about a third stemmed from personal and family trust investments in Procter & Gamble stock. He also owns multiple properties, including nearly 18 acres of undeveloped land in Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey.[38]
On May 24, 2007, Frelinghuysen chased down a pickpocket who had stolen his wallet near his home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Two Washington police officers saw the chase and arrested the 18-year-old suspect who had been caught by the 61-year-old congressman.[39]"

Eleven term incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Joe Skeen decided to retire. In the Republican primary, Pearce ran and won the five candidate field with a plurality of 35%. His closest challenger was rancher and businessman Edward R. Tinsley, owner of the K-Bob's Steakhouse, who got 27%.[6] Coincidentally, both Pearce and Tinsley were reared in the small West Texas city of Lamesa in Dawson County. In the general election, Pearce defeated Democratic State Senator John Arthur Smith 56% to 44%.[7]
Pearce won re-election to a second term against Democratic State Representative Gary King 60% to 40%.[8]
Pearce won re-election to a third term against Democratic pastor Al Kissling 59% to 40%.[9]
Pearce ran for the open Senate seat of retiring six term Republican US Senator Pete Domenici. He did not run for reelection to the 2nd District, making New Mexico's 2nd District an open seat race. Democratic business owner Harry Teague defeated Republican restauranteur Edward R. Tinsley 56% to 44%. [10]
On August 1, 2009, Pearce announced his candidacy for the seat he held for three terms from 2003 to 2009. On June 1, 2010, he won the Republican primary without any serious challengers.

His press secretary, Jim Burns, admitted to having plagiarized the articles himself without Pearce's knowledge, and quickly resigned.[19]
Pearce has been a long-time advocate of oil and gas drilling in Otero Mesa.[20][21]
On October 16, 2007, Pearce announced he would run for the Republican nomination to replace Pete Domenici in the U.S. Senate.
Fellow Republican Representative Heather Wilson had previously declared her candidacy in that race.[22] In late October 2007, Pearce made 130,000 automated phone calls to justify his opposition to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) bill that would have provided health benefit to children, which the Wilson campaign claimed ""Pearce violated House ethics by urging those he called to contact him through his official, non-campaign phone number or check out his official, non-campaign Web site.""[23][24]

His father, Ben Lujn, was the speaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives[1] and his mother is a retired administrator with the Pojoaque Valley school system. He has Lujan family members on both sides of his family, including cousin Michelle Lujan Grisham, and is a distant cousin on his mother's side to Manuel Lujan, Jr., former Republican congressman and Secretary of the Interior. Manuel Lujan's sister was his second grade teacher.[2]
After graduating from Pojoaque Valley High School, he attended the University of New Mexico and later received a degree from New Mexico Highlands University.[3] Lujn has held several public service positions. He was the Deputy State Treasurer and the Director of Administrative Services and Chief Financial Officer for the New Mexico Cultural Affairs Department prior to his election to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission.

His served as chairman of the PRC in 2005, 2006 and 2007. His term on the commission ended at the end of 2008.[3]
Lujn is a strong supporter of renewable energy. He helped to increase the Renewable Portfolio Standard in New Mexico that requires utilities to use 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020. Lujn also required utilities to diversify their renewable use to include solar, wind and biomass.[3]
Lujn joined regulators in California, Oregon, and Washington to sign the Joint Action Framework on Climate Change to implement regional solutions to global warming.[4] While at the PRC, Lujn helped develop legislation to prohibit insurance companies from denying individuals coverage for preexisting conditions.[citation needed]
In 2008, Lujn ran to succeed U.S. Rep. Tom Udall in New Mexico's 3rd congressional district. Udall gave up the seat to make what would be a successful bid for the United States Senate.
On June 3, 2008, Lujn won the Democratic primary, defeating five other candidates. His closest competitor, developer Don Wiviott, received 26 percent to Lujn's 42 percent. This victory was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district.
Lujn faced Republican Dan East and independent Carol Miller in the general election and won with 57% of the vote compared to East's 30% and Miller's 13%.[5]
Lujn won re-election against Republican nominee Tom Mullins.

Lujan has been a strong proponent of health care reform, including a public option. In October 2009, Lujan gave a speech on the House floor calling for a public option to be included in the House health care bill saying We need a public option - we must demand a public option.[7]
In June 2009, Lujan voted for an amendment that would require the Secretary of Defense to present a plan including a complete exit strategy for Afghanistan by the end of the year; although, the amendment did not pass.[8] In September 2009 Lujan wrote a letter urging the Obama administration not to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan. Lujan drew on conversations he had with U.S. General Stanley McChrystal and Afghan president Hamid Karzai, when he visited Afghanistan in August 2009, in the letter.[8]
He has been active in environmental regulation and increased renewable energy production by 20% in New Mexico.[9] He is one of the leaders on energy regulation in Congress as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Green Economy and Renewable Energy Task Force he emphasizes the input of the Hispanic Community in the furthering of clean energy policy.[9] Lujn has initiated several pieces of legislation regarding renewable energy such as the SOLAR Act and he co-authored the Community College Energy Training Act of 2009. He also supports natural gas usage and the New Alternative Transportations to Give Americans Solutions Act of 2009.[9] Lujn has very high ratings with interest groups such as Environment America and the Sierra Club. His intent not only lies in the advancement of renewable energy policy, but also the involvement and education of the community (particularly the Hispanic Community) in the benefits of renewable energy.[8]
Ben Ray Lujns positions on Public Education Teaching Profession are fully supported by the National Education Association.[8] Schools in New Mexico need to lower their dropout rates and increase performance so Rep. Lujn supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to ensure teachers presence in the classroom and to invest in school improvements.[9] He is a strong proponent of globalization of the economy, and he is committed to the United States being a strong asset to that economy. In order for this to happen, he believes higher education needs to be made available to all and therefore he supports student loan reform. He cosponsored the STEM Education Coordination Act in an effort to produce more scientists and innovators in the United States to strengthen our nations contribution to the global economy.[9]
Representative Lujn considers tribal sovereignty very seriously and has fought hard to preserve it. He has tried to increase funding for BIA and IHS in the Recovery Act. Lujn also ensured that the Indian Healthcare Improvements Act was taken into account in the health insurance reform.[9] Lujn rose in opposition to the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012 and was in favor of preserving sacred Native American ground versus bulldozing it.[8] Congressman Lujn worked to create bipartisan agreement to pass the legislation enabling tribes to directly request disaster assistance from the president.[8] Lujan district contains 15 separate pueblo tribes as well as tribal lands of the Jicarilla Apache Nation and Navajo Nation.[10] In February 2009 Lujan introduced a series of five water accessibility bills that, along with improving access to water for the many communities in the district, would also give federal funds to Indian tribes. Along with Harry Teague (D-NM) and Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ) Lujan sponsored an amendment to the House health care bill that would extend the current Indian Health Care system until 2025. Tribal governments were major donors to his 2012 reelection campaign.[11]
In 2011, Rep. Lujn became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[12]"

Zeldin (born January 30, 1980) is a Republican member of the United States Congress, in New York's 1st congressional district, having defeated incumbent Congressman Tim Bishop in the general election held November 4, 2014.[3] He is currently the only Jewish Republican in Congress.


Zeldin was born on January 30, 1980 in East Meadow, New York, the son of Merrill Schwartz and David Zeldin.[4][5] He was raised in Shirley, New York, and graduated from William Floyd High School in 1998. He received a B.A. (cum laude) in political science from the State University of New York at Albany in 2001 and earned his Juris Doctor from Albany Law School in May 2003.[1][4]
Upon graduation from law school, he received an Army ROTC commission as a Second Lieutenant, assigned to the Military Intelligence Corps of the United States Army. He became a member of the New York State Bar in January 2004 at the age of 23. In 2006, Zeldin was deployed to Iraq with an infantry battalion of fellow paratroopers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. In 2007, he transitioned from active duty to the Army Reserve where he currently serves with the rank of Major. In 2008, Zeldin started a law practice in Smithtown, New York. He is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and the Jewish War Veterans.[1] He is married to Diana Zeldin, a Mormon, and they have twin daughters.[6] He and his family attend the Bnai Israel Reform Temple in Oakdale, New York where Zeldin became a Bar Mitzvah.[6]
In 2010 Zeldin ran in the New York Senate's 3rd district to challenge Democratic incumbent Brian X. Foley and defeated Foley 57%-43%. During a Women for Foley rally, a group of Zeldin supporters protested the Womens Rally by waving the Confederate battle flag, along with pro-Zeldin and pro-Carl Paladino signs. Protesters reportedly made obscene gestures at women entering the rally while yelling anti-Brian Foley, anti-Andrew Cuomo rhetoric.[7][8][9] There is no indication that Zeldin's campaign had any association with the protesters or knowledge of their activities until after the fact. Zeldin's campaign quickly released a statement stating that they do not condone the use of the Confederate flag, nor do they support the actions and antics of the protester who was photographed at the rally.[10][11]
In 2012, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Francis Genco 56%-44%.[12]
In March 2011 he secured repeal of the saltwater fishing license fee.[13] In August 2011, when Governor Cuomo directed the DEC to issue refunds to New Yorkers for saltwater fishing licenses, Lee Zeldin made the following Statement:""Governor Cuomo's unyielding leadership, vision and dedication is getting our state's fiscal house in order and stimulating our economy. Earlier this year, we passed a budget that successfully eliminated the fee to the recreational saltwater fishing license. And now the Governor is taking this one step further by directing the DEC to refund those individuals and businesses who purchased an annual fishing license for 2011. In addition, the new no-fee registry will continue to ensure that fishing remains free for all New Yorkers and make Long Island more attractive to tourist and businesses.""[14] [15]
In June 2011, he sponsored - S 5596 Revising The Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax, which repealed portions of the MTA payroll tax.[16][17]
In June 2011, Zeldin voted against -A 8354 - the Marriage Equality Act, which the Senate passed 33-29.[18] In a statement he said, ""It is my belief that marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman.""[19]
On January 14, 2013 Zeldin did not vote on S 2230 the NY SAFE Act, a key Gun Control bill that passed the Senate 43-18.[20][21]
Zeldin has a mixed record on green energy issues.[22] He supported tax credits for commercial buildings and residents who use green technology but was the only State Senator to vote against requiring organizations receiving public funds to buy Energy Star equipment. And in June 2012, Zeldin cast the only nay vote on a bill that would prohibit the sale or offer for sale of electric lamps that contain mercury in excess of specified amounts.The bill stated that light bulbs that contain significant amounts of mercury are an environmental hazard to waste streams. The bill passed the Senate, 58-1 [1] As a result of his voting record on environmental issues, in 2012 Zeldin was given a 53% rating by New York-based environmental advocacy group EPL/Environmental Advocates.[23][24] He received a rating of 28% in 2013, and 16% in 2014[25][26]
On March 17, 2014 Zeldin voted Nay on A 2597A - the NY Dream Act[27][28]
In April 2014, Zeldin assisted in securing funding in the 2014-2015 state budget for the continuation and expansion of the PFC Joseph Dwyer PTSD Peer-to-Peer Veterans Support program.[29]
On February 27, 2015, Zeldin introduced his first bill in the House of Representatives. H.R.1187 would give the VA discretion to adjust how much money is approved for veterans seeking home loans under the departments home loan program. The agency would have the authority to adjust for areas with higher costs of living such as Long Island.[30]
In 2008, he challenged Democratic Congressman Tim Bishop in New York's 1st congressional district and was defeated by Bishop 58%-42%.[31]
On October 6, 2013, Zeldin announced he would seek the Republican nomination to again run against Congressman Tim Bishop.[32] Zeldin defeated George Demos and won the Republican Party nomination[33] and ran unopposed for the Conservative Party nomination in the primary on June 24, 2014. Zeldin had the backing of former Congressman and House Majority leader Eric Cantor (R-VA: 2011  2014)[34] as well as former Congressman Allen West (R-FL: 2011-2013),[35] Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)[36] and former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA: 1995-2007).[37] He was endorsed by the US Chamber of Commerce,[38] the National Federation of Independent Business,[39] the Suffolk County Republican Committee,[40] and Suffolk County Conservative Party Chairman Ed Walsh.[41][42][43] In April 2014, when asked how he would have voted for the GOP Budget plan, Zeldin said he hadn't read the Republican budget.[44] As a result, in May 2014, a staffer for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) sent an email questioning if Zeldin is a coward for not explaining his position on the House GOP budget[45] A spokesman for the DCCC also posted a photo to Twitter of Zeldin's face superimposed on the body of the Cowardly Lion from the movie, The Wizard of Oz.[46] This angered Republicans.[47] Both Congressman Steve Israel and Tim Bishop later condemned the email, stating that they had not been aware of the comments to be made, and that they disagreed with them.[48][49]
On November 4, 2014, Zeldin defeated Bishop in the election to represent New York's First Congressional District in the United States Congress.[50]"

University of Notre Dame","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._King","Peter King","Republican","Hempstead Town Council, Nassau County Comptroller","Roman Catholic","Peter Thomas King (born April 5, 1944) is the U.S. Representative for New York's 2nd congressional district. He is a member of the Republican Party and represents the central Long Island district that includes parts of Nassau and Suffolk counties.
King formerly served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, where he drew attention in early 2011 for holding hearings on the extent of radicalization of American Muslims. He also sits on the Financial Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He stepped down as Homeland Security Chairman because of self-imposed Republican term limits. He remains a member of the committee.[2]


King was born in Manhattan, and raised in Sunnyside, Queens, New York, the son of Ethel M. (ne Gittins) and Peter E. King, who was a New York City police officer.[3] His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, from Galway. His maternal grandfather was Welsh, and his maternal grandmother was also Irish, from Limerick.[4] He graduated from St. Francis College in 1965 with a degree in political science, and earned his J.D. from Notre Dame Law School in Indiana in 1968. That same year, he began service in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the New York Army National Guard. He worked for the Nassau County District Attorney's Office until 1974, when he was honorably discharged from the 165th Infantry Regiment.[citation needed]
King first sought public office in 1977, running for an at-large seat on the Hempstead, New York Town Council and winning with the backing of the then-powerful Nassau County Republican Party machine led by Joseph Margiotta. In 1981, he successfully ran for Nassau County Comptroller again with Margiotta's support. The next year, when several prominent Republican politicians, led by then Senator Alfonse D'Amato, sought to displace Margiotta, King joined them in this internal Republican dispute; at one point, he was the only Nassau politician to do so.[5] King was re-elected in 1985 and 1989. As Comptroller, he displayed independence, often criticizing the budget proposals of County Executives Francis Purcell and later County Executive Thomas Gulotta, both Republicans.[6]
During the 1990s King enjoyed a close relationship with the Muslim community in his congressional district. King often gave speeches at the Westbury Islamic Center, held book signings in the prayer hall, took in Muslim interns, and was one of the few Republicans who supported U.S. intervention in the 1990s to help Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Muslim community thanked King for his work by making him the guest of honor for the 1993 opening of a $3 million prayer hall. For years, a picture of King cutting the ceremonial ribbon hung on the bulletin board by the mosque's entrance.[7]
King voted for the 2008 Wall Street bailout, saying it was ""necessary for the financial health of New York and his district.""[8] He opposed the 2009 economic stimulus package[9] and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.[10] In 2008, he opposed efforts to ban congressional earmarks.[8]
He was endorsed by the Brady Campaign in 2006[11] and 2008.[12]
King has been a vocal opponent of illegal immigration. He opposed John McCain's 2007 effort to enact a path to citizenship for current illegal immigrants.[8]
Although he supported John McCain for president in 2000 and despite his earlier disagreements with George W. Bush,[13][14] King later became a Bush supporter.[8] King also opposed McCain's calls for an end to coercive interrogation methods used with suspected terrorists.[8] The New York Times wrote in 2006 that King had been ""the Patriot Act's most fervent fan.""[15] In 2008, he told the Times, ""Look, we have not been attacked in seven years and it's not because of luck.""[8]
He supported the Iraq War from 2002 on.[8] King supported President Obama's order to kill Osama Bin Laden, saying that he knows it is a ""tough decision"" to make in the Situation Room. He also approved of Obama's surprise trip to Afghanistan in May 2012.[16]
King has opposed President Barack Obama's executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[17] Since 2009 King has argued against holding terrorist trials in New York City saying that enormous security risks and financial costs would accompany the public trials. In April 2011, he called for Attorney General Eric Holder to resign due to Holder's plans to transfer Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001 attacks from Guantanamo to New York City for trials in U.S. federal court. King denounced Holder's plan ""as the most irresponsible decision ever made by any attorney general.""[18] Holder had recently backed off, announcing that the trials would be held in a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.
King continued to challenge Holder in April 2011, demanding to know why the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), its co-founder Omar Ahmad, the Islamic Society of North America, the North American Islamic Trust. and other unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism financing trial, were not being prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice. In a letter to Holder, King wrote he had recently learned that the decision had been made by high-ranking Justice Department officials ""over the vehement and stated objections of special agents and supervisors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the prosecutors at the U.S. Attorneys Office in Dallas"", adding that ""there should be full transparency into the Departments decision.""[19] Holder responded that the decision not to prosecute had been made during the Bush administration. The U.S. Attorney in Dallas said he alone had been responsible for the decision, which had been made based on an analysis of the law and the evidence, with no political pressure involved.[20]
In December 2009, King commented on reports that accused attempted airline bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had admitted to being trained and equipped in Yemen and on then pending plans to release several Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen: ""I don't think Guantanamo should be closed, but if we're going to close it I don't believe we should be sending people to Yemen where prisoners have managed to escape in the past .... Obviously, if [Abdulmutallab] did get training and direction from Yemen, it just adds to what is already a dangerous situation"", he said.[21]|
King criticized the activities of WikiLeaks and in December 2010 suggested that the group be designated a ""terrorist organization"" and treated as such by U.S. agencies.[22] In 2011, King became a co-sponsor of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).[23]
King praised President Barack Obama's nominations of Leon Panetta for United States Secretary of Defense and General David Petraeus for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency saying, ""Director Panetta has done an outstanding job at the CIA, and General Petraeus has distinguished himself as one of the great American military leaders. Both men ... will be instrumental as we continue to combat the terrorist threat.[24]
King began actively supporting the Irish republican movement in the late 1970s. He frequently traveled to Northern Ireland to meet with senior members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), many of whom he counted as friends.[13][25]
King compared Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fin, the political wing of the Irish republican movement, to George Washington, and asserted that the ""British government is a murder machine"".[26] However, he did not meet Adams until 1984.[27]
King became involved[when?] with NORAID, an organization that the British, Irish and U.S. governments had accused of financing IRA activities and providing them with weapons.[13][28][29][30] Regarding the 30 years of violence during which the IRA killed over 1,700 people, mainly combatants, including Lord Mountbatten, Lord Kaberry, Sir Anthony Berry MP and over 500 civilians, King said, ""If civilians are killed in an attack on a military installation, it is certainly regrettable, but I will not morally blame the IRA for it.""[31]
He also called the IRA ""the legitimate voice of occupied Ireland"".[32] Speaking at a pro-IRA rally in 1982 in Nassau County, New York, King pledged support to ""those brave men and women who this very moment are carrying forth the struggle against British imperialism in the streets of Belfast and Derry.""[13][33] In 1985, the Irish government boycotted New York's annual St. Patrick's Day celebrations in protest at King serving as Grand Marshal of the event; the Irish government condemned him as an ""avowed"" supporter of IRA terrorism.[34] At the parade he again offered words of support for the IRA.[35]
During the murder trial of an IRA member in the 1980s, a judge in Northern Ireland ejected King from the courtroom, describing King as ""an obvious collaborator with the IRA"".[13][36] Some organizations reported that King was banned from appearing on British TV for his pro-IRA views.[citation needed]
In 1993, King lobbied unsuccessfully for Gerry Adams to be a guest at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.[35] In 2000, he called then-presidential candidate George W. Bush a tool of ""anti-Catholic bigoted forces"", after Bush visited Bob Jones University in South Carolina, described by King as ""an institution that is notorious in Ireland for awarding an honorary doctorate to Northern Ireland's tempestuous Protestant leader, Ian Paisley.""[13] King was a go-between during the Northern Ireland peace process,[37] and has said that the IRA was a ""legitimate force that had to be recognized"" in order to have peace.[38]
In 2002, King denounced Congressional investigation of the IRA-FARC links in the Colombia Three case.[39][40]
Although disgruntled by near unanimous Irish nationalist/republican opposition to the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq,[13] King nonetheless supported bail in 2008 for an Irish republican Maze escapee, Pl Brennan, who had escaped from prison in Northern Ireland in 1983. Brennan was later deported to the Republic of Ireland in April 2009.[41][42] In a 2005 interview King said he had ""cooled on Ireland"", blaming an epidemic of what he called ""knee-jerk anti-Americanism"" that swept through Ireland after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. ""I don't buy that it's just anti-Bush. There's a certain unpleasant trait that the Irish have, and it's begrudgery ... and resentment towards the Americans.""[43]
King, who often used to visit Belfast twice a year, has not visited Ireland since shortly before the September 11 attacks.[43] He claimed to have turned down an offer from the Obama administration to be the US ambassador to Ireland in 2009.[44]
At a September 2011 hearing in England concerning terrorism, King said the IRA used British torture as a recruiting tool, [clarification needed] but that it has no parallels with American treatment of suspects after 9/11. Labour MP David Winnick commented to King that ""theres been some surprise in the United States but also in Britain that you have a job looking into and investigating into terrorism"" and added that King ""seems to be an apologist for terrorism"".[45]
In 2011, King said that his ties to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been ""entirely distorted"", arguing that if the accusations were true then ""I doubt the president of the United States would have offered me the position of ambassador to Ireland.""[46]
In 2004, King claimed in an interview with conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity that ""no American Muslim leaders are cooperating in the war on terror,"" and that ""80-85 percent of mosques in this country are controlled by Islamic fundamentalists .... This is an enemy living amongst us.""[47] The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced the comments as ""Islamophobic bigotry"" and Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe called on President George W. Bush to ""condemn this latest example of hate-filled language.""[47] In a September 2007 interview with the website Politico.com, King said that ""There are too many mosques in this country... There are too many people sympathetic to radical Islam. We should be looking at them more carefully and finding out how we can infiltrate them.""[48] King later said he meant to say that too many mosques in the United States do not cooperate with law enforcement.[49]
In December 2010, King announced that, when he became Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, he would hold hearings on the radicalization of American Muslims. While allowing that, ""The overwhelming majority of Muslims are outstanding citizens,"" he claimed some Islamic clerics were telling their congregations to ignore extremism and to refrain from helping investigators.[50] King cited Justice Department statistics showing that, over the previous two years, 50 U.S. citizens had been charged with major acts of terrorism and that all were motivated by radical Islamic ideologies.[7]
The first hearing, held on March 10, 2011, was entitled ""The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community's Response."" The hearing included testimony from Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is one of two Muslims in the U.S. Congress, Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, and Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy Baca. Others to provide testimony included Dr. M Zuhdi Jasser, a Muslim and Founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy; Melvin Bledsoe, whose son, a Muslim convert, is serving a life sentence for killing a soldier and wounding another in the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting;[51][52] and Abdirizak Bihi, the Director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center.[53] The Council on American Islamic Relations submitted a statement to the committee.[54]
In an article for the National Review, King announced that his second and third Homeland Security Committee hearings on radicalization would focus on foreign money coming into American mosques and al Shababs efforts to recruit young Muslim men in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The second hearing was set for mid-May while the third was tentatively scheduled for July. King stated he would continue to hold radicalization hearings as long as he is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.[55]
Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, responded by saying that ""none of these law enforcement and intelligence officials have backed King's assertions that the Muslim community has not been helpful in thwarting terrorist attacks.""[56] Thompson wrote King, demanding that the scope of the hearings be widened to include all extremist groups in the United States, irrespective of ideology.[57] Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said that there was nothing to support King's claims of non-cooperation by American Muslims, and invited King to Los Angeles to show the cooperation between Muslim-Americans and law enforcement.[58]
The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), in a letter to King, claimed that his call was sweeping and misguided and called for a meeting with him to discuss his initiatives, the proposed hearings, and the efforts of the Muslim American community to fight radicalization.[59]
The Council on American Islamic Relations joined 50 other organizations, including Amnesty International, the Sikh Coalition, the Japanese American Citizens League and Unitarian Universalist Service Committee in signing a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, comparing the hearings to those held by Senator Joe McCarthy in the 1950s and calling them ""divisive and wrong"", and ""an affront to fundamental [American] freedoms""[60][61] A journalist for The Guardian, Seema Jilani, described King as ""America's new McCarthy"", who was instigating ""a bigoted witchhunt.""[62]
Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the conservative religious organization American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which opposed the building of the Park51 Community Center,[63] declared his support for King and the hearings and remarked, ""This hearing isnt about profiling  its about protecting our homeland.""[64]
Frank Gaffney, founder and president of the American Center for Security Policy, praised King for holding a hearing ""about an issue that has long been deemed politically untouchable"" and opined that King had indeed shown there is ""a problem of 'extremism' within the American Muslim community.""[65]
Several members of Congress, including Republican Representatives Mike Rogers of Alabama and Joe Walsh of Illinois, wrote letters of support for King's hearings. Rogers wrote that radicalization could happen anywhere in the United States, and thus it is an issue all Americans have to deal with.[66] Walsh added that Homegrown terrorists are the number one threat facing American families right now, and it would be irresponsible and negligent not to try and identify the causes of their radicalization.[67]
On July 5, 2009, shortly after the death of Michael Jackson, King made a video statement chiding the media for its coverage of Jackson's death:
Let's knock out the psychobabble. He was a pervert, a child molester, he was a pedophile. And to be giving this much coverage to him, day in and day out, what does it say about us as a country? I just think we're too politically correct. No one wants to stand up and say we don't need Michael Jackson. He died, he had some talent, fine. There's men and women dying every day in Afghanistan. Let's give them the credit they deserve.[68][69]
Due to the high-profile nature of Jackson's death, King's statement generated national media coverage. In reaction to the controversy, King said, ""I believe I'm articulating the views of a great majority of the American people"".[70]
On October 7, 2011, King commented on the Occupy Wall Street movement:
We have to be careful not to allow this to get any legitimacy. Im taking this seriously in that Im old enough to remember what happened in the 1960s when the left-wing took to the streets and somehow the media glorified them and it ended up shaping policy. We cant allow that to happen.[71][72]
On Tuesday, June 11, 2013, Peter King stated that not only should Edward Snowden be punished for releasing information to the American public that Verizon customers were being spied on, but so should the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras for publishing Edward Snowden's classified documents. On June 12, 2013, on Fox News King once again called for prosecution of Greenwald, alleging, that the journalist was said to be in possession of names of CIA agents around the world and would be ""threatening to disclose"" them. Via Twitter, Greenwald immediately refuted King's claim and called it a ""blatant lie"".[73]
King and Congressman Bill Pascrell asked Congress on March 11, 2015 to make anthrax vaccines that are about to expire and otherwise would be disposed of available to emergency responders. They made their request in a letter to fellow members of Congress shortly after King introduced the bill (H.R. 1300)[74] on March 4, 2015.[75] King previously introduced the bill in September 2014, but it was not enacted.[76]
King's committee assignments for the 113th United States Congress are:
When Democratic Congressman Robert Mrazek announced his short-lived candidacy for the Senate against Republican incumbent Alphonse D'Amato in 1992, King ran for the then vacant 3rd Congressional District seat. Despite being outspent 5-to-1,[77] King won 49.6% to 46.5%. From 1993-2008, he sometimes faced only token opposition,[78] while in other races, he ran against those who could self-finance their campaigns. Although King was outspent in those races, he would ultimately win by double-digit margins.[79] In 2006, originally Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg intended to run against King. When he dropped out shortly after his announcement, fellow legislator Dave Mejias ran instead. While some pundits believed this race would be close due to dissatisfaction with Bush,[80] King defeated Mejias 56% to 44%. King again sought re-election to Congress in 2008. The Democrats fielded 25-year-old newcomer Graham Long in a long-shot bid to defeat King.[81] King won the 2008 election with 64% of the vote.
After briefly contemplating running for Governor of New York in 2010,[82] King announced that he was seriously thinking of running for the U.S. Senate in a special election for the last two years of the term won in 2006 by Hillary Clinton, who had since been appointed Secretary of State.[83] King had contemplated running for Senate in 2000 against Hillary Clinton,[84] and even created an exploratory committee in 2003 to challenge Chuck Schumer.[85] Both times he ended up deciding against them. King said there would be no primary with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as the latter would instead opt to throw his support behind King and possibly explore a gubernatorial bid.[86]
When Kirsten Gillibrand, the representative of New York's 20th congressional district, was appointed to fill the seat until the special election by Governor David Paterson, King said he would consider holding off on making a run for the seat: ""If he appointed Caroline Kennedy, I was ready to file papers right away because shes a superstar and you cant let her build a head of steam  and she was totally unqualified in my perspective. With Kirsten, she's entitled to be given an opportunity to build a record for the state.""[87] However, two days after the Gillibrand pick, King demanded Paterson justify his selection of the congresswoman, saying there were more qualified candidates.[88] In August 2009, King ruled out a senate run; however, in January 2010, he said he was reconsidering a run.[89] King ultimately decided to run for re-election for congress, which he won with 72% of the vote.[90]
During a 2013 radio interview in New Hampshire, King said that he was in the state ""because right now I'm running for President,"" for the 2016 election.[91] However, during a March 2014 CNN interview, King said he was considering running, not that he was actively running.[92] As of May 2014, King has not filed any candidacy papers for president with the FEC.[93]
King had earlier characterized a potential candidacy as being opposed to potential Tea Party movement candidates such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, whom he criticized for their national defense policies, calling them ""isolationists who barely mention the threat of Islamic terrorism.""[94] He later opposed Republican efforts to tie the repeal of delay of the Affordable Care Act to a continuing resolution before and during the 2013 government shutdown,[95][96] and accused Tea Party conservatives of trying to ""hijack the party.""[97]
Third party candidates omitted, so percentages may not add up to 100%.
King resides in Seaford, New York with his wife, Rosemary Wiedl King, with whom he has two children. King has authored three novels: Terrible Beauty, Deliver Us From Evil, and Vale of Tears.[98]"

""Steve"" Israel[1] (born May 30, 1958) is the United States Representative for New York's 3rd congressional district, serving in the United States Congress since 2001. The district, numbered as the 2nd district from 2001 to 2013, includes portions of northern Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, as well as a tiny portion of Queens in New York City. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee until November 2014. Before serving in Congress, he served on the Huntington, New York town board. He was born in New York.


Israel was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in Wantagh, on Long Island. He graduated from Nassau Community College and George Washington University. At George Washington University, he worked as an aide for Robert Matsui and then Richard Ottinger. Israel went on to become Suffolk County director of the American Jewish Congress. In 1987 he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the county legislature. After this defeat, he spent three years working as an aide to the Suffolk County executive and founded a PR and marketing firm.[2]
He was elected to the town council in Huntington, New York, in 1993. While there, he reportedly convinced the Republican supervisor to switch parties. A town official said that he persuaded colleagues to move for pay raises while opposing them himself, which was seen as a politically safer move.[3]
After Rick Lazio left his House seat to run for the United States Senate in 2001, Israel was elected to his seat, receiving 48% of the vote, defeating Republican Joan Jonhson, who received 34%, and four independent candidates.[4] He has been reelected six times with relatively little difficulty, despite representing a district that is a swing district on paper.
Israel supports allowing abortions to be legal in cases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. He does not support abortions being legal in all cases.[5] He has voted against bills that would prohibit federal funding for abortions, a bill that would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions, and the Abortion Pain Act, which would prevent abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. He has received 100% ratings from the pro-choice groups NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, as well as 0% ratings from the National Right to Life Committee, consistently since 2004.
Steve Israel supports increased regulation on gun ownership. He voted against several bills and amendments which would decrease federal regulation of safety precautions of guns and decrease federal regulations on the sale of firearms. He also cosponsored the 2009 No Fly, No Buy act,[6] stating Gun safety measures like the 'No Fly, No Buy' Act should be a no brainer for every Member of Congress. It's common sense legislation.[7] He has received a 0% rating from the pro gun rights NRA and the Gun Owners of America, as well as a 100% rating from the pro gun regulation Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.[8] Israel was an original cosponsor of the bill To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress), which passed the House on December 3, 2013.[9] The bill would extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 another ten years, but not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).
Steve Israel voted for the 2010 Affordable Care Act,[10] and against several bills to repeal it.[8]
Israel supports legalizing same sex marriage. In a press release in June 2009, he said Im proud of what Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Vermont have done for marriage equality. I hope that my home state of New York will soon follow. [11] His home state did follow, as New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011.
He also voted for the repeal of Don't ask, don't tell, and for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.[8]
He has a 100% rating from the pro LGBT rights Human Rights Campaign and a 0% rating from the Family Research Council.[5]
Israel voted to authorize George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, even though over 60% of his Democratic colleagues in the House voted against the bill.[12]
In his second term, Israel was tapped for a leadership position as Assistant Whip. In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 members of Congress who will outreach to the defense community and advise the House Democratic Leadership on military policy. In 2006, Israel harshly criticized Jimmy Carter for his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid and at the same time criticized the Palestinian government.[13]
Israel supported a study on the feasibility of switching from Tuesday to weekend voting.[14]
Israel's support for Occupy Wall Street drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored ""anti-Semitic"" elements. Outraged at this, Israel pointed towards his support for Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.[15]
As an ally of Nancy Pelosi, Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to Chris Van Hollen, the then-chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was ""just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi.""[16]
It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where ""Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections."" It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel was one of the few Democrats to run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.[3]
Steve Israel was an honorary member of the gala host committee for a Gala dinner on October 27, 2009 by J Street, a liberal,[17][18][19] nonprofit lobbying group. In the weeks leading up to the Gala dinner, those aligned with the Likud, the political party of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, criticized Rep. Israel and those supporting J Street. The Weekly Standard blogger Michael Goldfarb called the J Street dinner an ""anti-Israel bash.""[20] In response, Lindsay Hamilton, Rep. Israel's spokeswoman said ""It's absurd that this has become a controversy...The congressman agreed to be on the gala host committee. That doesn't mean he agrees with every viewpoint of every speaker at the event"".[21]
New York election law allows for fusion voting, where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000, Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also run as the candidate for the Independence Party, and the Working Families Party. In 2000, the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the Conservative Party of New York.
Israel was divorced from his second wife, Marlene Budd, who is an acting NYS Supreme Court Judge.[23] The sale of his marital home was and is the subject of some considerable controversy.[24] This is due to the fact that he has received financial contributions from the lenders who gave him a favorable deal on a short sale of his marital home following his second divorce.[25]"

Touro Law Center","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Rice","Kathleen Rice","Democratic","Nassau County District Attorney","Roman Catholic","Kathleen Maura Rice (born February 15, 1965) is the United States Representative for New York's 4th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party.
Prior to serving in Congress, she served as Nassau County District Attorney, and, prior to that, she served as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneys Office in Philadelphia and as an assistant district attorney in the Kings County District Attorneys Office in New York City.
Rice announced on January 29, 2014, that she would run for Congress in 2014 in New York's 4th congressional district to replace retiring Democratic incumbent Carolyn McCarthy.[1] Rice won the election over Republican Bruce Blakeman on November 4, 2014[2] and took office in January 2015.


Rice was born in Manhattan, New York to Laurence and Christine Rice. She grew up in Garden City, on Long Island, as one of 10 siblings. Rice graduated from Garden City High School. She received a B.A. from The Catholic University in 1987 and a J.D. from The Touro Law Center in 1991.[3]
Rice began her career as an assistant district attorney in the Kings County District Attorneys Office, under District Attorney Charles Hynes in 1992. She prosecuted cases involving burglaries, robberies and sexual assaults and was the first member of her class to be promoted to the homicide bureau.
In 1999, Rice was appointed assistant United States Attorney in Philadelphia by then-Attorney General Janet Reno. As a federal prosecutor, she prosecuted white-collar crimes, corporate fraud, gun and drug cases, and public corruption.[4]
Rice was elected Nassau County District Attorney in 2005, winning by 7,500 votes to become the first female to hold the position. She defeated 31-year incumbent Denis Dillon, who had generally won reelection easily, even after switching his affiliation from Democratic to Republican in 1989. Rice was the first serious opponent that Dillon had faced since his first run in 1974.[5]
Rice was re-elected in 2009 and 2013.
In 2006, Rice, the ""state's toughest DWI prosecutor,""[6] declared her first major policy initiative to be an assault on the drunk driving epidemic. She lowered the blood-alcohol level at which you could take a plea bargain,[7] supported Leandras Law, and charged some drunk drivers who killed their victims with murder.[8]
In September 2011, Rices office arrested seven students after uncovering an SAT cheating ring on Long Island.[9] When this case led to the discovery of a wider-spread cheating scandal, Rice worked with the College Board, who administers the test, to update security standards to halt cheating in the future. This effort sparked other test administrators, like that which gives the ACT[disambiguation needed], to update their standards as well.[10]
Rice has also received credit for teen education programs geared towards cyber bullying, drug use, sexting and dangerous driving.[11][12][13]
In 2007, Rices office, Nassau County and Hempstead (village) police led a counter-assault on Terrace Avenue, a major drug haven and crime-ridden street in Long Islands Hempstead Village. Through a combination of zero-tolerance enforcement for repeat and violent offenders, and social-service based jail diversion for nonviolent and first time offenders, crime has been reduced in the area.[14]
In 2008, following the trampling death of a Walmart employee at one of the retailers Black Friday sales events, Rice encouraged Walmart to upgrade its security protocols at its nearly 100 New York stores.[15]
In 2012, Rice came out in favor of decriminalizing small amounts of plain view marijuana.[16] Rice has also supported efforts to allow some citizens to seal prior low-level, non-violent convictions in the hopes of improving their chances of obtaining employment.[17]
Rice was chosen by Governor Andrew Cuomo to be a member of the Moreland Commission on Utility Storm Preparation and Response, a panel tasked with investigating the failures of the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) following Hurricane Sandy of October 2012. The panel recommended that LIPA be replaced by a private, investor-owned company and that the Public Service Commission, which has regulation authority, be given more power to penalize and fine poor-performing utility companies.
Rice supports the Raise the Age NY initiative to treat non-violent teen offenders as juveniles in the criminal justice system.[18]
Rice has aggressively implemented gun buy-back programs in some of the countys most crime-plagued areas, which have removed more than 2,000 guns[citation needed]. She also spoke out in favor of Governor Andrew Cuomos gun control legislation,[19] and she created the offices first ever gun prosecution unit.[20] Rice announced in early 2011 a major prosecution of 9 gun dealers and gun store employees arrested by police in an undercover operation investigating alleged illegal assault weapons.[21] This was the second arrest for Martin Tretola, one of the gunshop owners. He was previously arrested on firearms related violations in 2007. Subsequently, in 2012, a federal jury delivered a verdict rejecting the charges of Nassau County and District Attorney Rice for the 2007 arrest and awarded Tretola 3 million dollars in compensatory damages and 2 million dollars in punitive damages.[22] This judgment was later reduced to 1.3 million dollars in total upon appeal.[23]
Questions on Rices early prosecution cases
The Kings County district attorneys prosecution of Antowine Butts for double homicide imploded and ended in an acquittal in 2000, but not before Butts spent two years in a Rikers Island jail cell. After the case unraveled, Butts alleged that he was a victim of prosecutorial misconduct in a civil rights lawsuit that was settled with New York City.
Among those named in that suit: Kathleen Rice, the architect of the case against Butts. Despite that high profile, Rice has largely escaped attention  including during the current campaign  for starting her career in an office in which prosecutors are alleged to have put some innocent people behind bars with coerced confessions, bogus witness statements, coached lineup identifications and other tactics.[24]
In April 2013, Rice announced the arrest of 18 members of the Rollin 60s gang, an ultra-violent subset of the Crips. Rice charged these defendants with crimes ranging from attempted murder of a police officer, to assault and robbery, to gun and drug sales.[25]
Among those Rice has charged and convicted of corruption include a deputy police commissioner,[26] a Long Beach City Council member,[27] former Nassau County legislators,[28] and several town building department employees.[29]
In July 2013, Kathleen Rice was appointed by Governor Cuomo to be one of three co-chairs of the Moreland Commission on Public Corruption. The work of the commission is currently ongoing.[30]
Rice formed Nassaus first-ever Medicaid and public assistance fraud unit, which has since secured millions of dollars in restitution for Nassau taxpayers.[31]
Rice has reformed the recruiting, hiring and promotional practices of her office. She eliminated a gender pay gap that had previously been greater than 30%. Rice developed an aimed at offering flex-and part-time work schedules to those needing to care for a family member or a personal situation. Half of the attorneys and management in Rices office are women.[32]
In 2010, Rice ordered the review of a 1987 case in which Arnold Friedman and his son, Jesse, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing young boys in their Great Neck, Long Island home. Rice formed a panel of outside experts  including the Innocence Projects Barry Scheck  to examine whether or not Jesse Friedman had wrongfully confessed. In a 172-page report released in July 2013, investigators found that Friedman had not been wrongfully convicted.[33]
In May 2010, Rice announced that she would seek the Democratic nomination for New York State Attorney General. The race pitted Rice against four Democratic opponents: then-State Senator Eric Schneiderman, former prosecutor Sean Coffey, former State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, and former insurance commissioner Eric Dinallo. Though originally considered a long shot, Rice would narrowly lose the five-way primary to Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 34% to 32%.[34]
In July 2013, Rice was inducted as President of the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York (DAASNY).[35]
In 2005, Kathleen Rice returned home to Nassau County and declared her candidacy for District Attorney on the Democratic line. Rice challenged 30-year incumbent DA Denis Dillon. Throughout the campaign, Rice provided an alternative to Dillon, pledging to cut plea bargaining and touting her would-be zero tolerance policy for drunk driving. Rice also committed herself to modernizing the offices approach to domestic violence and crimes of sexual abuse. Rice edged out Dillon 51%49% in the November election.[36]
In 2009, Rice was challenged by Law Clerk Joy Watson. Rice defeated Watson 54%46%.
In 2010, Rice ran for Attorney General of the State of New York in the Democratic Primary.
In 2013, Rice was challenged by Law Secretary Howard Sturim. Rice defeated Sturim 59%41%.
In June, 2014, Rice won the Democratic primary election for U.S. House of Representatives in New York's fourth congressional district, defeating Nassau County Legislator Kevan Abrahams 56%-44%.[37]
In November, 2014, Rice was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in New York's fourth congressional district, defeating Republican candidate Bruce Blakeman 53%-47%.[38]"

Howard University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Meeks","Gregory Meeks","Democratic","New York State Assembly","African Methodist","Gregory Weldon Meeks (born September 25, 1953) is the U.S. Representative for New York's 5th congressional district, formerly in the 6th District since 1998. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district formerly included, in the last congress, most of southeastern Queens, including Jamaica, Laurelton, Rosedale, Cambria Heights, Saint Albans, Springfield Gardens, Far Rockaway, and the John F. Kennedy International Airport. His district is made up mainly of middle and upper middle-class African-American and West Indian American communities, but also included a small part of Ozone Park and part of Howard Beach known as Old Howard Beach, both of which are predominantly middle-class Italian-Americans communities. In addition, he represented much of Kew Gardens and northern Richmond Hill.


Born in East Harlem, New York City and raised in a housing project, Meeks attended Adelphi University and obtained a law degree from Howard University School of Law. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[1]
He worked as an Assistant District Attorney and Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York before joining the Investigations Commission on official misconduct and organized crime. He then was Supervising Judge for the New York State Workers Compensation System.
Meeks was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1992.
Meeks is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the International Conservation Caucus and the New Democrat Coalition.
On the U.S. Federal Budget, Meeks supports Social Security and Medicare and wants to balance the budget, lower the national debt while sending money to education, environment and national defense.[2] He is also against the privatization of Social Security.[3] On Homeland Security, Gregory Meeks has unwavering support of on-ground troops, and a large supporter of veterans and emergency responders.[4] Finally, Gregory Meeks is a strong supporter of the Health Care plan and is currently working to promote the extension and expansion of the States Childrens Health Insurance Program. He has also worked hard to increase the federal funding to research fields to speed cures.[5]
Meeks is pro-choice on abortion, and he supported Planned Parenthood all throughout his career. His votes, such as voting against the prohibition of late-term or partial birth abortions, twice in 2003 against the Republicans, support and strengthen his position on abortion. However, in the recent 2008 election for funding federal money to abortions, he voted against it.[6] He is supported by NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association. He is not supported by National Rights to Life Committee.[7]
Meeks is for animal rights and he never supported or voted for the organizations supporting hunters and animals owners based on his votes in Congress. He is also a supporter of endangered species and voted to protect them. In the 2005 Endangered Species Reauthorization Bill, he voted against the Republicans in vain.[8] He is supported by the Humane Society of the United States, Big Cats Rescue and is not supported by Sportsmen and Animal Owners Voting Alliance.[6]
Meeks is not supported by the Americans for Fair Taxation, which wants to the change the tax system, so a clean slate is given to every American and he or she is taxed equally by using retail sales tax. However, this would banish Social Security, Medicare and other government-supported plans.[9] Also, the National Taxpayers Union does not support Meeks.[10]the National Taxpayers Union strives to change the current tax system to make it simpler to the individual[11] Similarly, he is not supported by the National Tax Limitation Committee and Americans for Tax Reform, which have supported more Republicans than Democrats.[clarification needed] None of these groups have overwhelmingly supported Gregory Meeks since he has been a representative of New York.[12]
Meeks has supported the Bush Administration wiretapping programs that were undertaken without the attainment of a warrant.
During the 2008 electoral campaign, Meeks appeared in a television advertisement[13] endorsing the reelection of Puerto Rico Governor Anbal Acevedo Vil.
On March 3, 2015, Meeks participated with fellow Democrats in the boycott of the speech delivered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress.[14]
On August 25, 2007, Silvestre Reyes, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee, and four other US Congressmen visited American troops deployed in the southern Philippines, to overview the US-Philippines relationship. Reyes headed the bipartisan delegation which included New Jersey Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, member of appropriations committee and the select intelligence oversight panel; New Mexico Rep. Heather Wilson of the committee on energy and the intelligence committee; New York Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat, of the financial services and international relations committees; and Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of the appropriations and intelligence committees. They drove to the base of the Joint Special Operation Task Force Philippines (JSOTFP), a US-led body, which trains Filipino soldiers against terror, in Barangay Upper Calarian.[15]
On December 20, 2007, together with two other US representatives (Bill Delahunt and Jim McGovern), Meeks wrote a letter thanking the head of the leftist Colombian guerilla organization FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, in Spanish) for the release of evidence that confirmed the survival of several of the forty-five hostages that the terrorist groups held captive (including three US citizens), some of them for over a decade. The group is considered a terrorist organization by the US government and the European Union (EU).
It was recently noted by the New York Times that Meeks utilizes the option to use tax dollars to lease a car, for use as a member of Congress. This option does not exist for Senate members. The lease is forgone by many members of Congress, but Meeks has held the most-expensive lease among all members. He has used tax dollars to lease a 2007 Lexus LS 460, at $998 per month. Meeks was unwilling to provide further comment when questioned by the New York Times, on the lease arrangement, saying, ""These are never lighthearted stories."" [16]
Meeks was criticized for initially supporting Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama for President. His House primary election challenger was to be Ruben Wills, a former chief of staff for State Senator Shirley L. Huntley and an organizer for Obama. Wills said, ""I was on board with Obama from Day 1; Meeks had to be dragged across the line."" Some suggested that a young black political class was seeking to assert the neighborhoods power against what it saw as an older establishment, based in Harlem, that had long exercised disproportionate influence in New York City.[17][18] Wills did not qualify for the ballot, resulting in no primary election taking place.
In late 2009, and ongoing through 2010, Greg Meeks has been investigated by a House ethics committee on loans with New York Senate Temporary President Malcolm Smith and his pastor, the local Jamaica Rev. Floyd Flake. Meeks has also been investigated about his mortgage loans to a Guyanese immigrated real estate tycoon Edul N. Ahmad of Century21 Ahmad Realty and Ace Mortgage, Inc. Meeks has denied this, although being investigated by the New York State Attorney General's office and the House Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee unanimously determined that Congressman Gregory Meeks did not knowingly or willfully fail to disclose the loan and recognized that unknowing failures to report such items are not uncommon. Representative Meeks has since corrected the omissions in his Financial Disclosure Statements filed in June 2010 and, therefore, no further action by the Ethics Committee is warranted.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) named Meeks one of the most-corrupt members of Congress in 2011.[19] It was subsequently reported that Meeks' continuing ethical and criminal probes would cause his premature exit from Congress;[20] however, Meeks has denied this.[21] Hip hop artist and law school graduate Mike Scala announced in October 2011 to run for office against Meeks.[22] However, Meeks won the Democratic primary and was re-elected with 89.7% of the general election vote in November 2012.
Ethnically, Gregory Meeks is of African-American heritage, and according to a DNA analysis, he descended, mainly, from people of Sierra Leone.[23]"

Previously, she served as a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 22nd assembly district in Flushing, Queens, New York.


Grace Meng was born and raised in Queens. She attended Nathaniel Hawthorne Middle School 74 and is a graduate of Stuyvesant High School. She received a B.A. degree from the University of Michigan and a Juris Doctor from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.[2]
Grace Meng's father Jimmy Meng was elected in 2004 to New York's 22nd assembly district, becoming the first Asian American to be elected to the legislature in New York State history.[3] Jimmy served only one term, having decided to not run for re-election in 2006 following a scandal regarding election irregularities in his first campaign. He subsequently pleaded guilty to bribery charges. He only served one month in jail for his crime. Grace Meng decided to run to succeed her father, but was taken off the ballot when Democrat Ellen Young, challenged her residency status.[4] Subsequently her district residency issues were resolved.[5] Ellen Young succeeded Jimmy Meng in 2006.
In 2008, Grace decided to challenge Young again. On September 9, 2008, Grace defeated the incumbent in the Democratic primary 59%-41%.[6][7] She went on to win the 2008 November election, defeating Young again, this time as an Independence Party nominee, 88%-12%.[8] In 2010, she won re-election to a second term unopposed.[9][10][11]
In 2008, she was named on of City & State's ""New York City Rising Stars: 40 Under 40"" for being a young influential member in New York City politics.
She was the author of the Reverse Mortgage Act of 2009, that prohibited proceeds received from reverse mortgages from being considered as income, so senior citizens can get their partial property tax exemption. Seven other of her pieces of legislation were signed into law.[12]
In June 2012, Meng faced fellow Assembly member Rory Lancman and New York City Council member Elizabeth Crowley in a primary election for New York's 6th congressional district and won. She received the endorsement of the Queens County Democratic party.[14] On November 6, 2012, Meng won the race for New York Congressional District 6 against Republican member of the New York City Council Dan Halloran, making her the first Asian American elected to Congress from New York.[15]
She was inaugurated on January 3, 2013. Meng has co-formed the Bipartisan Freshman Caucus saying The American people are just sick and tired of blaming each other without getting anything done.[16]
Her district includes the Queens neighborhoods of Auburndale, Bayside, Briarwood, Elmhurst, Flushing, Forest Hills, Fresh Meadows, Glendale, Kew Gardens, Kew Gardens Hills, Maspeth, Middle Village and Rego Park.
On February 10, 2014, Meng introduced the bill To amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to include the desecration of cemeteries among the many forms of violations of the right to religious freedom (H.R. 4028; 113th Congress) into the House.[17] The bill would amend the findings of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 by including the desecration of cemeteries among the various violations of the right to religious freedom.[17][18] Meng said that ""this legislation would be a new and important tool in our fight against the desecration of cemeteries"" because it would ""combat religiously-motivated vandalism of cemeteries and also prevent developers from building over cemeteries, a new and emerging threat in places where there are no Jewish communities left to protect burial grounds.""[19]
Meng resides in Queens with her husband Wayne and their two sons, Tyler and Brandon.[2]
Grace Meng's father is Jimmy Meng, who in 2004, became the first Asian American ever elected to the New York State legislature.[20] He only served one term because of controversies. On March 12, 2013, Jimmy Meng left Brooklyn Federal Court after he was sentenced to a month in jail and a $30,000 fine for his role in the bribery scheme.[21]"

New York University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nydia_Vel%C3%A1zquez","Nydia Velzquez","Democratic","Director, Dept. of Puerto Rican Community Affairs","Roman Catholic","Nydia Margarita Velzquez (born March 28, 1953) is an American politician who has served in the United States House of Representatives since 1993. Velzquez, a Democrat from New York, is the first Puerto Rican woman to be elected to Congress, and she was the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus until January 3, 2011. Her district, located in New York City, was numbered the 12th district from 1993 to 2013 and has been numbered the 7th district since 2013.


Velzquez, whose father worked the sugar cane fields, was one of nine siblings born in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. During her upbringing, political dinner conversations were commonplace. Her father was a local political activist and she would accompany him to political rallies, starting at a young age. Her father focused on the rights of sugar cane workers and denounced the abuses of wealthy farmers.[1]
After skipping a grade, she entered high school when she was 13. While a student, she organized a protest to draw attention to the school's dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The protest resulted in the school temporarily closing down so that the necessary renovations could be made.
At age 16, Velzquez enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, Ro Piedras. In 1974, she graduated magna cum laude and became the first member of her family to receive a college degree. She then went to New York City to attend New York University, where she received a scholarship to study political science. In 1976, she received her Master's degree.[1]
Velzquez was a professor, first at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao from 1976 to 1981, and then at New York's Hunter College from 1981 until 1983.[1]
Throughout her career, Velzquez has been an advocate of many Latino rights programs and associations. During her tenure as the Director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States, Velzquez initiated one of the most successful Latino empowerment programs in the nations history - ""Atrvete"" (Dare to Go for It!). She taught Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College and became the first Latina woman to serve on the New York City Council.
In 1983, Velzquez was appointed Special Assistant to Representative Edolphus Towns (D-Brooklyn). In 1984, she became the first Latina appointed to serve as a member of the New York City Council. In 1986, she served as the Director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs of the U.S. During that time, she initiated a successful Latino empowerment program called ""Atrvete""(dare to go for it).[1]
Velzquez has represented a progressive shift in the House. Although some thought that she would be facing a political decline due to factors such as ""the redrawing of the district's boundaries in 1997 to include fewer Latinos, and the gradual decline of the Puerto Rican population in New York,"" she has persevered. As reasoning, commentators have suggested ""her ability to forge alliances at home and in the House"".[2]
Velzquez is an important national leader for Hispanics. In 2003, Hispanic Business Magazine honored her with its first ""Woman of the Year"" award, citing her support of minority small-business owners.[2] As a Representative, Velzquez has focused on building a legislative agenda that lobbies to increase the opportunities for the nation's 47 million Hispanics, including the over 2.3 million Hispanics currently residing in New York City.[3]
Throughout her career as a New York Representative, Nydia Velzquez has consistently and fully supported pro-choice and family-planning interests groups such as the NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Planned Parenthood. Velzquez has consistently shown support of the National Farmers' Union. She has shown no support of interests groups that are against animal rights and animal rightists.[4]
In 2009, Velzquez voted against the amendment Prohibiting Federally Funded Abortion Services. In the past year, Velzquez has supported the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations, the Unemployment Benefits Association, and the Unemployment Benefits Extension. Velzquez has also consistently voted in favor of bills attempting to strengthen women's rights, such as the Employment Discrimination Law Amendments, Equal Pay Bill and the Inclusion of Consolidated Appropriations.[4]
On September 29, 2008, Congresswoman Velzquez voted in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. On November 19, 2008, Congresswoman Velzquez was elected by her peers in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) to lead the group for the 111th Congress.[1]
Prior to removing her name from consideration, she was considered a possible candidate to be appointed to the United States Senate by Governor David Paterson after New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was nominated to be a member of President Barack Obama's cabinet.[5]
Among her firsts are: the first Hispanic woman to serve on the New York City Council; the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in Congress; the first woman Ranking Democratic Member of the House Small Business Committee. Velzquez became the first woman to chair the United States House Committee on Small Business in January 2007 as well as the first Hispanic woman to chair a House standing committee.[1]
While at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus event in December 2011, Velzquez told a Daily Caller report that she did not know what ""Operation Fast and Furious"" was. Fellow New York Democrat, Rep. Jos Enrique Serrano, also admitted to The Daily Caller that he was unaware of ""Fast and Furious"".[6]

In 1992, Velzquez defeated incumbent congressman Stephen J. Solarz in the primary and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing New York's 12th congressional district, and became the first female Puerto Rican member of Congress. The sprawling 12th district encompasses parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan. It includes such neighborhoods as Ridgewood, Maspeth, and Woodside in Queens; Bushwick, Williamsburg, Red Hook, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; and part of Manhattan's Lower East Side. She also became the first Hispanic woman to serve as Ranking Democratic Member of the House Small Business Committee. The committee oversees federal programs and contracts totaling $200billion annually. She also serves on the House Financial Services Committee.[1]
During her campaign for the House seat, her medical records, including documented clinical depression and an attempted suicide, were leaked to the press. She quickly held a press conference and said that she had been undergoing counseling for years and was emotionally and psychologically healthy.[7]
Velzquezs 2010 campaign income was $759,359. She came out of this campaign with about $7,736 in debt. Her top contributors include Goldman Sachs, the American Bankers Association, the National Roofing Contractors Association and the National Telephone Cooperative Association.[4]
Velzquez, who was redistricted into the 7th Congressional District, defeated her Democratic contenders to win the Democratic nomination.[8] Her top contributors included Goldman Sachs, the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America.[9]
Velazquez has been criticized by her primary opponents Jeff Kurzon for her close ties to the banking industry and her reluctance to support reform and transparency measures. A majority of her campaign contributions have come from banks, including Goldman Sachs and the American Bankers Association.[9] Opponents have suggested that these contributions influenced her votes in support of the bailouts and her votes against reform and transparency measures.[10] In addition to support for private banks, Ms. Velazquez voted against bi-partisan House efforts to audit the federal reserve, both in 2009 and in 2012.[11]
In 2012, Congresswoman Velazquez was named by the American Small Business League (ASBL) as the most anti-small business member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The ASBL points to the fact that Rep. Velazquez blocked legislation, including H.R. 3184, The Fairness and Transparency in Contracting Act,"" that would prevent large corporations from claiming billions of dollars worth of federal contracts reserved for small businesses. ASBL claims that Velazquez also voted to divert billions in federal contract dollars earmarked for small businesses to firms such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BlackWater and Italian defense firm Finmeccanica.[12]

Prior to that he was a corporate lawyer for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison then Viacom and CBS, before running for and serving in the New York State Assembly from 2007 to 2012, representing the 57th Assembly district.[3][4]


He grew up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and received his bachelor's in political science from Binghamton University with honors. Additionally, he graduated from New York University School of Law and obtained a master's degree in public policy from Georgetown University.[2]
He served as a clerk for Judge Harold Baer, Jr., then worked in the litigation department of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison before becoming assistant litigator for Viacom and CBS.[5][6]
In 2000, he challenged incumbent Democratic Assemblyman Roger Green in the primary who defeated him 59 percent to 41 percent.[7][8] In the general election, Jeffries ran on the Independence Party line, and Green defeated him again, this time 90 percent to his 7 percent.[9]
Two years later, after redistricting, his residence was put out of the 57th Assembly District. Jeffries claimed in the 2010 documentary film Gerrymandering that it was a retaliatory move (a charge denied by Green).[10][11] He challenged Green again in the Democratic primary and lost again, by 24 points.[12][13]
In 2006 Green decided to retire from the Assembly in order to run for New York's 10th congressional district against incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Ed Towns. Jeffries ran for the 57th district again and won the Democratic primary, defeating Bill Batson and Freddie Hamilton 64 percent to 25 percent and 11 percent.[14][15][16] In the general election, he handily defeated Republican nominee Henry Weinstein.[17]
Two years later, in 2008, he won re-election to a second term, defeating the Republican candidate Charles Brickhouse, with 98 percent of the vote.[18] In 2010 he won re-election to a third term, easily defeating the Republican candidate Frank Voyticky.[19]
During his three years in the legislature he introduced over 70 bills during his service in legislative session.[20] In response to a series of toy recalls, he introduced bill A02589, which would penalize retailers and wholesalers who knowingly sell to the public hazardous or dangerous toys that have been the subject of a recall.
He also wrote and sponsored the hotly contested house bill A. 11177-A (now law) that eliminated the stop-and-frisk database used by police forces in New York City.[21][22] He is a cautious supporter of Bruce Ratner's controversial Atlantic Yards project.[15]
Jeffries announced he would give up his seat to run in New York's 8th congressional district in 2012. The district had previously been the 10th, represented by 30-year incumbent Democrat Edolphus Towns. Jeffries expected to give Towns a strong challenge in the Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district.[24][25][26] However, Towns announced his retirement on April 16, leaving Jeffries to face city councilman Charles Barron in the Democratic primary.[27]
On June 11, 2012, former Mayor Ed Koch, Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Councilman David Greenfield, and Assemblyman Dov Hikind gathered with several other elected officials to support Jeffries and denounce Barron. The officials described Barron as anti-Semitic and denounced his allegedly anti-Semitic statements, while also denouncing his support of Zimbabwe ruler Robert Mugabe and former Libya ruler Muammar Gaddafi.[28] Barron responded that such attacks were a distraction from bread and butter issues.[29]
Green Party candidate Colin Beavan called on Jeffries to ""get the money out of politics"", noting that as of his March 2012 filing, ""he had received about $180,000, or 35 percent of his funds, from Wall Street bankers and their lawyers"". Beaven added that Jeffries gets many campaign donations from charter school backers and hedge fund managers.[30] After primary night, when asked about his two most important concerns, Jeffries replied eliminating the ""crushing burden"" of private religious school education costs.[31]
After out-raising him by hundreds of thousands of dollars,[3][32] Jeffries defeated Barron in the primary election on June 26, 2012, 72 to 28 percent. The New York Daily News analyzed Jeffries' donations in the last weeks of the campaign and found almost 50 percent came from out of state.[33] He went on to defeat Beavan and Republican Alan Bellone in the November general election with 71 percent of the vote,[3][34] but not before boycotting a debate with the other candidates, saying that the presence of the Green Party and Republican candidates at the debate would ""confuse"" voters.[35]
On January 3, 2013, Jeffries was sworn into the 113th Congress.
Since fall 2006 he has been a cautious supporter of Bruce Ratner's controversial Atlantic Yards project.[15]
He has opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, but also voted against an amendment that would have restrict sales of oil transported on the pipeline to within the United States.[36]
He is staunchly pro-Israel, saying at a rally in July 2014 ""Israel should not be made to apologize for its strength. You know why, because the only thing that neighbors respect in a tough neighborhood is strength.""
On April 11, 2013, Jeffries introduced the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).[37] Jeffries said that ""as one of America's largest revolutionary war burial sites and in tribute to the patriots that lost their lives fighting for our nation's independence, this monument deserves to be considered as a unit of the National Park Service.""[38]
On July 15, 2014, Jeffries introduced the To establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (H.R. 5108; 113th Congress), a bill that would establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to be available to accredited law schools for the ten-year period after enactment of the Act.[39]
He hand-picked and backed Laurie Cumbo in the hotly-contested race for Brooklyn's 35th district city council seat,[40][41] who moved into the district just prior to running. She became controversial for anti-semitic comments she made to explain a spate of attacks in Crown Heights.[42][43][44]
He and new Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson have supported each other's campaigns: They met while Jeffries was an intern at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District and Thompson was a prosecutor.[45]
He endorsed Bill Thompson in the 2013 NYC mayoral race, saying that he was offended by Bill de Blasio's ad featuring stop and frisk claiming himself as the only candidate who would address, modify or reform stop and frisk:
""In some ways, I'm offended by the notion that one individual, in a city of eight million people, after years and years and years of many of us, in the state legislature and the City Council, activists, marches that took place, including one on Father's Day, to get us to a point where all of the major mayoral candidates have said stop and frisk will be significantly reformed on their watch.""
His support of Thompson over de Blasio came in spite of Jeffries' own support of two policing bills, for independent inspector general for the police department and to allow for bias suits in state court, which de Blasio backed but Thompson did not. Jeffries said it made sense for Thompson, because he was running to be the city's top executive, not to support them.[46] In 2014, he supported Rubain Dorancy as Democratic candidate for state senate, who lost to Jesse Hamilton[47] by a wide margin.[48]
He is married to Kennisandra Arciniegas-Jeffries, a social worker with 1199 SEIU's Benefit Fund.[49] They have two boys, Jeremiah (born 2002) and Joshua (born 2004)[2][31] and live in Prospect Heights.[6] Jeffries is also the nephew of CUNY professor Leonard Jeffries, Jr.[31]"
"265","","2007","1964","New York 9","Oberlin College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Clarke","Yvette Clarke","Democratic","New York City Councilwoman","African Methodist","Yvette Diane Clarke (born November 21, 1964) is a Democratic member of the US House of Representatives from New York. She is ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, Science and Technology. Clark's district was numbered the 11th district from 2007 to 2013, and redistricted as the 9th district in 2013 covering much of central Brooklyn.
Before entering Congress in 2007, Clarke was a member of the New York City Council, representing the 40th council district in Brooklyn, succeeding her mother, Una S. T. Clarke.[1]


The child of Jamaican immigrant parents, Clarke has lived all her life in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush[citation needed]. Upon graduating from Edward R. Murrow High School, she earned a scholarship[citation needed] to Oberlin College in Ohio, which she attended from 1982 to 1986. She then enrolled at Medgar Evers College,[2] but did not graduate.[3]
Clarke worked as director of business development for the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation and was the second director of the Bronx portion of the New York City Empowerment Zone.[4] At some point, she interned for Congressman Major Owens.[5]
Brooklyn's 40th council district elected Clarke to the New York City Council in 2001. She succeeded her mother, former City Council member Una S. T. Clarke,[1] who held the seat for more than a decade, making theirs the first mother-to-daughter succession in city council.
As a member of the Council, she instituted an HIV/AIDS Task Force, a Sanitation Task Force, a Youth Task Force and organized an Ad Hoc Clergy Committee. She was chair of the Contracts Committee and was also co-chair of the Council's Women's Caucus. She also served on a number of other committees.
Clarke is an advocate for the empowerment of women and minorities and introduced legislation that resulted in the Council's Minority & Women-Owned Business Empowerment (MWBE) study that that found women and minority-owned businesses are not awarded their fair share of city contracts. This finding forced New York City to end its system of economic discrimination.[citation needed] As co-chair of the New York Council's Women's Caucus, Clarke secured $9.5 million in funding for organizations that addressed the issues of domestic violence prevention, breast cancer awareness, housing and HIV/AIDS counseling for women.[citation needed]
She cosponsored City Council resolutions that opposed the war in Iraq, criticized the federal USA PATRIOT Act, and called for a national moratorium on the death penalty. She was a frequent critic of the Bush administration's policies, and opposed budget cuts by Bush and the Republican Congress on several programs addressing women's rights and poverty. Perhaps contradictorily, she later voted to extend provisions of the Patriot Act after the election of President Barack Obama.[6]
The 9th district subsequently called the 11th in 2003 includes Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens and Park Slope.
Abortion
Clarke is pro-choice and during her tenure in the House of Representatives has consistently voted against legislation that would place restrictions on abortion rights, including voting against passage of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act of 2011, which sought to prohibit federal funds from being allocated to cover abortions.[7] Her voting record in support of abortion rights has led interest groups such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood to give her high ratings (100% each) while her ratings from pro-life organizations like the National Right to Life Committee have been correspondingly low (0%) within the last two years.[8]
Budget, Spending and Tax Issues
She received a 92% rating from the National Journal for being liberal on economic policy in 2011, while she received a low 15% rating from the National Taxpayers Union for her positions on tax and spending in 2011 and a 2% rating from the Citizens Against Government Waste in 2010.[8] She has consistently opposed legislation which seeks to reduce government spending and cut taxes, including voting against the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 which sought to extend tax cuts established during George W. Bush's administration through the end of 2013.[7]
Environmental Policy
Clarke received 100 percent ratings from Environment America, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Sierra Club, the latter on her clean water positions, in 2011 while she received a low rating of 14% over the period 20082011 from the Global Exchange for her loyalty to the finance, insurance, and real estate lobbies.[8] Clarke has opposed legislation which gives priority to economic over conservation interests, such as the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012 and the Conservation and Economic Growth Act of 2012, while she has supported legislation which increases conservation efforts and government regulation of industry, such as the Offshore Drilling Regulations and Other Energy Law Amendments Act of 2010.[7]
On the Colbert Report, in its ""Better Know a District"" segment in early September 2012, when Stephen Colbert asked the three-term congresswoman what she'd have changed back in 1898 (the year Brooklyn merged with New York City) if she could go back in time, the congresswoman responded the abolition of slavery. Colbert responded, ""SlaveryReally? I didn't realize there was slavery in Brooklyn in 1898,"" (Slavery was abolished in New York state in 1827.[9]) Clarke responded immediately with, ""I'm pretty sure there was"" stating that the Dutch owned slaves in New York in 1898.[9][9][10][11] The next day, the congresswoman was unavailable for comment, and her media representative stated that such a statement was meant in humor.[12]
In April 2007, Clarke was the sole member of Congress to oppose a bill authored by a Bronx Democrat that renamed the Ellis Island Library after British-born Bob Hope.[13]
On September 29, 2008, she voted in support of HR 3997, the Emergency Economic Stability Act of 2008. The act failed, 205228. She also wrote legislation written to improve the process of getting names off the No Fly List. It was passed 4133 on February 3, 2009.[14] In November 2009 she was one of 54 members of Congress that sent a letter urging President Obama to use diplomatic pressure to resolve the blockade affecting Gaza. She has since retracted her support of the letter.[why?]
On March 25, 2010, she introduced the ""International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act  H.R.4962"" before Congress.[15]
Clarke supported the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).[16] Clarke argued that the bill was a good idea because ""this monument commemorates not only the sacrifices of soldiers in the Revolutionary War who dedicated themselves to the cause of liberty, but a reminder than even in wartime we must protect basic human rights. These thousands of deaths were an atrocity that should never occur again.""[17]
On September 17, 2013, Clarke introduced the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act (H.R. 3107; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to undertake several actions designed to improve the readiness and capacity of DHS's cybersecurity workforce.[18][19] DHS would also be required to create a strategy for recruiting and training additional cybersecurity employees.[20]
In 2000, her mother ran in the Democratic primary against U.S. Congressman Major Owens, losing to him. In the 2004 election cycle, Yvette Clarke, with only two-and-a-half years' of service as an elected official, campaigned for the same seat, narrowly losing. Owens called these campaigns as well as Yvette's 2006 bid, ""long-term double-cross and stab in the back"" as Una Clarke and he had been allies,[21] and Yvette had interned for him.[5]
In May 2006, another Caribbean-American candidate, Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, withdrew from the race to succeed Congressman Major Owens, leading some observers to contend that Clarke's chances for winning the race would improve now that another candidate from the same community was no longer competing.
In August 2006, the New York Daily News uncovered the fact that Clarke was misrepresenting her educational background in her campaign literature, stating that she had graduated from Oberlin College.[22] The paper found that she didn't complete her coursework at Oberlin and had subsequently enrolled at Medgar Evers College, but did not graduate.[2][23] The questions of whether she had graduated and from which college were the subject of controversy during her 2006 campaign,[2][22][23][24][25] with her then-PR representative saying she attended Oberlin and finished at Medgar Evers  ""case closed"".[22][23] In 2011 another PR representative for the congresswoman told Crain's that the congresswoman had re-enrolled at Oberlin in order to complete the credits necessary for the awarding of her degree.[3]
On September 12, 2006, Clarke won the nomination to Congress with just 31.20% of the vote. (In multi-candidate congressional elections in New York, a plurality is sufficient to nominate.) This practically assured her of election in this overwhelmingly Democratic, black-majority district. In the general election on November 7, Clarke was elected to the House of Representatives with 89% of the vote against token Republican opposition.
Clarke was re-elected on November 4, 2008 by a large margin.
Clarke was re-elected on November 2, 2010 by a large margin.
She had $50,000 in her campaign budget before the June primary.[26]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party.
After redistricting in 2013, the 10th district now includes the west side of Manhattan from the Upper West Side down to Battery Park, including the site where the World Trade Center stood. It also includes the Manhattan neighborhoods of Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, and Greenwich Village, as well as parts of Brooklyn such as Coney Island, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, and Bay Ridge. It includes many of New York City's most popular tourist attractions, including the Empire State Building, Central Park, Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge and New York Stock Exchange.[1][2]


Nadler was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1965[3] (where his debate team partner was the future philosopher of science Alexander Rosenberg, and his successful campaign for student government president was managed by Dick Morris).[4]
Nadler graduated from Columbia University, where he became of brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi,[5] and Fordham University School of Law in 1978. He worked for Eugene McCarthy in the 1968 U.S. presidential campaign. Nadler became involved in a controversy with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1995, when he wanted the release of data concerning a bank for which the FDIC was then the receiver.
The result of the dispute was a key Second Circuit precedent on the applicability of the Freedom of Information Act to circumstances in which a public agency possesses ""trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential"".
He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 1992, sitting in the 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures.
In 1985, he ran for Manhattan Borough President. He lost the Democratic primary to David Dinkins.[6] In the general election, he ran as the New York Liberal Party nominee, and was again defeated by Dinkins.
In 1989, he ran for New York City Comptroller. In the Democratic primary, he lost to Kings County D.A. Elizabeth Holtzman.
He is credited with authoring legislation dealing with domestic violence and child support enforcement, and was one of the architects of the ""Child Support Adjustment Act"". Nadler was the only male to be honored as ""Assemblymember of the Year"" by the National Organization for Women due to his inclusion on the American Civil Liberties Unions Annual Honor Roll. It was also during his Assembly years that Nadler honed his expertise on issues of urban infrastructure.
Nadler founded and chaired the Assembly Subcommittee on Mass Transit and Rail Freight.
In 1992, Ted Weiss was expected to run for re-election in the 8th District, which had been renumbered from the 17th after the 1990 U.S. Census. However, Weiss died a day before the primary election. Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day  a special election to serve the rest of Weiss's term, and a regular election for a full two-year term. He won both handily, and has been re-elected ten times with little serious competition in one of the most Democratic districts in the country. A Republican has not represented this district or its predecessors in over a century.[7]
Nadler is a member of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary and Transportation and Infrastructure committees. He is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.[8] Despite earlier efforts to bring impeachment charges against George W. Bush,[9] and more recent requests from fellow representatives, he did not schedule hearings on impeachments for Bush or Dick Cheney, saying in 2007 that doing so would be pointless and would distract from the presidential election.[10] In a July 15, 2008, Washington Journal interview, Nadler reiterated the timing defense [11] while stating that Bush had committed impeachable offenses, but that nothing could be done because the system is ""overly political"". Ten days later, following upon submission of Articles of Impeachment by Representative Dennis Kucinich, the full House Judiciary Committee held hearings covered solely by C-SPAN [12] regarding the process. A top Ronald Reagan Justice Department official, Bruce Fein, was among those testifying for impeachment.
Nadler said in a December 2008 interview that he was interested in the U.S. Senate seat that Hillary Clinton was planning to resign to become U.S. Secretary of State in the Obama Administration. He cited his opposition to the war in Iraq, the PATRIOT Act, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 as among his principal qualifications.[13]
Nadler has also vowed to re-introduce the Freedom of Choice Act during the Obama administration.[14]
Nadler was unhappy with the passage of the surveillance-reform compromise bill, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, saying it ""abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny"".[15]
Nadler urged the Attorney General in December 2008 to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and other top Bush officials for violating the law on torturing prisoners in US custody.[16]
On September 15, 2009, Nadler, along with two other representatives, introduced the Respect for Marriage Act.[17]
Nadler compared Obama's acceptance of Republican demands to extend Bush-era tax cuts at the highest income levels to someone being roughed-up by the mob, asserting that the Republicans would only allow the middle class tax cut if millionaires and billionaires receive a long-term tax cut as well.[18]
In January 2011, Nadler called the new GOP majority's plan to read the Constitution on the House floor ""ritualistic"" and complained that it treated the Constitution like ""a sacred text"" for ""propaganda"" purposes.[19]
Nadler has proposed changing the income tax brackets to reflect different regions and their costs of living, which would have lower the tax rate for New Yorkers.[20][21] Nadler has opposed giving tax breaks to high-income earners, saying that the country cannot afford it.[18]
Nadler sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. requesting that Holder investigate whether the police monitoring the Occupy protests had deprived the protestors' Constitutional rights. It was reported that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City had ridiculed Nadler's call for an investigation into police conduct. Bloomberg suggested he would be able to make the streets safer by getting money for homeland security instead.[22]
Nadler has a liberal voting record in the House. He gained national prominence during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when he described the process as a ""partisan railroad job.""[23]
After the September 11, 2001, attacks, Nadler helped to pass bills granting economic aid to the families of those killed and small businesses that were harmed due to the attacks.
Nadler has also promoted legislation to extend Medicare benefits to individuals suffering from Ground Zero illness (physical ailments from the dust from the attacks) or mental health problems as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks.
This Medicare proposal includes a section that provides for a consortium of organization to study Ground Zero illness.[24]
According to the National Journal, Nadler is one of seven members of the House of Representatives who tie for most liberal.[25]
Nadler lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his wife and son.
In 2002 and 2003 Nadler had laparoscopic duodenal switch surgery, helping him lose more than 100 pounds.[26][27][28]"
"268","","1993","1948","New York 12","Greensboro College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Maloney","Carolyn Maloney","Democratic","New York City Councilwoman","Presbyterian PC(USA)","Carolyn Jane Maloney[1] (ne Bosher; born February 19, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for New York's 12th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party.


Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, the daughter of Christine Elizabeth (ne Clegg) and Ralph George Bosher.[2] She attended Greensboro College. After graduating, she visited New York City in 1970 and decided to stay.[3]
For several years, she worked as a teacher and an administrator for the New York City Board of Education.[4] In 1977, she obtained a job working for the New York State Legislature and held senior staff positions in both the State Assembly and the State Senate.[4] Maloney was the first woman to represent New York City's 7th Council district (where she was the first woman to give birth while in office); and was the first woman to chair the Joint Economic Committee, a House and Senate panel that examines and addresses the nation's most pressing economic issues.[5] Nicholas Kristof said of her work in the battle against human trafficking: ""No one has been a greater champion than Carolyn Maloney"" in the fight against human trafficking.[6] Her question: ""Where are the women?"", asked at a hearing by the Government Oversight Committee created a minor controversy in 2012.
Maloney was elected to the New York City Council in 1982, defeating incumbent Robert Rodriguez [7] in a heavily Spanish-speaking district based in East Harlem and parts of the South Bronx. She served as a Councilmember for 10 years.[8] On the council, she served as the first Chair of the Committee on Contracts, investigating contracts issued by New York City in sludge and other areas. She authored legislation creating the City's Vendex program, which established computerized systems tracking information on City contracts and vendors doing business with the City.[9] Maloney also introduced the first measure in New York to recognize domestic partnerships, including those of same-sex couples.[10] She was the first person to give birth while serving as a City Councilmember, and the first to offer a comprehensive package of legislation to make day care more available and affordable.[4]
For the 2013 legislative session, Govtrack.us scored Maloney 3rd among House Democrats for ""Leadership,"" 3rd among all representatives for ""Powerful Co-sponsors,"" 3rd highest in the New York delegation for ""Working with the Senate,"" and 5th highest among all representatives for ""Bills Sponsored."" [11]
In 2011, a Daily News survey found that Rep. Maloney ranks first among New York's 28 representatives for activity with 36 proposed bills, resolutions and amendments. [12]
Politically, Maloney is ranked in the National Journal's annual ranking as the 114th most liberal (or 314th most conservative) member of Congress, with more liberal scores on foreign policy than on economic and social policy. Her score of 75.5 ranks her as modestly more liberal than the New York Congressional delegation as a whole.[13]
In the midst of the 2014 election cycle, the New York Daily News ran a story that noted ""Maloney has proposed more legislation than any other House member, according to records."" and calling her ""James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, giving compensation to Ground Zero workers who have fallen ill, as big a bill for the New York area as any in the last decade."" [14]
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Maloney worked to ensure that the Bush administration maintained its commitment to New York's recovery and security efforts, prompting Wayne Barrett of the Village Voice to write that Maloney was ""like a tiger in the House on every dollar due New York."" [15]
After the 9/11 Commission published its findings, Maloney co-founded the bipartisan House 9/11 Commission Caucus [16] and helped write and secure the enactment into law of many of its recommendations to reform the nation's intelligence agencies [17][18] Congressional Quarterly wrote in its annual guide, 2006 Politics in America: ""In the 108th Congress, Maloney reached out beyond her usual roles as a liberal gadfly and persistent Bush administration critic, helping win enactment of a sweeping bill to reorganize U.S. intelligence operations.""[19]
Following the Dubai Ports World controversy, Maloney helped secure the passage and enactment of her bill to reform the system for vetting foreign investments in the United States.[20][21] Maloney has supported Scientology's ""New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project"".[22]
In response to a number of high-profile incidents of gun violence, Congresswoman Maloney sponsored two bills to address the issue. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013 would make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time and substantially stiffen the penalties for ""straw buyers"" who knowingly help convicted felons, domestic abusers, the violently mentally ill and others, obtain guns.[23] A second bill would require gun owners to maintain liability insurance, just as most car owners must do. Maloney received death threats over the insurance bill.[24]
In 2014, she joined with Senator Ed Markey in sending a letter to President Barack Obama asking him to insert $10 million into the budget for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to resume research on gun violence and conduct scientific research on the causes and prevention of gun violence.[25]
After reports of corruption among military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, Maloney later secured House passage of her bill to create a database to better monitor all federal contracts, the key provisions of which were later adopted into law as part of the defense budget.[26][27]
Maloney has taken several actions on health care issues. Her measure to provide Medicare coverage for annual mammograms was included in the Fiscal Year 1998 federal budget.[28]
She was a leading advocate for the cause of providing federal support for medical monitoring and health care for rescue and recovery workers who were exposed to toxic smoke and dust at the Ground Zero site after the 9/11 attacks.[29] Maloney authored the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act and led the fight for years to push for its passage. In 2010 President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. It provides $4.3 billion in federal funds to provide 9/11 responders and survivors with treatment and compensation for their injuries. In June 2012, it was announced that the program would be expanded to cover care for a variety of cancers of the lung, trachea, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, bladder, kidney, thyroid and breast.[30]
In the 111th Congress, Maloney introduced ""The Breastfeeding Promotion Act"" to protect breastfeeding in the workplace under civil rights law and make it illegal for women to lose their jobs or otherwise be discriminated against for expressing milk during lunchtime or on breaks.[31] Maloney has advocated for international women's health and family planning programs supported by the United Nations Population Fund.[32]
A co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Working Group on Parkinson's Disease,[33] she serves on the boards of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Research Foundation[34] and the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation,[35] both in New York City.
Responding to the concerns of many parents, Maloney introduced the Comprehensive Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of 2007 (H.R. 2832), legislation that would require the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct a comprehensive comparative study of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, in support of the spurious claims asserting a link between autism and vaccine components, including thimerosal and aluminum.[36] The original bill did not pass, but Maloney re-introduced the legislation in 2008. Maloney introduced similar legislation with Representative Bill Posey in 2013 to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct or support a study comparing total health outcomes, including risk of autism, between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.[37]
Maloney serves on the Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Joint Economic Committee, and was previously the Chair of the Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security. From January 2009 to January 2011, Maloney served as Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, the first woman to do so. Maloney first introduced the ""Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights"" or (the Credit CARD Act of 2009) while serving as Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, in the 110th Congress. The measure drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates.[38][39] It was passed as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act by both houses of the 111th Congress, prompting Money magazine to dub Maloney the ""best friend a credit card user ever had.""[40] President Barack Obama signed the Credit Card Bill of Rights into law in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House attended by Maloney on May 22, 2009.[41]
Days after voting against cancellation of a $1 billion, 10-year subsidy plan for U.S. sugar farmers within the 2007 U.S. Farm Bill, Maloney hosted a fundraising event that netted $9,500 in contributions from sugar growers and refiners, according to Federal Election Commission records. Maloney's election attorney, Andrew Tulloch, called the timing of the July 31 fundraiser a ""pure coincidence."" The bill passed the House by a 282-144 vote.[42] The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maloney has the ninth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[43] Maloney received a perfect 100 rating from the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund in 2007,[44] a perfect 100 rating from Environment America in 2008[44] and a perfect 100 from the League of Conservation Voters in Feb. of 2008.[45] And in 2008, Maloney introduced the Minerals Management Service Improvement Act (HR 7211) as a House companion to Integrity in Offshore Energy Resources Act (S. 3543). The legislation would impose dramatically tougher ethics rules for the Minerals Management Service, which was at the center of a major corruption scandal stemming from its employees' relationships with oil company representatives.[46]
Maloney has been active on issues involving women, children and families since the beginning of her career.[8] A former Co-Chair of the House Caucus on Women's Issues, she authored and helped secure the enactment into law of a measure to provide federal funding to clear the backlog of rape kits for which evidence had been collected, but never entered into law enforcement DNA databases. It was called ""the most important anti-rape legislation ever considered by Congress"" by the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network.[47] Maloney's bill, included in the ""Justice for All Act of 2005"", was named the Debbie Smith Act in honor of Debbie Smith, a rape survivor. The effort to enact the bill was later the subject of a Lifetime Television movie, A Life Interrupted: The Debbie Smith Story,[48] in which Maloney was played by Lynne Adams. Maloney also co-authored and helped secure passage of bipartisan legislation to curb the demand for sex trafficking.[49] In April 2014, Maloney argued strongly in favor of the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4323; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act. The bill would reauthorize funding through Fiscal Year 2019 for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, sexual assault forensic exam program grants, and DNA training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel and court officers.[50] The bill would authorize the appropriation of $968 million over the 2015-2019 period.[51] The grant program would go to the states to run programs to analyze DNA samples from crime victims.[52] Maloney argued that ""this is one of those rare bills that virtually guarantees that it will put real criminals behind bars and protect people more effectively against one of the most traumatic assaults imaginable.""[53]
She introduced the Child Care Affordability Act of 2007 to increase access to child care by providing tax credits.[54] Maloney's amendment to a foreign aid bill succeeded in securing $60 million in funding for programs for Afghan women and girls and to help establish an Afghan commission on human rights.[55] She is the chief House sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment.[56] In 2008 and again in 2009, Maloney authored, and secured House passage of, a bill to provide four weeks of paid parental leave to federal employees.[57][58]
She has also authored and introduced the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act that would expand the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act to include couples in domestic partnerships, civil unions, and same-sex marriages.[59] Legislation to create a National Women's History Museum that was jointly introduced by Maloney and her colleague Eleanor Holmes Norton was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in October, 2009.[60]
In 2011, she sponsored the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, known as the Campus SaVE Act. It became part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. The measure guarantees counseling, legal assistance, and medical care on campuses for victims of sexual assault, establishes minimum, national standards for schools to follow in responding to allegations of sexual assault and sexual violence, and makes it explicit that schools must provide to both the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim the same rights, including access to advisers, written notifications, as well as appeals processes during campus disciplinary proceedings.[61]
On February 27, 2013, Maloney introduced the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Womens History Museum Act of 2013 (H.R. 863; 113th Congress) into the House.[62] The bill would establish a commission to prepare a report containing recommendations for establishing and maintaining a National Womens History Museum in Washington, D.C..[63] The 8-member commission would have 18 months to produce the report and submit it to the Congress.[63] Maloney argued that ""the museums and memorials in our nations Capitol demonstrate what we value. We have museums dedicated to flight, postage stamps, law enforcement and many other important people and issues of interest, but not to women. This bill would provide women, comprising 53% of our population, a long overdue home on our National Mall to honor their many contributions that are the very fabric of our country.""[64]
Maloney is the co-chair and co-founder of the Human Trafficking Caucus.[6] She has authored numerous bills to combat human trafficking and sex trafficking, including: The Prevention of Trafficking of Tsunami Orphans Act of 2005;[65] The End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005;[66] The Human Trafficking Fraud Enforcement Act of 2010;[67] The Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2010;[68] The International Women's Freedom Act of 2011.[69] In 2012 Maloney joined forces with Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn in a letter to Google questioning how the company's advertising practices addresses human trafficking. Explaining her concerns, Maloney stated that: ""100,000 children in the United Statesmost of whom are American citizensare exploited through commercial sex every year, with the average age of first exploitation between 12-13 years old."" [70]
In Congress, Maloney has helped secure funding for major mass transit projects, resulting in the commitment of billions of federal dollars for New York State.[71] Early in her tenure, she joined with colleagues to secure $306.1 million in federal funds for the 63rd Street Connector, a $645 million project that significantly expanded transit capacity between Queens and Manhattan [72] Maloney has been hailed as a champion of the Second Avenue Subway,[73] a project first conceived in the 1920s. In November 2007, the federal government signed a full funding grant agreement with New York State committing to providing $1.3 billion in federal funds for the subway's first phase on Manhattan's Upper East Side.[74] Maloney has also advocated for the East Side Access project, which will bring Long Island Railroad (LIRR) trains directly to Grand Central Terminal and create a new LIRR stop in Sunnyside, Queens. In December 2006, the federal government signed a full funding grant agreement promising $2.63 billion to New York to complete East Side Access.[75]
Maloney co-sponsored the 2009 reintroduction of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act (H.R. 801, originally introduced as H.R. 6845 in 2008) as well as the Research Works Act (H.R. 3699) introduced in 2011. Both bills aim to reverse the NIH's Public Access Policy,[76] which mandates open access to NIH-funded research.[77] The Association of American Publishers-backed Research Works Act was criticized by some scientists. In a New York Times op-ed, Michael Eisen described how the bill would force the public to pay $15$30 per paper to read the results of research they had already paid for as taxpayers.[78] (Such results must now be published in Pubmed Central (PMC) after an embargo period of up to 12 months: this embargo period was imposed to minimize financial harm to publishers who were concerned that their readership would diminish if the results appeared concurrently in PMC, though authors of the paper are required to submit their papers to PMC as soon as their paper gets accepted for publication by a peer-review journal.) Some have suggested that Maloney supports the measure because she is the recipient of campaign contributions from Elsevier, the largest scholarly publishing company.[78][79] On February 27, 2012, following a boycott of the organization, In a letter to constituents, Maloney noted that ""it is important to be mindful of the impact of various industries on job creation and retention. New York State is home to more than 300 publishers that employ more than 12,000 New Yorkers, many of whom live in or around New York City in my district. New York City scientific publishers represent a significant subset of the total, and more than 20 are located in Manhattan, publishing thousands of scientific journals and employing thousands of New Yorkers."" [80] Elsevier withdrew their support for the legislation.[81][82]
In 2010, the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Maloney with its Good Government Award for her contributions to government transparency and oversight, including her investigations into corruption and mismanagement in the Minerals Management Service and her support of a Federal Contractor Misconduct Database similar to POGO's.[83]
Book and notable television appearances:
In 2008, Rodale Press published Maloney's book on women's issues, Rumors of Our Progress Have Been Greatly Exaggerated: Why Women's Lives Aren't Getting Any Easierand How We Can Make Real Progress for Ourselves and Our Daughters.[84] In the book, Maloney argues that progress for women has stalled and offers recommendations for resuming their advance toward full equality.[85]
Maloney appeared on The Colbert Report in the Better Know a District segment on July 29, 2008, speaking about women's issues.
In 2012, a clip of Maloney asking ""Where are the women?"" created a bit of a firestorm. She asked the question of an all-male panel at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The panel had been called by the Republican members of the Committee to testify on the issue of birth control and new health care reform regulations. In her opening statement, Maloney said: ""Where are the women? When I look at this panel, I don't see one single woman representing the tens of millions of women across the country who want and need insurance coverage for basic, preventative health care services, including family planning,"" Maloney continued. Then she repeated: ""Where are the women?"" The clip and a photo of the all male panel quickly went viral and became a rallying cry for women's groups. Women's issues and their reproductive rights took on great significance during the 2012 Presidential campaign.[86]
In 1992, Maloney was elected to the House of Representatives, narrowly defeating 15-year incumbent Bill Green, a progressive Republican, to become the second woman to ever represent the district after Susan Molinari. The 14th and its predecessors had been one of the few districts in the city where Republicans usually did well; in fact, they held the seat for all but eight of the 56 years between 1937 and Maloney's victory. Although the district had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting, Maloney's win is still considered an upset.
Following Maloney's win, Republicans continued to hold most of the State Senate, Assembly, and City Council seats on Manhattan's East Side for nearly another decade. Since 2002, the Democrats have dominated the area, and now hold all of the area's seats in the state legislature and City Council.[87]
Maloney faced significant opposition from Republican City Councilman Charles Millard in 1994, the year of a Republican tidal wave in the midterm congressional elections. She defeated Millard handily, taking 64 percent of the vote.[88] She has not faced credible opposition since, and has been reelected eight more times by an average of 77 percent of the vote.
In 2004, Maloney faced a potential Democratic primary challenge from Robert Jereski, a former Green Party political candidate and unsuccessful candidate for delegate to the 2004 Democratic National Convention on the slate of Dennis Kucinich. Jereski opposed the Iraq War while Maloney had initially voted for the resolution to authorize force; she later forcefully renounced the war, including most memorably at a town hall meeting in her district [89] with antiwar Congressman John Murtha. However, Jereski didn't qualify for the ballot because his petition was found to have invalid signatures, leaving him 4 short of the 1250 required.
In December 2008, Maloney hired a public-relations firm to help bolster her efforts to be named by Governor David Paterson as Hillary Clinton's successor as a New York Senator. Maloney toured parts of the state, but was overshadowed by Caroline Kennedy's promotional tour for the same seat. Maloney interviewed with the governor for 55 minutes. Public opinion polls placed Maloney's support for the Senate seat in the single digits, trailing the front-runner, then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, although her bid was endorsed by the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee, the Feminist Majority Political Action Committee,[90] New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof,[91] and other columnists [92] and editorial boards.[93]
On January 23, 2009, Paterson named Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to the post.[94] Many urged Maloney to run against Gillibrand in 2010.[95][96]
Although she had been leading Gillibrand in both the Rasmussen[97] and the Quinnipiac polls,[98] Maloney ruled out a run for the U.S.Senate and instead retained her congressional seat.[99]
In the Democratic Primary for Congress on September 14, 2010, Maloney defeated a well-funded opponent, Reshma Saujani, a 34-year-old Indian-American hedge fund lawyer, by a landslide, 62-percentage point margin, racking up more than 81% of the vote to Saujani's 19 percent. Her success was due in large part to a substantial grassroots effort, with volunteers and a motivated field team reaching out to registered voters across the district.[100] That night, Saujani said, ""I'm definitely running again"",[101] but three months later announced publicly that she would not challenge Maloney again.[102]
In 2012 Maloney's Republican challenger was Christopher Wright, who took a leave of absence from J. P. Morgan to campaign. Maloney won with 80.9% of the total and by a margin of over 120,000 votes.[103]
In 2014 she was challenged by Republican Nicholas Di Iorio who was a ""financial contractor with Pfizer.""[104] Maloney won with 80% of the vote. [105]
When Maloney proposed her Credit Card Holders Bill of Rights, she was widely criticized by Credit Card Issuers. Among the many claims that were leveled against the bill: ""credit cards would be more difficult to get, limits would be lower, and interest rates would be higher for everyone.""[106] However a study by the Pew Foundation two years after the bills passage found that: ""Credit card holders are seeing stabilized interest rates, the elimination of overlimit penalty charges, a reduction in late fees charged by banks and minimal changes in annual fees since the Credit CARD Act of 2009 took effect.""[107]
A 2013 study by the Social Science Research Network found that the CARD Act may have saved credit cardholders over $20 billion annually since its implementation and that there was no evidence of an increase in interest charges or reduction in access to credit.[108]
On July 20, 2009, Maloney apologized after using the word ""nigger"" in repeating a critical comment made by a third party about Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.[109] Maloney was quoted by the City Hall News:[110]
I got a call from someone from Puerto Rico, [who] said Gillibrand went to Puerto Rico and came out for English-only (education). And he said, 'it was like saying nigger to a Puerto Rican'.

She married Clifton Maloney, an investment banker, in 1976. The couple had two daughters, Christina and Virginia. Her husband, the oldest American ever to summit an ""eight-thousander"",[111] the world's fourteen mountains that surpass 8,000 meters in altitude, died on a climbing expedition on September 25, 2009, while descending from the world's sixth tallest peak, Cho Oyu in Tibet.[112][113] Before retiring to his tent for some sleep, Mr. Maloney's last words were reportedly: 'I am the happiest man in the world. I just climbed a beautiful mountain.""[114]
Maloney is a member of The Junior League of the City of New York.

A member of the Democratic Party, he is the second-longest currently serving member of the House of Representatives, serving continuously since 1971. As its most senior member, he is also the Dean of New York's congressional delegation. Rangel was the first African-American Chair of the influential House Ways and Means Committee. He is also a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Rangel was born in Harlem in New York City. He earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, where he led a group of soldiers out of a deadly Chinese army encirclement during the Battle of Kunu-ri in 1950. Rangel graduated from New York University in 1957 and St. John's University School of Law in 1960. He then worked as a private lawyer, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and legal counsel during the early-mid-1960s. He served two terms in the New York State Assembly, from 1967 to 1971, and then defeated long-time incumbent Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in a primary challenge on his way to being elected to the House of Representatives.
Once there, Rangel rose rapidly in the Democratic ranks, combining solidly liberal views with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. His long-time concerns with battling the importation and effects of illegal drugs led to his becoming chair of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, where he helped define national policy on the issue during the 1980s. As one of Harlem's ""Gang of Four"", he also became a leader in New York City and State politics. He played a significant role in the creation of the 1995 Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation and the national Empowerment Zone Act, which helped change the economic face of Harlem and other inner-city areas. Rangel is known both for his genial manner, with an ability to win over fellow legislators, and for his blunt speaking; he has long been outspoken about his views and has been arrested several times as part of political demonstrations. He was a strong opponent of the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War, and he put forth proposals to reinstate the draft during the 2000s.
Beginning in 2008, Rangel faced a series of allegations of ethics violations and failures to comply with tax laws. The House Ethics Committee focused on whether Rangel improperly rented multiple rent-stabilized New York apartments, improperly used his office in raising money for the Rangel Center at the City College of New York, and failed to disclose rental income from his villa in the Dominican Republic. In March 2010, Rangel stepped aside as Ways and Means Chair. In November 2010, the Ethics Committee found Rangel guilty of 11 counts of violating House ethics rules, and on December 2, 2010, the full House approved a sanction of censure against him. Rangel has since faced two strong primary challenges in a now primarily Hispanic district but has prevailed. He has stated that his current term will be his last.
Rangel was born in Harlem in New York City on June 11, 1930.[4] His father, Ralph Rangel, was from Puerto Rico and came to New York in 1914, while his African American mother, Blanche Mary Wharton Rangel, was from Virginia.[5][nb 1] Charles was the second of three children,[4] with an older brother Ralph Jr. and a younger sister Frances.[5] Ralph Rangel sometimes worked as a laborer in a garage,[5] but he was mostly a frequently absent, unemployed man who was abusive to his wife and who left the family when Charles was six years old.[4][6] Charles was raised by his mother, who worked as a maid and as a seamstress in a factory in New York's Garment District, and by his maternal grandfather.[6][7] Many summers were spent in Accomac, Virginia, where his maternal family had roots.[8] Charles was brought up as a Roman Catholic.[9]
Rangel did well in elementary and middle school,[4] and began working at a neighborhood drug store at the age of eight.[6] Rangel then attended DeWitt Clinton High School,[7] but was often truant and was sometimes driven home by the police.[6] His maternal grandfather, an early role model who worked in a courthouse and knew many judges and lawyers, kept him from getting into more serious trouble.[6] Rangel dropped out at age 16 during his junior year and worked in various low-paying jobs, including selling shoes.[6][7][10]
Rangel then enlisted in the United States Army, and served from 1948 to 1952.[11] During the Korean War, he was an artillery operations specialist in the all-black 503rd Field Artillery Battalion in the 2nd Infantry Division,[12][13] equipped with the 155 mm Howitzer M1.[14] (While President Harry S. Truman had signed the order to desegregate the military in 1948, little progress in doing so had been made during peacetime, and the large majority of units initially sent to Korea were still segregated.[15]) Rangel's unit arrived in Pusan, South Korea, in August 1950 and then began moving north as U.N. forces advanced deep into North Korea.[13]
In late November 1950, after the Chinese intervention into the war, this unit was caught up in heavy fighting in North Korea as part of the U.N. forces retreat from the Yalu River. In the Battle of Kunu-ri, the 2nd Infantry was assigned to hold a road position near Kunu-ri while the rest of the Eighth Army retreated to Sunchon, 21 miles further south. On the night of November 29, 1950, the 2nd Infantry was attacked by gradually encircling forces of the Chinese Army, who set up a fireblock to cut off any U.S. retreat. The eerie blare of Chinese night-fighting bugle calls and communication flares[16] piercing the freezing air led to what Rangel later described as a ""waking nightmare, scene by scene, and we couldn't see any possible way out of the situation.""[17] During the day of November 30, the order came to withdraw the 2nd Infantry in phases, but the 503rd Artillery Battalion was sixth of eight in the order and could not get out in daylight when air cover was possible.[18]
On the night of November 30, Rangel was part of a retreating vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces.[12][19] In the subzero cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell.[20] He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus.[19] Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men.[21] There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner,[11] but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: ""From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better on the other side of that damn mountain.""[19]
Others nearby looked to Rangel, who though only a private first class had a reputation for leadership in the unit and had gained the nickname ""Sarge"".[19] Rangel led some 40 men from his unit over the mountain during the night and out of the Chinese encirclement.[11] Other groups were trying to do the same, but some men dropped from the severe conditions or got lost and were never heard from again.[22][23] By midday on December 1, U.S. aircraft were dropping supplies and directions to Rangel's group and others, and had a raft ready to take them across the Taedong River; groups from the 503rd Artillery reached Sunchon that afternoon.[22][24] Overall, no part of the 2nd Infantry suffered as many casualties as the artillery;[25] it tried to save, but eventually lost, all its guns,[26] and nearly half of the battalion was killed in the overall battle.[27]
Rangel was treated first at a field hospital, then moved to a general hospital well behind the lines in South Korea where he recuperated.[28] He eventually returned to regular duty, then was rotated back to the U.S. in July 1951.[28]
Rangel was awarded a Purple Heart for his wounds, the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions in the face of death, and three battle stars.[29] His Army unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation[nb 2] and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.[29] In 2000, Rangel reflected to CBS News that
""Since Kunu Ri  and I mean it with all my heart, I have never, never had a bad day.""[12]
After an honorable discharge from the Army in 1952 with the rank of staff sergeant,[11] he returned home to headlines in The New York Amsterdam News.[6] Rangel later viewed his time in the Army, away from the poverty of his youth, as a major turning point in his life: ""When I was exposed to a different life, even if that life was just the Army, I knew damn well I couldn't get back to the same life I had left.""[30]
Rangel finished high school, completing two years of studies in one year and graduating in 1953.[7] Rangel then received a Bachelor of Science degree from the New York University School of Commerce in 1957, where he made the dean's list.[11] Then, on full scholarship, he obtained his law degree from the St. John's University School of Law in 1960.[31]
Rangel is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is also a member of the fraternity's World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand Alpha Phi Alpha's involvement in politics and social and current policy to encompass international concerns.[32]
After finishing law school, Rangel passed the state bar exam and was hired by Weaver, Evans & Wingate, a prominent black law firm.[33] Rangel made little money in private practice, but did build a positive reputation for providing legal assistance to black civil rights activists.[7] In 1961, Rangel was appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York by U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy,[7] working under U.S. Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau. He stayed in that position for a year.[7]
Following that, Rangel was legal counsel to the New York Housing and Redevelopment Board,[34] associate counsel to the Speaker of the New York State Assembly,[34] a law clerk to pioneering Judge James L. Watson,[35] and general counsel to the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service (1966), a presidential commission to revise draft laws.[36][37] His interest in politics grew with these roles.[38]
Rangel met Alma Carter, a social worker, in the mid-late-1950s while on the dance floor of the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem.[6] They married on July 26, 1964.[38] They have two children, Steven and Alicia, and three grandsons.[38]
He ran but lost for party district leader during an intense Democratic factional dispute in Harlem in 1963.[39] In 1964, Rangel and the man who would become his political mentor, Assemblyman Percy Sutton, merged clubs as part of forming the John F. Kennedy Democratic Club in Harlem (which later became part of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Democratic Club).[7][34][40]
Rangel participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, marching for four days even though he had planned only a brief appearance.[11] He developed what The New York Times would label his irrepressible energy and joking self-mockery during this period.[11]
Rangel was selected in September 1966 by Harlem Democrats to run in the 72nd District for the New York State Assembly, after the incumbent Percy Sutton had been elected by the New York City Council members from Manhattan as Manhattan Borough President to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Constance Baker Motley as a federal judge.[41] Rangel was victorious, and served in the 177th and 178th New York State Legislatures until 1970.[7] He emerged as a leader among the black legislators in the state, and also became politically friendly with Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller, who arranged for Rangel to run on the Republican as well as Democratic ballot line during his 1968 re-election.[7]
Rangel supported legalization of the numbers game, saying ""For the average Harlemite, playing numbers ... is moral and a way of life.""[11] He also opposed harsher penalties on prostitutes, on grounds of ineffectiveness.[11] He was strongly concerned by the effects of drugs on Harlem, advocated that drug pushers be held accountable for the crimes committed by their users, and in general believed the problem was at the level of a threat to national security.[42][43]
In 1969, Rangel ran for the Democratic nomination for New York City Council President. In a tumultuous race that featured sportswriter Jimmy Breslin as mayoral candidate Norman Mailer's running mate, Rangel came in last in a field of six candidates.[44]
In 1970, Rangel ran for election to the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging long-time incumbent Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., in the Democratic primary in New York's 18th congressional district.[7] Powell had been an iconic, charismatic, and flamboyant figure[4][7] who had become embroiled in an ethics controversy in 1967, lost his seat, then regained it in 1969 due to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Powell v. McCormack.[45] In a field of five candidates, Rangel focused on criticizing Powell's frequent absences from Congress.[4] In the June primary, Rangel defeated Powell by 150votes out of around 25,000.[7] Powell tried to take legal action to overturn the result, claiming over 1,000 ballots were improper,[43] but was unsuccessful. Powell also failed to get on the ballot as an independent. With both Democratic and Republican backing, Rangel won the November 1970 general electionagainst a Liberal Party candidate and several otherswith 88percent of the vote.[7]
As of 2015[update], Rangel is the second-longest currently serving House member, behind only John Conyers.
Initially the strongest electoral challenge to Rangel came during his first re-election bid, in 1972, when he faced a Democratic primary challenge from HARYOU-ACT director Livingston Wingate, who had the backing of the old Powell organization and the Congress of Racial Equality, a black nationalist group that Rangel publicly denounced.[7] Rangel had the backing of the other Democratic power bases, however, and won the primary by a 3to1 margin[46] and the general election easily.
Rangel has won re-election every two years since, usually with over 90percent of the vote and often with over 95percent.[47][48][49] In a number of elections, Rangel has received the backing of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Liberal Party of New York.[46] Rangel's consistent appeal to his constituents has been due to the perception of him as a champion for justice not just in Harlem but elsewhere in the world.[50] He did face a mid-career primary challenge in 1994, when two-term New York City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell IV ran and held Rangel to 58 percent of the vote.[51] Rangel then faced strong primary challenges from 2010 on during and after his ethics troubles.
His district was numbered the Eighteenth District from 1971 to 1973; the Nineteenth District from 1973 to 1983; the Sixteenth District from 1983 to 1993; and the Fifteenth from 1993 to 2013. Early 1970s reapportionment led to the area Rangel represented being only 65 percent black,[46] and by 1979 it was 50 percent black, 30 percent white, and 20 percent Puerto Rican.[52] By 2000, only 3 in 10 district residents were black, while nearly half were Hispanic, with many of the newcomers Dominican.[53] Presently numbered the Thirteenth, Rangel's area of representation shows a 2-to-1 preponderance of Hispanics over African Americans.[54]
Rangel was an original member when the Congressional Black Caucus was formed in 1971.[55] In 1974 he was elected its chairman[4][46] and he served in that role until 1976.[56] He has remained a member of the caucus ever since.
As a freshman representative, Rangel focused on the drug issue, and was a member of the House Select Committee on Crime. In February 1971, he criticized the Nixon administration for not taking stronger action against Turkey and France, the source and manufacture points for most of the heroin coming into the U.S.[7] His proposal to halt foreign aid to countries not cooperating in the effort against international drug trafficking was unsuccessful, but did lead to a bill that authorized the president to reduce aid to such countries.[7] Rangel created controversy in New York City by accusing some members of the New York Police Department of cooperating with drug pushers.[7]
On April 14, 1972, Rangel and Louis Farrakhan intervened in the investigation of the murder of New York Police Department patrolman Philip Cardillo, who was fatally shot in a Harlem Nation of Islam mosque where Malcolm X used to preach. Before a suspect could be taken into custody, Farrakhan and Rangel arrived at the scene, saying that a riot would likely occur if the suspect and others were not released.[59] Some police officials also limited the investigation, including deputy commissioner for public affairs Benjamin Ward, who had ordered all white police officers away from the scene in acquiescing to the demands of Farrakhan and Rangel.[59]
Despite an initial impression that Rangel was mostly concerned with the ""ghetto problems"" of drugs and welfare, Rangel focused on many other issues as well.[52] He was a consistent backer of Israel, including objecting to an anti-Israeli resolution adopted at the National Black Political Convention in 1972[60] and urging black Americans to support the civil rights of Soviet Jews in 1975.[61] In other respects, Rangel opposed foreign interventions and military spending, voting against bombing in Cambodia and against funding for the B-1 bomber and supercarriers.[46]
In Congress, one of Rangel's first committee assignments was on the House Judiciary Committee, where during the Watergate scandal he participated in the 1974 impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon. Rangel received both national attention and respect for his well-informed questioning style during the hearings.[4][37][46] Rangel was also prominent in questioning Governor Rockefeller on his role in handling the Attica Prison riot during Rockefeller's vice presidential confirmation hearing.[4]
Rangel rose rapidly in the House, due to his political skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner.[46] In 1974, he became the first black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means,[4][52] a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee),[51] and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health.[46] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.[46] By 1979, Rangel was a member of the influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.[46] Rangel combined his solidly liberal viewsinterest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegationwith a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises.[46][52] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration.[52] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem.[52] Rangel said of himself, ""I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself.""[52]
Besides his increasing influence in Washington, by the late 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure.[52] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off.[62] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. As Koch related, ""He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I want you to know he's nasty to everybody.' I thought that was rather nice.""[52]
In 1981, Rangel shifted to become chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, which gave him power in dealing with the Reagan administration's cuts in social spending.[46] By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, Dan Rostenkowski.[46] Rangel also became a protg of Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, who made him Deputy Majority Whip that same year.[46][63] In the United States presidential election, 1984, Rangel supported former Vice President Walter Mondale, rather than the primary campaign of Jesse Jackson.
By now, Rangel was known as one of the ""Gang of Four"", who along with his old mentor Percy Sutton, city and state figure Basil Paterson, and future mayor David Dinkins, were the most prominent politicians in Harlem.[64][65] They broke racial barriers, attained offices once viewed as not possible for black Americans to achieve, and paved the way for many others around the nation.[65] As power brokers they would dominate public life in Harlem for a generation.[66]
Rangel endorsed Koch for re-election in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down:[62] ""I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he sit down with the mayor.""[67] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State.[68] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless.[46][62] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians,[66] and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker.[62] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.[51]
In 1983, Rangel became chair of the Select Committee on Narcotics, which solidified his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him.[46][63][69][70] Rangel kept the committee going, in the face of the usual pressure to disband special committees.[63] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless.[37] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.[37] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel ""a front-line general in the war against drugs.""[71] Rangel said ""We need outrage!"", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s.[71] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent ""moral and political suicide"".[71] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu.[6] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's ""Just Say No"" campaign had been quite valuable.[72] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. The Washington Post said Rangel was ""in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda.""[70] He would remain as chair of the committee through 1993,[69] when it was abolished along with other House select committees.[53]
Rangel was part of the HouseSenate joint conference that worked on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a simplifying overhaul that constituted the most sweeping reform of the U.S. tax code in 50 years.[63] In the negotiations, Rangel successfully argued for dropping more lower-income people from the tax rolls;[63] the elimination of six million households from federal income taxation was hailed as wise policy by both liberal and conservative groups.[73] Rangel authored the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit portion of the bill, which increased affordable housing in the U.S.[38] He also played a key role in preserving the deductibility of state and local income taxes.[53] Rangel asserted that while beneficiaries of tax reform were not well organized, business interests opposed to it were. When the conference threatened to break down, he stressed that it was vital to reach an agreement.[74]
By late 1985, Rangel was in a six-person race to become the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked position in the House and for the first time up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker.[75] By October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance.[63][76] However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 16778.[77] Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,[75][78] later saying, I had never been so goddamn naive. I came to Washington as an experienced politician. How did I miss Coelhos contribution to members?[78]
In December 1984, Rangel was arrested for participating in an anti-apartheid rally in front of the South African Consulate in New York.[79] Rangel successfully pushed to have foreign tax credits removed for corporations doing business in that country, a 1987 act that became known as the ""Rangel Amendment"".[38][80][81] A number of companies left South Africa as a result, and the amendment proved to be one of the more effective anti-apartheid sanctions.[53][81] It subsequently won praise from Nelson Mandela, and Rangel later said was one of his actions that he was most proud of.[80]
During the 1991 Gulf War, Rangel demanded that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell investigate allegations of discrimination from black members of the New York Army National Guard regarding combat training and treatment. During the Clinton administration, Rangel did battle with executive branch officials over budget items almost as much as he had during Republican administrations,[80] and always resented when Clinton negotiated directly with Republicans while bypassing congressional Democrats.[82] In 1993, however, Rangel was a key sponsor of increases to the Earned Income Tax Credit that passed.[53]
Rangel's dream of becoming chairman of Ways and Means took a tumble with the Republican Revolution of 1994, which took control of the House away from the Democrats for the first time in decades. He did become the ranking Democrat of the committee in 1996.[51] Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican Contract With America, considering it an assault on America's poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and religious leaders such as John Cardinal O'Connor for perpetuating ""the silence of good people"" that he likened to what happened in Nazi Germany.[6] When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair Bill Archer in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings.[82] Rangel also strongly opposed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty.[83]
Opening up economic opportunities for minorities and the poor was a focus of Rangel's during the 1990s.[38] His 1993 legislation created ""empowerment zones"", which provided tax incentives for investment and job creation in inner urban areas;[38] it would eventually account for $5 billion in federal spending across the nation's cities.[50][66] Rangel played a specific role in the creation of the 1995 Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which led to a $500 million spending of public and private monies towards changing the face of Harlem, including gentrification effects.[51] Rangel served on the corporation's board, and the effort was credited with helping the resurgence of Harlem that took place during the 1990s.[49][66]
In late 1998, when long-time Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York announced his retirement, Rangel was one of the first to advocate that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton move to New York and run for the seat.[84] She did so, successfully. During the late 1990s, Rangel led an outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that sought to gain African American votes for white candidates in key swing districts.[85] The project may have helped gain or keep several seats during the 1998 mid-term House elections.[85]
On March 15, 1999, the Congressman was arrested along with two other prominent African-American leaders (civil rights activist Al Sharpton and former Mayor David Dinkins), for protesting the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant to the United States from Guinea, by four white and Hispanic New York City police officers.[86] The involved officers were later acquitted by a mixed-race jury.
In October 1998, New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed a lawsuit charging the directors of the foundation behind New York's Apollo Theater, including foundation chair Rangel, with failing to collect more than $4 million owed it by a company controlled by Percy Sutton that produced the television program It's Showtime at the Apollo.[87][88] The suit sought the removal of Rangel; after months of indecision, Rangel stepped down as chair but remained on the board.[89] In October 1999, new Attorney General Eliot Spitzer dismissed the lawsuit and cleared Rangel and Sutton of any wrongdoing, saying that all monies properly owed had changed hands.[88][89] Rangel expressed bitterness over the year-long episode, saying ""I shouldn't have had to go through this.""[89]
During the early 2000s (decade) Rangel advocated continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant. Rangel also had an unproductive relationship with Ways and Means chairman Bill Thomas, leading to an incident where Thomas called the United States Capitol Police on Rangel for having his members read a bill in the library, an action Thomas apologized for.[51][82]
Rangel sponsored the African Growth and Opportunity Act, passed in 2000, despite the opposition of labor unions, the textile industry, and the Congressional Black Caucus.[82] It for the first time provided incentives for U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa.[38] Indeed, Rangel became known for support of free trade agreements, in contrast to many House Democrats.[47][82]
Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Rangel helped secure an extension to unemployment benefits. His intent was to help those in New York industries affected by the events.[38]
Motivated by seeing few African American diplomats on his trips abroad,[82] he founded the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program in 2002. It is a collaboration between Howard University and the U.S. State Department that has significantly increased the number of minorities working in the U.S. Foreign Service.[38][90]
In July 2004, Rangel was the first of three sitting U.S. House members to be arrested on trespassing charges, for protesting human rights abuses in Sudan in front of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington[91] (Bobby Rush and Joe Hoeffel would follow). Rangel said, ""When human lives are in jeopardy, there should be outrage.""[91]
Rangel was an adamant opponent of the George W. Bush administration and of the Iraq War.[51] Feeling powerless to stop the latter in the Republican-controlled Congress, he said in 2007 that he had suffered from nightmares: ""It was my lowest point ever in my 37 years in Congress ... It was a sad period where you saw lives being lost [in the war] and you couldn't do anything about it.""[50] In April 2006, Rangel and nine other representatives joined John Conyers' action against George W. Bush and others, alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.[92] Conyers v. Bush was dismissed later that year for lack of standing.[93]
Rangel has been long been opposed to the all-volunteer army and repeatedly called for the government to bring back the draft (military conscription).[51] In 2003, Rangel said a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large, that ""the poor, black and brown shouldnt be the only Americans fighting and dying in Iraq"", and that ""Fairness dictates that the sons and daughters of the white middle and upper classes share the burden of war"".[94][95] During 2006, Rangel said that no soldier would be fighting in Iraq if they had decent career possibilities[96] and stated that:
There's no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.[97]
Rangel introduced versions of his Universal National Service Act in the House in 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2010.[94][98][99] Polls showed 70percent of Americans opposed a reinstatement of the draft.[97] Rangel emphasized that people could fulfill their draft obligations through non-military services, such as port and airline security.[97] The one time the act came up for a vote in the full House, in 2004, it was defeated 2402, with Rangel voting against his own bill in protest of the procedural handling of it.[51][100]
In June 2006, the House Appropriations Committee passed a $3million earmark to establish the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York.[101] By 2007 the amount had been reduced to $2million, but the funding for the Center, whose purpose was to bring more poor and minority students into politics, was the target of criticism from Representative John B. T. Campbell III of California and other Republicans as an abuse of the earmark process and as Rangel's ""Monument to Me"".[102][103] City College said it was proud to house the center[104] and Rangel said ""I cannot think of anything I am more proud of.""[102]
In August 2006, Rangel stated he would resign his seat if the Democrats did not take the House that November,[105] a statement that had real intent behind it, as at age 76 Rangel was feeling the claustrophobia of time.[51]
The Democrats did take control, and in January 2007, Rangel's long wait to head the Ways and Means Committee was over.[50] Not only was he the first African American to do so, but he was also the first New Yorker to chair the committee since Fernando Wood in the 1870s.[53] Now holder of one of the most powerful posts in all of Congress,[106] he said the chairmanship couldnt have come any later for me.[51] Age was not otherwise a factor with Rangel, who worked a scheduled 16 hours a day and looked a good deal younger than he was.[51] Ebony magazine termed Rangel's ascent to the chairmanship ""a watershed moment for African-Americans, who historically have been shut out when it comes to deciding how to divvy up the trillions of dollars in the federal government's budget.""[50] Rangel was able to establish an effective working relationship with ranking member Jim McCrery.[105]
In April 2007, Rangel published his autobiography, ... And I Havent Had a Bad Day Since: From the Streets of Harlem to the Halls of Congress, whose title reflected his experience in Korea. The New York Times gave it a favorable reviewing, saying it was ""mercifully short on laundry lists [that some other political memoirs have], but long on sass and spirit.""[106]
Rangel was an early and strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination.[107] His actions during 2007 included taking a shot at the marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology.[108][109] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially-tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying ""Theres just no question in my mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This aint no time for a beginner.""[110] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.[111]) Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.[112]
In July 2008, The Washington Post reported that Rangel was soliciting donations to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York from corporations with business interests before his Ways and Means Committee, and was doing so using Congressional letterhead.[113] Such companies and individuals included AIG, Donald Trump, and Nabors Industries, and by this time Rangel's efforts had helped raise $12million of the $30million goal for the center.[113] Government watchdog groups and ethics experts criticized Rangel's actions, with the dean of the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management saying Rangel ""has crossed the line"".[113]
Rangel denied any wrongdoing and asked the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, commonly known as the House Ethics Committee, to determine if his use of Congressional letterhead while arranging meetings to solicit contributions for the Center had violated any House rules.[103] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to Rangel's request.[103]
The New York Times reported in July 2008 that Rangel rents four apartments at below-market rates in the Lenox Terrace complex in Harlem. It reported that Rangel paid $3,894 monthly for all four apartments in 2007. In contrast, the landlord's going rate for similar apartments in the building was as high as $8,125 monthly. Three adjacent apartments were combined to create his 2,500-square-foot (230m2) home. A fourth unit is used as a campaign office, which violates city and state regulations that require rent-stabilized apartments to be used as a primary residence. Rangel received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from one of the landlords, according to the paper. Rangel said his rent does not affect his representation of his constituents.[66]
Congressional ethics experts said the difference in rent between what Rangel was paying and market rates, an estimated $30,000 per year, could be construed as a gift, exceeding the $100 House of Representatives gift limit.[66] In late July, the House voted 254138 to table a resolution by Republican Minority Leader John Boehner that would have censured Rangel for having ""dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House"", by occupying the four apartments.[114]
A September 2008 New York Post article reported that Rangel had been using a House parking garage as free storage space for his Mercedes-Benz for years, in apparent violation of Congressional rules. Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, free parking (here, worth $290 a month) is considered imputed income, and must be declared on tax returns.[115] In July 2010 the House Ethics Committee ruled that Rangel had committed no violation, since in practice the parking policy was only applied to Congressional staff and not to members themselves.[116]
Rangel was accused of failing to report income from his rental of a beachside villa he owns in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. A three-bedroom, three-bath unit, it has rented out for as much as $1,100 per night in the busiest tourist season.[117]
Labor lawyer Theodore Kheel, a principal investor in the resort development company and frequent campaign contributor to Rangel, had encouraged him to purchase the villa. Rangel purchased it in 1988 for $82,750. He financed $53,737.50 of the purchase price for seven years at an interest rate of 10.5%, but was one of several early investors whose interest payments were waived in 1990.[118]
In September 2008, Rangel's attorney, Lanny Davis, disclosed that Rangel had failed to report on his tax returns or in congressional disclosure forms $75,000 in income he had received for renting his Dominican villa. That month, Rangel paid $10,800 to cover his liability for the related back taxes.[119][120] He had owed back taxes for at least three years. The Ways and Means Committee writes the U.S. tax code, and as such his failure to pay taxes himself led to heavy criticism.[120]
A September 14, 2008, New York Times editorial called for Rangel to step down temporarily from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee while his ethical problems were investigated.[121]
On September 24, 2008, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate whether Rangel had violated its code of conduct or any law or other regulation related to his performance of his duties.[122] On November 23, 2008, The New York Post reported that Rangel took a ""homestead"" tax break on his Washington, DC, house for years, while simultaneously occupying multiple New York City rent-stabilized apartments, ""possibly violating laws and regulations in both cases.""[123] In January 2009, Republican Representative John R. Carter introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (H.R. 735), a tongue-in-cheek proposal that would have allowed all taxpayers to not pay penalties and interest on back taxes, in reference to Rangel not yet having paid his.[124]
In November 2008, following reports by The New York Times, Republican Congressmen asked the House Ethics Committee to look into Rangel's defense of a tax shelter approved by his Ways and Means Committee. One of the four companies that benefited from the loophole was Nabors Industries, which opened headquarters in Bermuda as a foreign corporation.[125] Under the loophole, Nabors receives tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks. In 2004, Rangel had led opposition to the tax breaks.[125] Nabors donated $1 million in 2006, and $100,000 later, to the City College of New York school named after Rangel.
Its CEO said the donations were unrelated to Rangel's February 2007 promise to oppose closing the loophole.[125] He denied there was any quid pro quo, and called the article about it ""malarkey"".[126] Rangel said The New York Times had ignored facts and explanations, and denied the charges.[125][127][128] The House Ethics Committee voted in December 2008, to expand its investigation of Rangel to the matter.[129] Eventually the Ethics Committee would not make a specific charge over this matter but did include it in the supporting documentation for the overall charge that Rangel had solicited Rangel Center donations from those with business before his committee.[130]
On September 15, 2008, it was disclosed that: a) Rangel had omitted from his financial reports details regarding his sale of a Washington, DC home; b) discrepancies existed in the values he listed for a property he owns in Sunny Isles, Florida (varying from $50,000 to $500,000); and c) inconsistencies appeared in his investment fund reporting. He apologized, saying ""I owed my colleagues and the public adherence to a higher standard of care, not only as a member of Congress, but even more as the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee."" Republicans called for his removal as chair. Rangel said there was no justification for that, as the mistakes were errors of omission, that would not justify loss of his position.[131]
In August 2009, Rangel amended his 2007 financial disclosure form to report more than $500,000 in previously unreported assets and income. That doubled his reported net worth. Unreported assets included a federal credit union checking account of between $250,000 and $500,000, several investment accounts, stock in Yum! Brands and PepsiCo, and property in Glassboro, New Jersey. Rangel also had not paid property taxes on two of his New Jersey properties, which he was required by law to do.
The ethics issues led by December 2008 to some loss of standing for Rangel, to Republicans trying to tie him to all Democrats, and to some Democrats privately saying it would be best if Rangel stepped down from his Ways and Means post.[132] In late 2008 and again in September 2009, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress.[133] Media pieces compared Rangel's woes with those of ethically challenged past Ways and Means chairs Wilbur Mills and Dan Rostenkowski.[80] Pelosi, a long-time friend of Rangel's, withheld any possible action against Rangel pending the House Ethics Committee report.[78] Rangel evinced impatience with that body, saying ""I don't have a complaint now, except that it's taking too goddamn long to review this thing and report back.""[80] On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post called on Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force him out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions,[78] including the Obama health care reform plan[80] (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama).[134] Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.[80]
In May 2009, the non-profit National Legal and Policy Center filed an ethics complaint against Rangel and other members of Congress for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to Caribbean islands. The trips had been sponsored by Carib News Foundation, a New York non-profit funded by corporations with interests before Congress and the Ways and Means Committee.[135] This, combined with the duration of the trips, seemed to violate House rules. The Ethics Committee agreed the following month to investigate the matter.[136]
On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee issued its report.[137] It determined that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his travel to the conferences.[138] It found that he had not known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost.[138] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips.[138] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying:
Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [the committee has decided] that I should have known. Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.[135]
Pelosi said she would not take any action against Rangel pending further committee findings, as his staff had been more at fault and he had not broken any law.[135] The Ethics Committee continued to investigate the charges against Rangel relating to obtaining rent-stabilized apartments, fundraising, and failure to disclose rental income from his Dominican villa.[135]
After a February 2010 House Ethics Committee report criticizing him for taking sponsored Caribbean trips, the White House backed off its prior support of Rangel somewhat, and within days 14 Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Rangel to step aside as Ways and Means chair.[139][140] Other Democrats were concerned that Rangel would impede Democrats' efforts to maintain their majority in the 2010 House elections, but did not say anything publicly out of respect and personal affection for Rangel.[139]
Momentum quickly built against Rangel, with 30 or more Democrats planning to oppose his continued chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, in a full House vote being pushed by Republicans.[141][142] Democrat Paul Hodes of New Hampshire noted:
I think we're in a zero-tolerance atmosphere, and I think ... Washington should be held to the highest ethical standards. I have the greatest admiration for Mr. Rangel's service to this country. He's been a great public servant. This is very, very unfortunate, but I think it's necessary.[141]
On March 3, 2010, Rangel said he would take a leave of absence as chair, pending issuance of the Ethics Committee's report.[143] Pelosi granted his request, but whether such a leave was possible was unclear and the House Speaker pro Tempore said that a resignation had taken place and that Rangel was no longer chair.[1][143] Observers opined that it was unlikely that Rangel would ever be able to regain the position.[142][143] Several Democrats said they would return or donate to charity campaign contributions given to them by Rangel.[142] Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan took over as acting chair.[144]
On July 22, 2010, a bipartisan, four-member investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee indicated it had ""substantial reason to believe"" that Rangel had violated a range of ethics rules relating to the other charges.[145] The matter was referred to another, newly created, special subcommittee to rule on the findings.[145][146]
Rangel negotiated with the Ethics Committee. But participants in the talks characterized him as unwilling to admit wrongdoing in connection with several of the charges, and anxious about preserving his legacy. No settlement was reached.[147]
On July 29, 2010, Rangel was charged by the committee with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws.[148] Rangel's lawyers continued to insist that he had not intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain.[148] Rangel somberly said only this on the day the charges were announced:
Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result I wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.[149]
By 2010, Rangel's continuing difficulties, together with the death a few months prior of Percy Sutton and the scandal around, and abandoned election campaign of, Governor David Paterson (Basil Paterson's son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's ""Gang of Four"".[65][150]
Rangel faced several Democratic primary challengers for his seat in 2010: Vincent Morgan, whose grassroots campaign bore many resemblances to Rangel's own against the scandal-plagued Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., in 1970;[151] Adam Clayton Powell IV, who had previously challenged Rangel in 1994; labor activist and past primary candidate for statewide office Jonathan Tasini; and former Obama campaign official Joyce Johnson.[48][145] While Rangel's fund-raising was down from previous years, and he had paid nearly $2 million in legal fees, he still had far more cash available for the campaign than any of his challengers.[48][145]
On September 14, 2010, Rangel prevailed in the primary election, gaining 51percent of the vote against Powell's 23percent and lesser amounts for the other contenders.[152] He then won the November 2, 2010, general election easily, garnering 80percent of the vote against Republican Michel Faulkner's 10percent and smaller amounts for third-party candidates.[153]
On November 15, 2010, Rangel's formal ethics trial began.[154] He walked out of the hearing at the start, saying that he was unable to afford representation after having paid his previous lawyers over $2million, and arguing unsuccessfully that the proceeding should be delayed until he could arrange for a legal defense fund.[154]
The following day, Rangel was found guilty on 11 of the 12 charges against him by the adjudicatory subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee (2 of the original 13 charges having been combined).[155][156] Two of the charges were focused on his actions with regards to soliciting funds and donations for the Rangel Center from those with business before the Ways and Means Committee; four were for improper use of Congressional letterhead and other House resources in those solicitations; one was for submitting incomplete and inaccurate financial disclosure statements; one was for using one of his Harlem apartments as an office when he had Congressional dealings with the landlord; one was for failing to pay taxes on his Dominican villa; and two reiterated these charges in describing general violations of House rules.[157]
Two days later, a near-tears Rangel pleaded for ""fairness and mercy"", but to no avail;[158] the full Committee voted 91 to recommend that the full House approve a sanction of censure upon Rangel.[159] The committee stated that ""Public office is a public trust [and Rangel] violated that trust.""[158] Censure is the strongest penalty the House can impose short of outright expulsion from Congress.[159] The Committee also said that Rangel should make restitution for any unpaid taxes.[159]
Supporters of Rangel argued that by comparison with previous cases, a reprimand would be a more fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure.[160] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself.[161] It was to no avail. On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's ""accumulation of actions"" that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones.[162] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267146.[161] The House of Representatives then voted 33379 to censure Rangel.[162] Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure.[163] It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured.[163] Rangel asked to speak and said, ""I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. Ill be judged by my life in its entirety.""[161]
Republicans took over control of the House as the 112th Congress began in January 2011, meaning Rangel would have lost his Ways and Means chair even without his ethics issues. But he was not considered for the ranking member slot either, which after a contested election among the Democratic caucus had gone to former acting chair Sander Levin.[164] Nor were his issues completely over; the National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that he had improperly paid legal bills from a political action committee.[165] To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses, he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee).[165]
In general, though, Rangel said that he wanted to ""pick up the pieces and move on"",[166] and he predicted that even though Republicans were in the majority again, they would have trouble uniting with newer members beholden to the Tea Party movement.[167]
During 2011, Rangel became the first member of Congress to declare support for the Occupy Wall Street movement and made several visits to their nearby demonstration site in Zuccotti Park.[168] However the protesters themselves picketed Rangel's office, objecting to his free trade stance (in particular to agreements he supported with Panama and with South Korea that they said resulted in jobs being exported).[168]
In early 2012, Rangel was beset by a back injury and a serious viral infection, and was away from Congress for three months.[169] Moreover, he had been redistricted into New York's 13th congressional district following the 2010 census; it included new geographic areas and its makeup was now 55percent Hispanic compared to 27percent African American.[54] As a result, Rangel faced a serious primary challenge from State Senator Adriano Espaillat.[169] Rangel struggled with fundraising, and he began receiving contributions from fellow members of Congress whom he had helped over the years.[170] In the June 26 primary, Rangel defeated Espaillat by less than a thousand votes, in a result that took two weeks to be fully resolved.[171] He won the subsequent November general election easily.[172]
Rangel ran again in 2014, facing Espaillat once more in the Democratic primary as well as Reverend Michael Walrond of the First Corinthian Baptist Church.[173] Rangel said that if he was re-elected, it would be his final term in the House.[173] Rangel lost some of his traditional endorsements, but still retained others and campaigned hard even while turning 84 years of age.[174] In the June 24 primary, voting was again close, but Rangel prevailed over Espaillat.[175] Rangel faced no Republican opposition in the November general election[175] and won it easily against a minor party candidate, saying as he voted on November 4, ""Today was a historic day and a very emotional day [as] I cast my final vote as a candidate on the ballot ...""[176]
After being strongly opposed to Benjamin Netanyahu's March 3, 2015, speech to Congress (in which, at the invitation of House Republicans, the Israeli Prime Minister spoke in opposition to the Obama administration's efforts to secure a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program) and saying he would be one of those Democrats not attending, Rangel changed his mind and did attend, attributing his reversal to the advice of friends and constituents and saying, ""Enough damage has already been done ... I don't want my absence to add to what is already a shattered type of relationship.""[177]
Various advocacy groups have given Rangel scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.[nb 3] Overall, as of 2003, Rangel had an average lifetime 91percent ""Liberal Quotient"" from Americans for Democratic Action. In contrast, the American Conservative Union assessed to Rangel a lifetime rating of less than 4percent through 2009.[178] National Journal rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 20052006, Rangel's averages were as follows: economic rating 91percent liberal and 6percent conservative, social rating 94percent liberal and 5percent conservative, and foreign rating 84percent liberal and 14percent conservative.[179]
Project Vote Smart provides the ratings of many, many lesser known interest groups with respect to Rangel.[180] Rangel typically has 100 ratings from NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood and, inversely, 0 ratings or close to that from the National Right to Life Committee.[180] He has typically gotten very high ratings, in the 90s or 100, from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.[180] The League of Conservation Voters has usually given Rangel around a 90 rating.[180] Taxpayers for Common Sense has given Rangel ratings in the middling 4050 range, while the National Taxpayers Union has typically given Rangel very low ratings, or an 'F' grade.[180]
Rangel is known as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one who is able to gain friendship and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor.[4][46][63] He is called ""Charlie"" by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees.[63] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, ""Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is.""[63] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called ""Rangeling"" by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill.[63] Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were ""tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent.""[63]
Rangel has been described as having a meticulous appearance.[80] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because he was one of those handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.[51] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: ""After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally.""[6] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of.[63] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it.[6] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.[181]
Rangel is known for his blunt speaking and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally.[46] This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him.[80] When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, ""Well, as Rhett Butler once said in Gone With the Wind, if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn.""[80] In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.
Some have been linked to his caustic criticism of George W. Bush's administration. For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the African-American civil rights movement, stating: ""George Bush is our Bull Connor.""[182][183] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against.[184] His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney,[105] who said, ""I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me  they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some  Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess.""[183] Rangel responded by saying, ""The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five.""[185] Rangel again expressed his displeasure with the vice president in October 2006  after Cheney had said that ""Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works""  by opining that Cheney is ""a real son of a bitch"" who ""enjoys a confrontation"", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects.[186][187] The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a ""big hearty laugh"" over them.[187]
Rangel could sometimes find the other side; following the 2006 Hugo Chvez speech at the United Nations in which the Venezuelan leader implied that Bush was the devil, Rangel said, ""I want President Chvez to please understand that even though many people in the United States are critical of our president that we resent the fact that he would come to the United States and criticize President Bush ... you don't come into my country, you don't come into my congressional district and you don't condemn my president.""[188]
Other remarks of Rangel's have revolved around Rangel's feelings about his home state and city, such as disparaging the state of Mississippi[nb 4] or suggesting that President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might be unsafe if they visited New York.[nb 5] In both cases, apologies from the congressman followed. In certain instances, his remarks only exacerbated his existing problems. When his ethics issues were made public, Rangel remarked that Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was ""disabled.""[nb 6] In 2013, he compared the Tea Party movement to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: ""It is the same group we faced in the South with those white crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough.""[189]
Since 1970, after defeating Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in the Democratic primary, Rangel has repeatedly won re-election to represent New York's 18th, 19th, 16th, 15th districts, or 13th districts.
Rangel was given the Jackie Robinson Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.[190] In 2006, he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Washington International Trade Association.[47]
Rangel has received a number of honorary degrees, including ones from Hofstra University (1989),[191] Syracuse University (2001),[192] Suffolk University Law School (2002),[193] and Bard College (2008).[194] In 2006 he received a Presidential Medal from Baruch College.[195]"
"270","","1999","1962","New York 14","Queens College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Crowley","Joseph Crowley","Democratic","New York State Assembly","Roman Catholic","Joseph Crowley (born March 16, 1962) is the U.S. Representative for New York's 14th congressional district. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He is the Vice-Chair of the Democratic Caucus, Chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party,.[1]


Crowley was born in New York City, the son of an Irish-American father and an immigrant Catholic mother from County Armagh, Northern Ireland. A paternal uncle was also a politician. Joseph Crowley attended private New York City Roman Catholic schools, including Power Memorial Academy, and graduated from Queens College with a degree in political science.[2] He worked briefly as a legislative aide.
In 1986, aged 24, he was elected to the New York Assembly. Because of his Irish roots, he quickly became involved in Irish politics throughout New York. Crowley would serve in the Assembly until 1998.[3][4]
Democratic Congressman Thomas J. Manton quietly retired from the Congress in 1999, having already filed for and circulated petitions for re-election. He withdrew on the last day it was legally possible to do so and arranged for Crowley, his chosen successor, to replace him on the ballot. Crowley wasn't aware of this until Manton phoned him to tell him his name would be on the general election ballot.[5]
Since 2013, Crowley has represented New York's 14th congressional district. The district includes the eastern Bronx and part of north-central Queens. The Queens portion includes the neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Astoria, College Point, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona and Woodside. The Bronx portion of the district includes the neighborhoods of Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, and Throgs Neck as well as City Island.
Prior to Redistricting for the 2012 election, Crowley represented the 7th District, which encompassed portions of Queens and the Bronx. It included neighborhoods such as Woodside, Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and College Point in Queens as well as the neighborhoods of Castle Hill, Co-op City, Parkchester, Throggs Neck, Morris Park, Pelham Parkway, Pelham Bay, Country Club, and City Island in the eastern Bronx.
Crowley serves as Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives, the fifth highest leadership position in the House Democratic Caucus.
Crowley's cousin, New York City firefighter John Moran, was killed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Crowley authored a bill that provided the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor to all emergency workers who died as a result of the terrorist acts. He also created the Urban Area Security Initiative, which directs money to prevent terrorism toward regions that are seen as the most threatened.
Crowley, who has spent much time in India, created a Bangladesh caucus and was formerly the chair of the India Caucus.[6]
On October 10, 2002, Crowley was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.[7]
Crowley joined Bronx Representative Jose Serrano in 2008 when proposing legislation to help clean up PCB-contaminated schools.[8]
In April 2011, Crowley received media attention for an angry ""speech"" he gave without actually speaking. Crowley ripped pieces of paper with words to deliver his message.[9][10]
He was, at one time, in between both sides of this debate. In 1999, he received a rating of 52% from NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) Pro-choice America and 53% from the National Right to Life Committee.[11] He voted in favor of the 1999 Abortion Funding Amendment that withheld federal funding to foreign institutions which provided family planning services and promoted abortion.[12] In addition, in 2003, he voted to ban partial-birth abortions (excepting cases which endanger the life of the mother).[13] However, recently, he has shifted his positions strongly in the pro-choice direction. Since 2005, he has consistently received ratings of 100% from NARAL, and 0% from the National Right to Life Committee.[11] In 2011, he opposed a bill which would have banned taxpayer funding for abortions,[13] and, in the 2010 election, he was endorsed by Planned Parenthood.[14]
Joseph Crowley has been a consistent supporter of The 2010 Affordable Care Act (widely known as Obamacare). On March 22, 2010, he stated, I... support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a historic measure that will put families first when it comes to accessing health care coverage. [15] He opposed repealing the act and voted against a repeal on January 19, 2011.[16] In addition, in 2011, he held an event to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the bills passage.[17]
Since 2007, he has received a rating of 100% from the American Public Health Association, American Nurses Association, and the National Breast Cancer coalition.[18]
Representative Crowley holds the view that reducing barriers to investment, creating opportunities for small businesses, and providing equitable working conditions for all Americans can and should be part of our national economic policy [19] He has supported federal spending as a way to increase economic growth. In 2008, he endorsed the Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments which established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to buy assets from troubled financial institutions.[20]
When dealing with the budget, Representative Crowley has advocated tax increases on the highest tax brackets, tax cuts for the middle class, and reduced defense spending. When serving on the Ways and Means Committee he stated,  'I really don't see how it's justifiable or sensible to give a tax cut to the wealthiest among us, but at the same time increase taxes on U.S. soldiers.[21] He also applauded the 2009 Budget for ending the Alternative Minimum Tax, and ensuring tax cuts for 23 million middle class Americans.[22] In addition, in 2011, he opposed a bill which appropriated funds to the defense budget.[23]
Crowley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. The seat was considered open after incumbent Rep. Thomas Manton retired, but not without controversy. Manton announced his retirement from Congress shortly after the deadline passed for individuals wishing to file for the Democratic primary. (Manton was the only individual who filed for the primary.) As head of the Queens Democratic Party apparatus, Manton was able to handpick his successor - Crowley, a former Manton staffer. Since being elected to Congress, he has yet to face a serious challenge for his seat.
In the 2012 election cycle, his top 5 donors were:
He also received $1,500,741 in PAC money. 89% came from business, 8% from labor, and 2% from ideological PACs. [24]
Joe has been married to his wife, Kasey Crowley, for over a decade and they have three young children. He lives in his family's longtime home in Virginia."

Serrano, a Democrat from New York, represents a district that is one of the smallest in the country geographically, consisting of a few miles of the heavily urbanized and populated South Bronx in New York City. His district is also one of the most densely populated and one of the few majority Hispanic districts in the country. The district was numbered the 18th from 1990 to 1993 and the 16th from 1993 to 2013; it has been the 15th district since 2013.


Serrano was born in Mayagez, Puerto Rico. At the age of seven, Serrano was taken by his family to The Bronx, where he was raised in the Millbrook Houses. Serrano went to Grace Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx and then attended Lehman College. He served in the United States Army medical corps from 1964 to 1966.
He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1990, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th and 188th New York State Legislatures. His district was numbered the 75th until 1982, and the 73rd from 1983 on. He was Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs, and of the Committee on Education.
In 1990, Serrano won a special election for the seat vacated by resigning U.S. Congressman Robert Garca with 92% of the vote.[2] He has never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote,[3][4] in what is considered one of the safest seats in Congress.
In 2004, Congressman Serrano faced an electoral challenge from Jose Serrano, an unemployed former loading dockworker with the same name who eventually dropped out of the race in July.[5]
Serrano has consistently supported initiatives to resolve Puerto Rico's political status problem, including the 1998 Young bill, which he coauthored, and the December 22, 2005, report of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status, which recommends that Congress provide an opportunity for residents in Puerto Rico to vote for or against its current status, which the report describes as an unincorporated U.S. territory and Serrano describes as a U.S. colony. Serrano filed a bill, HR 900, with Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuo, co-sponsored by 129 other Democratic and Republican members of Congress, to authorize such a referendum by 2009.[6]
A member of the Progressive Caucus, he is widely regarded as one of the most progressive members of Congress. He has been questioned about his pork barrel spending by some fiscal conservative members of Congress. Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake once said of Serrano's $150,000 earmark to repair the roof at the city-owned Arthur Avenue Market (a historic indoor produce and prepared food market in the Bronx's ""Little Italy""), ""I would argue this is one cannoli the taxpayer doesnt want to take a bite of.""[7] Serrano replied to Flake, ""The more you get up on these, sir, the more I realize that you do not know what you are talking about. I make no excuses about the fact that I earmark dollars to go in the poorest congressional district in the nation, which is situated in the richest city on earth.""[7]
On November 18, 2005, he was one of three votes in favor of immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The other two votes were from Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Robert Wexler of Florida.[8]
In 1997 [HJR 19],[9] 1999 [HJR 17],[10] 2001 [HJR 4],[11] 2003 [HJR 11],[12] 2005 [HJR 9],[13] 2007 [HJR 8],[14] 2009 [HJR 5],[15] and 2011 [HJR 17],[16] Serrano introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to repeal the 22nd Amendment, thereby removing the limitation on the number of terms an individual may serve as president. Each resolution, with the exception of the current one, died without ever getting past the committee.[17][18] On January 3, 2013, Serrano proposed the repeal of the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which would remove the restriction on the number of terms a President may serve. This has been met with heavily negative backlash in social media, including a flood of so-called ""hateful"" comments on his Facebook page.
Serrano has paid attention to local environmental issues in New York, with a particular focus on constructing greenways, acquiring parklands, and cleaning up the Bronx River, which runs through his district. Recently a beaver was discovered swimming in the river for the first time in 200 years, something seen as a testament to his efforts.[19] In 2007, he engineered the purchase of the last privately owned island in New York harborSouth Brother Islandfor preservation in perpetuity by the City of New York as a wildlife refuge for rare shorebirds.
Serrano was a critic of the Bush administration's approach to handling President Hugo Chvez of Venezuela. In 2005, while the Venezuelan President was in New York City speaking before the United Nations, the congressman invited him to his district to speak to his constituency.
Serrano is one of three New York-area congressmen on the House Appropriations Committee, the others being Nita Lowey of the 18th district and Steve Israel of 3rd district. He is currently the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services, having previously served as the chair. As chairman, he successfully engineered the inclusion of language in the 2007 omnibus spending bill that guarantees the extension of the 50 State Quarters program to include the minting of 6 additional quarters to honor the District of Columbia and the 5 United States territories, including Serrano's native Puerto Rico.
Serrano has also been an advocate for Puerto Ricans under FBI prosecution. In May 2000, he brokered an agreement with then-FBI Director Louis Freeh, then Puerto Rican Independence Party senator Manuel Rodrguez Orellana and then Puerto Rico Senate Federal Affairs Committee chairman Kenneth McClintock, the islands' outgoing Senate President, that has resulted in the release of nearly 100,000 pages of previously secret FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists.
In the aftermath of the death of Hugo Chvez, Congressman Serrano wrote condolences to Chavez via Twitter describing him as a leader who ""understood the needs of the poor. He was committed to empowering the powerless. R.I.P. Mr. President.[20] However, the comments proved controversial with some twitterers[21] and political commentators[22] and prompted a response from the Republican National Committee that described Serrano's tweet as ""simply insulting that a Democrat Congressman would praise the authoritarian ruler Hugo Chvez.
Serrano's son, Jos M. Serrano, is a member of the New York State Senate. In addition to Jos Marco, Serrano has four other children."

He is a member of the Democratic Party. His new district, District 16, contains parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. In Westchester, it includes Yonkers, Mt. Vernon, New Rochelle, Scarsdale. Mamaroneck, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Larchmont, Tuckahoe, Bronxville, Eastchester, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley, Hartsdale, and Rye City. In the Bronx, it includes Riverdale, Woodlawn, Edenwald, Baychester, Williamsbridge, Van Cortlandt Village, and Wakefield, and Co-op City. He represented the 19th District from 1989 to 1993, and the 17th District from 1993 to 2013. District 17 consisted of parts of the Bronx, Westchester County, and Rockland County.
In 2013, he became the ranking minority member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, replacing Howard Berman, who lost his re-election bid in the 2012 elections.


Engel was born in the Bronx, the son of Sylvia (ne Bleend) and Philip Engel, an ironworker. His grandparents of Ukrainian Jewish[1] roots immigrated from Russia.[2] He grew up in a city housing project Eastchester Gardens and attended New York City public schools. In 1969, he graduated from Hunter-Lehman College with a Bachelor of Arts in history and received a master's degree in Guidance and Counseling in 1973 from Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York. In 1987, he received a law degree from New York Law School. He began his political career in local Democratic clubs. He taught in New York City School District and was a guidance counselor. He taught Junior High School at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976 and at Intermediate School 174 after that.
In 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the New York State Assembly after the incumbent Democrat Alan Hochberg was forced to resign. He risked all of his life savings and won by 103 votes. He was the Liberal Party nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.[3]
Engel was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures. He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, as well as the Subcommittee on the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.
In 1988, Engel ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York's 19th congressional district. He defeated incumbent Democrat Mario Biaggi in the primary with 48% of the vote.[4] Biaggi had been charged with racketeering in the Wedtech scandal;[5] he was eventually jailed by Rudy Giuliani. He won the general election with 56% of the vote.[6] He never won re-election with less than 61% in a general election. He only faced competitive primary elections (getting less than 70%) twice (1994 and 2000). In 1994, he defeated musician Willie Coln 62%-38%.[7] In 2000, Engel defeated State Senator Larry Seabrook, who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez, 50%41%.[8]
Engel can be seen shaking hands with the president during televised State of the Union addresses.[9] Along with other Members of Congress, Engel shows up to the Capitol early in order to guarantee that he will get an aisle seat. Engel has managed to shake hands with the president at every address and be seen by his constituents on television since 1989. He has expressed that ""It's an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is.""[10]
Engel supports quality access to health care and refers to himself as pro-choice ""all the way.""[11] Engel is a co-sponsor of the United States National Health Care Act, which would implement a single payer health care system in the United States. He was a strong supporter of the landmark Affordable Care Act, committing his vote only after securing provisions that New York would not be penalized for being a do-gooder state.[12]
In 2008, Engel authored the ALS Registry Act (P.L. 110-373),[13] which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Act (P.L. 110-361),[14] which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.
He wrote the Partnering to Improve Maternity Care Quality Act, introduced in 2010, to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns and do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers and purchasers. In 2010, Engel wrote the Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010, which passed the House before not coming to a vote in the Senate. The legislation could be re-introduced in the 113th Congress for consideration. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which if untreated could lead to Type 2 diabetes for both mother and child.
Rep. Engel supports an improved re-authorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act.[15] This measure provides increased U.S. support for international Tuberculosis control activities and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics and vaccines.
In 2005, Engel introduced with Congressman Jack Kingston (R-GA) the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and reintroduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670)  the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act  with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's national security and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency  to increase a vehicle's gas miles.[16]
Many provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the Energy Independence and Security Act, which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown biofuels like cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel and biobutanol.
On July 22, 2008, Engel introduced with Congressmen Kingston, Steve Israel (D-NY) and Bob Inglis (R-SC) the Open Fuel Standards Act.[17] This bill requires 50 percent of new cars sold in the United States by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be flexible-fuel vehicles capable of running on any combination of ethanol, methanol or gasoline. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version. This bill was resubmitted in the 111th United States Congress by Rep. Engel, Inglis, Israel and Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD). It was re-introduced in the 112th Congress with Rep. John Shimkus as the lead Republican. It will likely be re-introduced in the 113th Congress.
Engel is the senior Representative from New York on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Representative from New York on the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454,[18] which passed the House on June 26, 2009.[19] That legislation was intended to revitalize the economy by creating millions of new jobs, increase American national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, and preserve the planet by reducing the pollution.[20] It passed the House in 2009, but was not voted on by the Senate in the 111th Congress.
Engel believes in requiring background checks on gun sales between private citizens at gun shows,[21] and disagrees with the statement that ""District of Columbia does not have the authority to enact laws or regulations that 'discourage or eliminate' private ownership or use of firearms.""[22] Rep. Engel signed a letter to President Barack Obama urging the ""return to enforcement of the law banning imports of assault weapons, which was previously enforced during the administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.""[23] He also opposed a bill that would allow visitors to carry firearms while inside certain national parks.[24]
Engel has received an ""F"" grade from the National Rifle Association. Rep. Engel strongly believes in restricting citizen gun use through ""smart gun"" technology, extending waiting periods for citizens, and allowing the victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers and authorized sellers.[21]
Conversely, Engel has received a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.[25] In addition, he has also been given a 100 percent grade from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.[26] Rep. Engel repeatedly votes in favor of stricter gun control laws. He introduced H.R. 1784, the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act, which would ban the Five-seveN handguns. Rep. Engel introduced H.R. 2217, intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.[27]
Anti 2nd Amendment communist. Should be voted out of office and sent to Cuba.
On December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Truth in Caller ID Act. The legislation was introduced by Bill Nelson in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Rep. Engel's bill.[28] The new law cracks down on the use of caller ID spoofing, often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information. The legislation will help law enforcement combat identity theft.
Rep. Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702.[29] That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler's data or equipment without cause.[30] The legislation was reintroduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239.[31] The Department of Homeland Security altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause.[32] This encompassed much of Rep. Engel's legislation.
In the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402.[33] The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry.[34] The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Rep. Engel introduced the Drug Testing Integrity Act, which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.
In 2010, Engel urged the Federal Housing Finance Agency to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on cooperative apartment sales. Some developers and investors had been abusing the system by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee when used correctly can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.
In 2012, Engel introduced SNOPA, the Social Network Online Protection Act guarantees online privacy, and ensures that employers and educational institutions cannot use your personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment or enrollment process. The bill has been re-introduced in the 113th Congress, with Rep. Michael Grimm as the Republican lead, and Rep. Jan Schakowski as an original co-sponsor.
Engel is a supporter of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and has also been an advocate for the causes of Albanian-Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In 2003, he authored the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003.[35] In this Law, Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with Syria for its occupation of Lebanon and for its relationship with terrorist groups.
As Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Engel has called for stronger U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. His Subcommittee has held hearings on issues such as the crisis in Haiti, poverty and inequality in Latin America.
Engel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti and for Temporary Protective Status (TPS) of Haitian nationals in the U.S.[36] Engel is also supportive of the ""Mrida Initiative"" in which the U.S. is cooperating with Mexico, Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti to counter narco-trafficking and related violence in the region. In the 110th United States Congress, he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007[37] (re-introduced in 2009, where it also died in committee[38]) and sponsored the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act to develop partnerships to strengthen diplomatic relations with the Government of Brazil and the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere (died in committee).[39]
The bipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009 (sponsored by Rep. Engel) was passed by the House on December 8, 2009; it would have taken a fresh look at the United States' counter-narcotics efforts both at home and abroad. The bill did not pass the Senate.[40]
Engel has been a vocal supporter of Israel. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations.[41] Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel.[42] He also wrote the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003.[43] This law authorized restrictions on American relations with Syria and penalties for its occupation of Lebanon and for its relationship with terrorist groups.
In 1996, The Washington Post wrote, ""The Kosovo cause has been kept alive in Washington by a small group of congressmen led by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.)....""[44] While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus, Engel fought ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in 1999 and voiced support in Congress for independence of Kosovo. A street has been named after him in Pe and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the Kosovo parliament.[45]
Engel called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and authored a resolution in 1996 its demilitarization. His 1994 law allowed the United States Department of State to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and found the remains of one.[46] Engel received the George Paraskevaides Award on May 17, 2007, given to those who have utilized ancient Hellenic values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world.[47]
In 2002, Engel joined the two Senators from New York, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, and almost 300 members of the United States House of Representatives in voting for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq.[48] After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable, and the subsequent problems faced after Saddam Hussein was deposed, Engel has come to regret his decision to support the invasion, and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal. He has met with anti-war activists, and in 2008, he publicly called for the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Engel received an ""A"" grade from the Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans in 2008.[49]
In 2007, Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. He supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States.[50] He has been a friend of Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fin,[51] and was the author of legislation that prohibits employers in Northern Ireland and Ireland from receiving U.S. funds from the International Fund for Ireland unless they comply with fair employment and non-discrimination principles called the ""MacBride Principles"".[52] In 2010, Rep. Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the United States after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in Rockland County
As a member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Engel has supported Albanian-Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. He is co-author of the Harkin-Engel Protocol, along with Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), which addresses child labor in the cocoa fields of West Africa.
In early 2001, he wrote the House resolution condemning the Taliban for forcing Hindu citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the Nazis forcing Jews to wear a yellow Star of David.[53] In 2008, he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality.[54]
Engel sponsored a bill to support the Day of Silence during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in schools.[55] That bill has been resubmitted in the 111th United States Congress.[56] He also voted against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states.[57] He voted in 2010 to repeal the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, enabling homosexuals to serve openly in the U.S. Military.
Engel was criticized[58] for choosing to attend a July 2008 event hosted by the controversial pastor John Hagee, who has suggested that God sent Adolf Hitler to bring the Jews to Israel.[59]
In March 2009, the AP reported that Engel had been taking an annual tax credit on his Maryland residence for at least ten years, despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence. Engel ran for reelection in the Bronx at least five times while claiming a primary residence credit in Maryland, during which time he received ""thousands of dollars"" in tax credits. Maryland officials revoked the tax credit.[60] The Washington Post reported that the matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics in August, 2009, and that the Office was ""[e]xpecting OCE notice of termination"" for Engel.""[61] The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel, and Reps. Doris Matsui and Edolphus Towns, without recommending further investigation by the ethics committee.[62]
Publisher Christopher Hagedorn has often used his Bronx weekly newspapers, the Bronx News, the Parkchester News, and the Co-op City News, to attack Engel.[63] Hagedorn believes that Engel, when he was still an Assemblyman, was behind a failed effort in 1988 to evict the Co-op City News from its offices in Co-op City.[64] Since 1988, Hagedorn has published numerous editorials and articles attacking Engel and even reprinted critical articles about him that have been published in other newspapers. Hagedorn has often endorsed Engel's opponents in the Democratic primary and the general election but the Congressman always won re-election to Congress. In 2000, Hagedorn intensified his campaign against Engel when the leadership of the powerful Bronx County Democratic organization decided to support former Assemblyman and City Councilman Larry Seabrook in the primary against Engel.[65] Seabrook, whose campaign was plagued with problems, lost the primary to Engel by a wide margin.
Engel has mostly ignored Hagedorn's attacks. In 1995, however, his then-communications director Greg Howard, told the Bronx Beat newspaper, which wrote about the feud, ""We don't consider Mr. Hagedorn a legitimate journalist. He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has. He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences.""[63] In the last decade, Hagedorn's newspapers have mostly ignored Engel.
Engel received an ""A"" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005[66] Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. He also received a 100% from the League of Conservation Voters for his record on the environment.
Engel has received positive marks from major environmental groups such as the League of Conservation Voters[67] and the Sierra Club.[68]
In 1998, as a response to Engel's work in Albania and Kosovo, the Italian government presented him, and his then-Administrative Assistant John Calvelli, with a ceremonial knighthood[69] for his work in promoting United States-Italian ties. Ambassador Fernando Salleo issued the knighthood and Italian Consular General in New York Antonio Bandini performed the ceremony.

She is a member of the Democratic Party. Lowey's district was numbered as the 20th from 1989 to 1993, as the 18th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 17th since 2013.


Lowey was born in the Bronx in New York, New York, the daughter of Beatrice (Fleisher) and Jack Melnikoff.[1] She graduated from The Bronx High School of Science and then Mount Holyoke College with a bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. She served as a government official before entering elected politics and was once the Assistant Secretary of State of New York.
Lowey was first elected to the House of Representatives from New York's 20th congressional district in 1988. Following redistricting after the 1990 Census, Lowey was elected from the 18th district. Her district is located in the northern suburbs of New York City and includes most of Westchester County including New Rochelle, White Plains, Chappaqua, Greenburgh, Scarsdale, Tarrytown, Mamaroneck, Ossining, and part of Yonkers, as well as part of eastern Rockland County, including the county seat New City, Haverstraw, and Congers. She used to represent parts of Queens and the Bronx, until redistricting after the 2000 Census created her current district.
Lowey strongly considered running for the United States Senate in 2000, but stepped aside when First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her candidacy. Lowey was considered a top contender for appointment to Clinton's Senate seat after Clinton was nominated to be Secretary of State, but in a December 1, 2008 phone interview with the Associated Press, she stated that she isn't interested in giving up her senior seat on the House Appropriations Committee.[2]
In 2004, Lowey received 69% of the vote against political newcomer Richard A. Hoffman, a Wall Street investor and largely self-funded candidate who ran on a platform of opposing special interests and cutting federal taxes. Lowey emphasized her track record on homeland security issues, notably her work to reform the formula for distributing homeland security grants to states.
In 2006, also against Hoffman, Lowey won with 70%.
Lowey was re-elected to an eleventh term in 2008, with 68% of the vote against unsupported James C. ""Jim"" Russell.
Lowey received an ""A"" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. She received 12% on the Club for Growth's 2007 congressional scorecard.[3] According to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Lowey consistently votes in support of the policies of the Democratic Party, and is seen as a strong and effective progressive voice in that legislative body.[4]
Her voting record on mass surveillance earned her a ""D"" on the Stand Against Spying Congressional Scorecard, which was created by a coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum advocating for transparency and an end to mass surveillance.[5]
Early in her Congressional career, Lowey sponsored an earmark for the purpose of ""dredging the Mamaroneck Harbor.""[6] According to the local newspaper, The Journal News, the dredging was proposed because ""the harbor was becoming too shallow 'to accommodate the larger yachts.'""[6]
In 20012002, Lowey was the first female chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She was a member of the House Appropriations Committee.[when?]
One of the notable causes she supports is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in support of which she appeared at a congressional hearing accompanied by Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie.
Lowey has been a vocal advocate for a Security Council Resolution on the conflict in Darfur. She is responsible for the $500 million in the Emergency Spending Bill for Aid in Darfur. She is also pushing for $1.2 Billion in the next fiscal year.
Lowey voted for HR 2454, the ""Cap and Trade"" legislation.[7]
Lowey voted for HR 1105, the 2009 Budget Bill.
In early 2009, Lowey introduced the Transportation Security Workforce Enhancement Act, which calls for collective bargaining rights for federal workers at the TSA and Department of Homeland Security.[8] However, some statements from the TSA dispute the necessity of collective bargaining.[9]
She was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act. Because of the rancor and disruptions which marked so many of the so-called Town Hall meetings held in the summer of 2009 to discuss Health Care Reform, Lowey chose to present her point of view on Health Care Reform in a telephone conference call, the effectiveness of which was questioned by some of her constituents.[10] However, Lowey routinely appears around her district to talk one-on-one with her constituents at town fairs, events and public meetings.
Nita Lowey has been married to Stephen Lowey for over 45 years. Stephen Lowey is a named partner in the law firm of Lowey Dannenberg Cohen & Hart, P.C., which is located in White Plains, NY. According to the West Corporation, his practice areas include Securities Law, Antitrust Law, and Consumer Protection. Nita and Stephen Lowey have three children, and eight grandchildren. The estimate of her personal asset wealth based on financial disclosures Congressional Representatives are required to provide (aside from that of personal residences and non-interest bearing bank accounts), puts Rep. Lowey's wealth at $41.2 million in 2010, based largely on her husband's investments.[11] This is derived from a special investigative series of asset wealth of all U.S. Congressional Representatives conducted by the Washington Post.[11]"
"274","","2013","1966","New York 18","University of Virginia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Patrick_Maloney","Sean Patrick Maloney","Democratic","Attorney","Roman Catholic","Sean Patrick Maloney (born July 30, 1966) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who has served as the U.S. Representative for New York's 18th congressional district since 2013. Born in Quebec, Canada and raised in Hanover, New Hampshire, he earned his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia. He entered politics as a volunteer for Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns, and later served as his senior West Wing adviser and White House Staff Secretary. After the Clinton Administration he served as the First Deputy Secretary to New York Governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson.
Prior to being elected to Congress, he worked as an executive in a private equity firm and as an attorney. In 2006 he ran in the Democratic primary for New York Attorney General, but came in third to Mark J. Green and winner Andrew Cuomo. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012 after defeating Republican incumbent Nan Hayworth. He campaigned for the election as a moderate and is a member of the New Democrat Coalition.[1][2] He is the first openly gay person to be elected to Congress from New York.


Maloney was born on July 30, 1966 in Sherbrooke, Quebec;[3] to United States citizen parents. Maloney's father's work as a lumberjack had temporarily brought them to Canada. Maloney grew up in Hanover, New Hampshire with his six siblings in what he describes as a ""small Irish Catholic family.""[4][5]
After attending Georgetown University for two years, Maloney transferred to the University of Virginia where he earned his Bachelor of Arts in international relations in 1988.[5] After earning his undergraduate degree, Maloney spent a year volunteering with Jesuit priests in the slums of Chimbote, Peru.[3][4] Afterwards Maloney returned to the U.S. and earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1992.[4]
From 2000 to 2003, Maloney served as Chief Operating Officer of Kiodex, Inc.[6] Maloney was a senior attorney at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, during which time he represented the Matthew Shepard Foundation.[7] In March 2011 he joined the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe as a partner.[8]
In 1991, Maloney began working on Bill Clinton's first campaign for President as Deputy to Susan Thomases, the chief scheduler, and in Clinton's re-election campaign Maloney worked as Director of Surrogate Travel.[5] After the successful campaign Maloney was offered a position in the White House staff and served as a senior advisor and White House Staff Secretary from 1999 through 2000, among the youngest to serve in that capacity.[9][10] At a campaign event Clinton stated that Maloney worked closely with him.[11]
Following the killing of gay University of Wyoming student, Matthew Shepard, Maloney was one of two representatives Clinton sent to his funeral. In an article about the event, a newspaper noted that Maloney often refers to himself as ""the highest ranking openly homosexual man on the White House staff.""[4][9]
Maloney ran for the Democratic nomination for New York Attorney General in 2006. According to Gay City News, Maloney's ""competitive fundraising and wide travels across the state during the past year have impressed many party professionals with the seriousness of his run.""[12][13] During the campaign Maloney was endorsed by the Empire State Pride Agenda, a New York state based gay rights organization; and Karen Burstein, the first lesbian to run for Attorney General in 1994.[14]
Consistently polling in the single digits, Maloney was offered a chance to run for the office on the Liberal Party ticket, but declined saying he would support whoever won the Democratic nomination.[15] Maloney came in third place in the September 12, 2006 election, obtaining 9.4% of the vote against Andrew Cuomo, former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and son of past Governor Mario Cuomo, and Mark Green, former New York City Public Advocate. In his concession speech, Maloney said ""this day may not be the outcome we hope, but I make you a promise that there will be another day.""[16]
Maloney joined Governor Eliot Spitzer's administration in January 2007 as First Deputy Secretary under top adviser Rich Baum.[17]
The Eliot Spitzer political surveillance scandal (popularly known as ""Troopergate"") broke out on July 23, 2007 when New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office admonished Spitzer's administration for ordering the State Police to create special records of Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City.[18] A New York Times editorial suggested that Maloney might have been involved by withholding emails during the investigation,[19] and the Times endorsed Maloney's 2012 election opponent because of its concerns about Maloney's handling of the investigation.[20] The Wall Street Journal wrote in July 2012, ""generally, those involved in the investigation on both sides defend Mr. Maloney's conduct. Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff at the time, Steve Cohen, called the idea that Mr. Maloney got in the way of the Attorney General's inquiry 'misinformed to the point of being laughable.'""[8]
Maloney continued in the same role as a top adviser to Governor David Paterson's administration under his top adviser, Charles O'Byrne.[21] While working for Paterson, Maloney worked on Paterson's effort to increase state aid to education.[22] On December 3, 2008, Maloney announced that he would leave Governor Paterson's office to join the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.[23]
In March 2012, Maloney announced his intention to run for New York's newly-drawn 18th congressional district, running against Congresswoman Nan Hayworth who was redrawn from the 19th district. Maloney won the Democratic primary on June 26 with 48% of the vote, winning against four other challengers.[24] In addition to the Democratic Party line, Maloney also ran on the Working Families Party ticket with New York's fusion voting.[25]
Maloney drew criticism for the fact that he bought a house in Cold Springs before the election, never having previously lived in the district.[26] On June 11, former President Bill Clinton announced his endorsement of Maloney, saying ""I support Sean because I know hell be an outstanding member of Congress.""[27] On October 21 The New York Times endorsed Maloney, stating that his opponent ""has favored limiting contraception coverage for employees and voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Mr. Maloney promises to support health care reform, help the middle class and oppose tax cuts for the rich. We recommend Mr. Maloney.""[28] Maloney also was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, and the AFL-CIO and New York State United Teachers Union.[29][30]
In the general election Maloney campaigned as a moderate[1][31] and defeated Hayworth 52%48%. During his victory speech Maloney said, ""I think people want change in Washington... They're tired of the fighting and the bickering.""[32] Maloney is New York's first openly gay member of Congress.[33]
Maloney ran for re-election, defeating Nan Hayworth.[34][35] Maloney was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline Program. The program is designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election.[36] Maloney lost the Independence Party primary to Hayworth, but ultimately defeated her in the general election.[37]
On January 3, 2013 Maloney was sworn into the 113th United States Congress. On his second day in office, Maloney spoke on the House Floor, criticizing the House Leadership for blocking needed aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy, and urged House Speaker John Boehner and his colleagues to pass an aid package immediately.[38]
In his first 100 days in office, he held a grand opening event of his district office in Newburgh, New York. Nearly 100 city and county officials were present at the opening, and many praised Maloney for establishing a physical presence in the city. Maloney is the first elected official to open an office in Newburgh in at least three decades.[39]
After joining the ""No Labels Problem Solvers"" caucus, Maloney supported the ""No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013"".[40] Leading up to the 2013 government shutdown, Maloney faced criticism for voting with Republicans to pass a budget which included provisions delaying the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. His vote drew the ire of LGBT groups, some accusing him of being a ""Democrat In Name Only"" (""DINO"")[41] He has been an outspoken critic of sequestration and the harmful effects it would have on the United States Military Academy at West Point, and sent a letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, asking for flexibility in his district.[42] During the shutdown Maloney requested that his pay be withheld in solidarity with federal workers.[43]
In April of his first year in office, Maloney introduced the Creating Reliability for Our Producers Act, the Dam Safety Act, and the Disabled Veterans Red Tape Reduction Act.[44] In October, 2013 the House passed Maloney's Disabled Veterans Red Tape Reduction Act with near unanimous support. Maloney's bill would allow disabled veterans to have their medical examinations performed by physicians outside the Veterans Affairs system.[45]
In June 2013 Maloney voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The purpose of the bill is to ban abortions that would take place 20 or more weeks after fertilization.[46]
In July 2013 Maloney voted to reject to the Farm Bill. The comprehensive farm bill failed in the House due largely in part to the votes of 8 Democratic House members who joined the Republican majority to vote down the measure.[47]
An issue arising in his election to Congress was whether the candidates would vote to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA); while Hayworth was considered more progressive on gay rights than most Republicans, she did not explicitly say if she would vote to repeal, stating her belief that the New York law allowing same-sex marriage made it a settled issue, for which Maloney criticized her.[33] Following the Supreme Court's ruling which struck down provisions of DOMA, Maloney remarked at a press conference he was ""no longer seen as less-than in the eyes of my country,""[48] having previously faced discrimination in the House, with his partner not eligible for benefits as most heterosexual members' partners would.[49]
On April 10, 2014, Maloney introduced the Human Trafficking Prevention Act (H.R. 4449; 113th Congress), a bill that would require regular training and briefings for some federal government personnel to raise awareness of human trafficking and help employees spot cases of it.[50][51] The bill passed in the House on July 23, 2014.[52]
In July 2014, the FAA began an investigation into whether unmanned aircraft used for Maloneys wedding violated the agencys ban on drone flights. A spokesman for Maloney, who is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committees aviation subcommittee, which oversees the FAA, acknowledged that drones were hired.[53][54][55]
Maloney serves on the following committees:[56]
Maloney has been with his husband Randy Florke since 1992, when they met in New York City where Maloney was helping plan the Democratic National Convention. Together they have three adopted children.[4] Florke is an interior decorator who has been featured in Oprah's magazine.[61] Maloney and his family live in the Putnam County community of Cold Spring, New York. On January 14, 2014, Maloney announced that he and Florke had become engaged on Christmas Day 2013.[62] On June 21, 2014, he and Florke were married in Cold Spring, New York.[63] Maloney became the second member of Congress to legally marry his same-sex partner while in office. The first being former Congressman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, in 2012.[64]"

""Chris"" Gibson (born May 13, 1964) is an American politician, former officer in the United States Army and member of the Republican Party who has served as the U.S. Representative for New York's 19th congressional district since 2011.
A lifelong resident of Kinderhook, New York, Gibson joined the United States Army in 1986 after graduating from Siena College. He served tours in the First Gulf War, Kosovo, and Iraq, rising to the rank of Colonel. He later taught American politics at West Point and was a national security affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[4] He has received four Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, among other awards while in the military. He also holds a Ph.D in government from Cornell University. In 2008, he published his first book, Securing the State, which offered his overview on national security decision-making.
He retired from the Army in 2010 to run for Congress, defeating Democratic incumbent Scott Murphy with 55% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. In January 2015, Gibson, a supporter of term limits, announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016. He is seen as a possible candidate for statewide office in 2018.


Gibson was born in Rockville Centre, New York to Robert and Barbara Gibson, and moved to Kinderhook at a young age. He attended Ichabod Crane High School there, where he was point guard and co-captain of the basketball team. He then attended Siena College in upstate New York, having earned his ROTC Commission and graduating magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in history.[3][5]
Gibson took his commission with the United States Army after graduating from Siena. While in the Army Gibson rose to the rank of Colonel, serving seven tours including four combat tours in Iraq, as well as separate tours in Kosovo, the American Southwest in counter-narcotics interdiction and most recently deploying to Haiti after the earthquake where he led the 82nd Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team during the opening month of the humanitarian effort there.[3]
Throughout his career Gibson earned a number of military decorations, including a Purple Heart, 4 Bronze Stars, 2 Legions of Merit, the Master Parachutist Badge, the Combat Infantrymans Badge with Star and the Ranger tab. His units have also won awards, for their actions in Mosul in support of the first Iraqi national elections his Battalion Task Force earned the Valorous Unit Award. Later in Tal Afar his battalion and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment were recognized for excellence by the President and earned a 2nd Valorous Unit Award.[6][not in citation given]. Gibson was selected as the General George C. Marshall Award winner at the top graduate of the US Army Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth.[citation needed]
Gibson earned an MPA, as well as an MA and Ph.D. in government, from Cornell University.[7] He then became a Professor of American Politics at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was a National Security fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University where he wrote a book on Civil-Military relations, Securing the State.[6]
Gibson challenged Democratic incumbent Scott Murphy for the 20th Congressional district seat in the House of Representatives and won on November 4, 2010.
While there were initially four candidates for the GOP nomination, the other three all dropped their bid, with one of them, Patrick Ziegler, joining Gibsons staff as his campaign manager.[8][9] The uncontested Republican and Conservative candidate, Gibson outraised Murphy in his first full quarter in the campaign, and was a GOP Young Gun.[10][11]
A supporter of term limits, Gibson promised to serve no more than four terms. He also called for Representatives to be limited to eight years in office, with terms being extended from two years to four, which he called a ""creative way"" to address campaign finance reform without ""impeding"" free speech.[12]
Beginning in September, Gibson saw a steady rise in polling numbers: he started behind at 37% compared to Murphy's 54%. However by October 26, Gibson had risen to 51% and Murphy had fallen to 42%, numbers that more closely reflected the actual outcome.[citation needed] Newsweek described Gibson's win as a combination of running as a Republican in ""perhaps the most conservative [district] in the state""[Note 1] and Murphy having supported ""the two biggest items on Nancy Pelosis agenda"", regardless of the fact that ""the National Journal had characterized his voting record as one of the 10 most moderate in the House"".[14]
Gibson took part in a televised debate with Murphy on October 21, presented by the local PBS station, WMHT.[15] Gibson began the campaign at 17 points behind in the polls but ended up winning the election with 55% of the vote.[16]
Gibson, who was redistricted from the 20th district to the 19th district, defeated former federal prosecutor and Ulster County Democratic Party chairman, Julian Schreibman. Gibson was endorsed by all the major newspapers in the district, including the Albany Times Union,[17] the Kingston Daily Freeman,[18] the Poughkeepsie Journal, and the Oneonta Daily Star.
Gibson was challenged by Democrat Sean Eldridge in the general election. During the campaign, he reiterated his pledge not to serve more than four terms in office.[19] He won re-election with 65% of the vote to Eldridge's 35%.[20]
After winning the election in 2010, Gibson was sworn into office in January 2011 as part of the 112th Congress. He immediately voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Gibson joined nearly all other Republican members of the US House of Representatives in voting to support The Path to Prosperity, the budget put forward by U.S. Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI).[21]
The next year he joined nine other Republicans in voting against Ryan's budget, and he supported the Cooper-LaTourette Budget, loosely based on the President's Fiscal Commission Simpson Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force. Gibson said he wouldn't re-sign Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but he remains opposed to raising tax rates.[22] After Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee hit the 20th District in 2011, Gibson focused on getting federal aid to his constituents.[23]
Gibson has made a name for himself focusing on local issues like expanding access to broadband and better treatment of Lyme disease. He held a forum on Lyme disease in Saratoga Springs that attracted 500 people, including patients, medical experts, and environmental professionals.[24] He has been an advocate for passage of the 2012 Farm Bill, even signing a discharge petition to bring the bill to a vote in the House.[25]
Gibson supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.[26]
On January 5, 2015, Gibson announced that he would not run for re-election in 2016.[27] He said that he might run for statewide office in 2018, when the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Comptroller and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand's Senate seat will be up for election.[28][29]
On same sex marriage, he supports equal protection of unions and believes that the decision on marriage should be left to religious institutions, protecting religious freedoms. Given that federal and state law is currently wildly inconsistent, he recently called on the Supreme Court to provide clarity for equal protection and religious freedom.[30]
Following his swearing in, Gibson became a member of the following House committees:[31]
He is a member of both the Conservative Republican Study Committee and the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership
Gibson lives in Kinderhook with his wife, Mary Jo, and their three children. The family is Roman Catholic and attends St. John's Catholic Church in Valatie.[32]

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 21st for his first two terms, is located in the heart of the Capital District and includes Albany, Schenectady and Troy. Tonko previously represented the 105th District in the New York Assembly from 1983 to 2007.
Tonko was president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, from 2007 until his resignation on April 25, 2008,[1] in which he declared his candidacy for Congress shortly after.


Tonko is a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, New York, near Schenectady. He holds a degree in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering from Clarkson University. He is of Polish descent.[2]
Tonko was a member, and subsequently Chair, of the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors. He also worked for a brief time as an engineer for the New York State Department of Public Service.
He represented the 105th District, which comprises Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Princetown, Mohawk, Glen and part of Schenectady.[3]
Incumbent Democratic Assemblywoman Gail Shaffer resigned from her seat to become the New York Secretary of State.[4] Tonko ran for the seat in an April 1983 special election against Republican Eugene Hallock, and won with 54% of the vote.[3][5] He won re-election 15 more times. He never won re-election with less than 62% of the vote.[6]
Tonko was also the major advocate of ""Timothy's Law"" to require health insurers to cover mental illness.[7]
Assemblyman Tonko was a chief sponsor of the Northeast Dairy Compact,[8] the Chairman of the Legislative Commission on Rural Resources,[9] and was appointed by Speaker Sheldon Silver to serve as Commissioner for the Mohawk Valley Heritage Corridor Commission.[citation needed]
Tonko vacated his seat on June 29, 2007 to become the President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as NYSERDA.
While in the Assembly, Tonko served as the Chairman of the Energy Committee, a position he held from 1992 until retirement. Tonko was also a member of standing committees on Agriculture, Transportation and Education, where he was the original sponsor and a chief proponent of the College Tuition Savings Program that was signed into law in 1997.[10]
Tonko was President and CEO of NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority) from 2007 to 2008, when he resigned to run for U.S. Representative.
Tonko entered the 2008 Democratic Primary for New York State's 21st Congressional District after 10-term incumbent Michael McNulty (with whom he served in the State Assembly from 1983 to 1989) decided to retire.[11] Despite having less money than both his main rivals, Tonko won the primary on September 9, 2008 with a plurality of 40% of the vote.[12][13] He ran against Republican James Buhrmaster, a Schenectady County legislator, in the general election.[13]
Democrats outnumber Republicans in registration in the district by a count of 174,054 to 119,493, with 101,219 not enrolled in any party and a total of 428,655 Voters Registered as of March 1, 2008. As such, it was generally believed Tonko had assured himself of a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary.
On November 4, 2008, Tonko won in a landslide, with over 60% of the total vote.[14] ""Tonko's name recognition ... accomplishment in the Legislature, such as the passage of mental health parity legislation, and his record"" contributed to his win.[14] According to preliminary figures the day after the election, he beat Burhmaster by 105,313 to 57,086, with Philip Steck, a minor party candidate, receiving 5,025 votes.[14]
In 2010, Tonko ran for re-election on the Democratic, Working Families and Independence Party lines. He was challenged by Republican and Conservative Party nominee Ted Danz, a former United States Navy Reservist and small business owner in the cooling and heating business. Congressional Quarterly rated the race as ""Safe"" for the incumbent party to keep the seat.[15] Tonko raised almost $980,000, and spent almost $780,000 on his campaign; Danz raised about $44,000 and spent about $42,000 for his own campaign.[16][17] The seat was rated by The New York Times as being ""Solid Democratic"" with ""99.8%"" to ""100% chance"" that Tonko would win the seat.[17] The major issues in the 2010 race were Tonko's ""yes"" votes for the Health Care Bill, the Stimulus Package (ARRA), and the Energy Bill.[17] The Albany Times Union endorsed Tonko in that race, citing ""a way of thinking and speaking like the engineer that he once was"" and his support of the economic stimulus bill and health care bills.[18]
Tonko won the general election on November 2, 2010, by a vote of 124,889 to 85,752.[19]
Tonko was challenged by Republican Bob Dieterich, senior vice president at First National Bank of Scotia. Former Tonko opponent Jim Buhrmaster cited Albany, particularly the city, as the biggest challenge for a Republican contender. He added, however: People are voting more independently, and theyre not registering Republican or Democratic.[20] Tonko won re-election with about 62% of the vote.
Tonko was challenged by Jim Fischer in the November 2014 election. He won his fourth term with 59% of the vote.[21]
Tonko was one of the 19 most liberal house members, according to the National Journal, for 2011.[22]
When he entered Congress, Tonko said he wanted to focus on the issue he said he knows best  energy policy.[23] He sponsored a bill to get $800 million research program in wind energy technologies, which would benefit GE in his district. He also wanted to create a research program to improve the efficiency of gas turbines used in power generation systems that convert heat into energy. In 2010, Tonko got a provision in a House-passed bill, following the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, to prevent future spills and help small businesses in spill research. In 2011, he sponsored an amendment seeking to protect the Environmental Protection Agencys authority to regulate carbon emissions.[24]
He is strongly against expanding the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income earners. Among other key votes, he voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010,[25] Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,[26] American Clean Energy and Security Act,[27] and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[28] He voted against the Republicans' budget.[29]
Tonko has contributed blog posts to the Huffington Post, with many sharply criticizing the Republican Party, including their ""budget hypocrisy"" and the threat they pose to Social Security. He praised the 2011 State of the Union address, saying: the President set out a bold agenda for our nation, an agenda that will focus on growing our economy, growing jobs, and growing opportunity for the middle class.[30] On numerous occasions, he has also warned of the threat that would allegedly be posed by the healthcare repeal to small businesses, to young people, and to seniors.[31]
Tonko has also worked to raise awareness about the region's waterways, chiefly the Hudson and Mowhawk rivers, and the effects of recent flooding following Hurricane Irene. Seeking a comprehensive flood mitigation and economic development strategy, Tonko introduced the Hudson-Mohawk Basin Act in 2012.[32]
He was actively involved in floor debates against the United States federal government shutdown of 2013."

Hanna (born January 25, 1951)[1] is an American politician who has served as a U.S. Representative from New York since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. His district was numbered the 24th during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the 22nd district.


Hanna was born in Utica and raised in Marcy. His grandparents owned a dairy farm in Herkimer County. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from Reed College with a bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction.[2] Hanna is of Lebanese descent.[3]
In 2008, Hanna ran against incumbent Democrat Mike Arcuri and narrowly lost. In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won.
Due to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new 22nd district in 2012.
In his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat Dan Lamb, television stations WUTR in Utica and WSYR in Syracuse announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, ""He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected."" Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna did not say he would pull his ad dollars."" The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been ""nothing more than a courtesy call"". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was ""using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency.""[4][5]
Hanna is a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee and the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership. He is a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus.[6] U.S. Congressman Hanna has stated his opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He is one of only six House Republicans in the 112th Congress who have not signed Grover Norquist's ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" with a spokesman explaining that ""Rep. Hanna is focusing on the pledges he has made to his wife, the Constitution of the United States and the people of upstate New York.""[7][8]
According to the Washington Posts congressional votes database, Hanna has voted with the House Republicans 85% of the time in his first year in office. Only 11 Republicans (out of 244) have a lower percentage.[9]
The first bill Hanna co-sponsored was H.R. 4 which repealed the 1099 tax reporting provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. President Obama signed the bill into law in April 2011.[10] In early 2011 Congressman Hanna voted to repeal health care reform.[11] Hanna voted to support the Energy Tax Prevention Act which would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases and implementing a ""cap-and-trade"" system through regulation.[12] Hanna voted against cuts to NPR and Planned Parenthood.[13] Hanna voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.[14]
In the 2012 presidential election, he endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman.[15]
Hanna supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.[16]
In 2013, he has endorsed same-sex marriage, becoming only the second current Republican member of congress to do so (the other being Ileana Ros-Lehtinen).[17] Rep. Hanna was also a co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity by covered entities (employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, or joint labor-management committees, but exempts religious organizations) nationwide. New York already has already passed similar legislation into law within the State of New York, but the practice remains legal in 29 U.S. states. But Rep Hanna is one of several Republican co-sponsors of the bill who refused to sign a Discharge Petition on the bill  a parliamentary maneuver that allows a majority of members of Congress to bring any bill to the floor, even if the leadership opposes doing so.
In June 2013, Hanna voted against proposed legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of rape or incest who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific.[18]

Reed II (born November 18, 1971) is the U.S. Representative for New York's 23rd congressional district. He served as the Mayor of Corning, New York and is a member of the Republican Party.


Born to Tom and Betty Barr-Reed in Joliet, Illinois, Reed is the youngest of twelve children. His father was a decorated United States Army officer who served in World War II and the Korean War, and died when Reed was two years old. Reed was raised by his mother in Corning, New York. He graduated from Horseheads High School in 1989 and then received his bachelor's degree from Alfred University in 1993. Reed is a member of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. While at Alfred he was a NCAA Division III All-American as a swimmer before attending Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law where he graduated with a law degree in 1996.
After receiving his law degree Reed worked as an associate attorney in the Litigation Department at Gallo & Iacovangelo in Rochester. After his mother passed away in 1999 he returned to Corning and opened his own law firm. His businesses would grow to include real estate, mortgage brokerage, and a debt collection businesses that employ twenty-five people.[1][2]
Reed defeated incumbent Democrat Frank Coccho in 2007 and served one two-year term as mayor.[3] Reed represented the Republican, Conservative, and Independence parties on the mayoral ballot.
Tom Reed announced his intent to run against Democrat Eric Massa on July 1, 2009 in a seven stop announcement tour.[4][5] Midway through his first term in Congress Eric Massa announced that he would not seek reelection due to health problems. Later sexual harassment allegations would emerge and Eric Massa resigned.[6]
In the election to replace Eric Massa in the United States Congress Reed was challenged by Democrat and Working Families Party nominee Matthew Zeller.[7] Reed received the endorsement of Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks and every county Republican chairman in New York's 29th congressional district.[8] He was not opposed in the Republican primary; two opposing candidates filed, but neither qualified for the ballot.
Reed won the election and immediately assumed the unexpired term of Rep. Eric Massa in Washington.[9] In the immediate days following Reed's election, the Congressman-elect suffered a pulmonary embolism.[10] After a three-day delay Reed would be sworn in during a special ceremony.
New York lost two seats because of redistricting and the State Legislature had to redraw the Congressional map. The 29th Congressional District was eliminated and the much of the district became the 23rd Congressional District. The new 23rd Congressional District includes Allegany, Cattaragus, Chemung, Ontario, Schuyler, and Steuben County from the old 29th Congressional District with the addition of Chautauqua, Seneca, Tompkins, and Tioga counties.[11]
Three candidates, Leslie Danks Burke, Melissa Dobson and Nate Shinagawa, campaigned in a Democratic primary to challenge Rep. Tom Reed in New York's 23rd congressional district.[12]
Reed won reelection against Democrat and Working Families Party nominee and Tompkins County Legislator Nate Shinagawa.[13]
Reed faced Tompkins County Legislative Chair Martha Robertson. Though it was predicted to be a close race,[14] Reed won handily.
Upon election to Congress, Reed was appointed to the House Judiciary Committee and House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.[15]
During his first term, Reed co-founded with Mark Critz the bi-partisan Marcellus Shale Caucus, a work group to conduct an open discussion and debate on Marcellus Shale issues.[16]
Five months into his first term, Speaker John Boehner and Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier appointed Reed to the House Committee on Rules.[17] An unusual position for a freshman member, Chairman Dreier called his appointment a testament to his vision and commitment to changing the way Congress does business.[17] In order to serve on the Committee on Rules, Reed relinquished his assignment on the House Judiciary Committee and took a leave of absence from the House Transportation Committee.[18]
Only two months later Dean Heller was appointed the United States Senate following the resignation of Senator John Ensign leaving an opening on the House Ways and Means Committee.[19] Following the recommendation of Speaker John Boehner and Ways and Means Chairman David Camp the Republican Steering Committee voted to recommend Reed for the vacant position.[20]
During his first term in Congress, Reed proposed a resolution that would install a national debt clock on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.[21] Reed also focused on bringing attention to wasteful government spending and supported budget amendments that saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by eliminating government funding for projects, including a sewer system in Tijuana, Mexico.[22][23] He also voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and supported the Budget Control Act of 2011.[24][25]
After his reelection to Congress, Reed drafted the Promoting Assistance with Transitional Help Act. The bill would modify the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) program by introducing a 5-year limit on welfare payments to individuals. The TANF program was originally intended to provide temporary assistance to needy families but had deviated from that mandate and in some states provided indefinite cash benefits to individuals. Reed hopes that requiring the program to provide only temporary emergency relief will reduce dependence on government assistance.[26]
In 2013, Reed offered amendment 103 to the House Farm Bill (H.R. 1947), which would have imposed a lifetime ban on food assistance through SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for life for people convicted of certain violent offenses.[27] Of the 1.6 million people in state or federal prison, about one in six were convicted of offenses targeted by this amendment, with African Americans and Latinos disproportionately affected.[28]
On August 2, 2013, Reed introduced the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2013 (H.R. 2996; 113th Congress), a bill that would establish the Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program (NMIP) within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).[29][30] Under the program, NIST would award grants to establish a network of centers of innovation to improve the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers.[29]
With government shutdown looming Reed introduced the Pay Our Veterans and Seniors First Act. The legislation would ensure that armed services members were paid and that seniors continued receiving benefits during a temporary government shutdown. The bill also forfeited pay for Congress and the President for the duration of the government shutdown.[31][32]
In 2014, Reed introduced the Clinical Trial Cancer Mission 2020 Act. The bill would make it mandatory for researchers to publish all information from cancer clinical trials, with the goal being to get more researchers to work together and bring down the number of duplicative studies. The legislation would create a national clearinghouse run by the NIH.[33] It would also make it so that any researcher who received a grant from the government for their research, and did not comply with the law's requirements to publish all clinical trial information, would have to return the grant money.[34] Congressman Chris Collins (R-NY) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY) cosponsored the bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[35] Reed announced the bill at the Arnot Health Falck Cancer Center.[36]
On May 22, 2014, Reed introduced the Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to permanently extend and expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced tax deduction for businesses that donated their food inventory to charitable organizations.[37][38] Reed argued that it makes sense to make this a permanent measure because ""doing it on a temporary basis... is part of the problem. We need to make this sound policy permanent in the tax code and I'm optimistic we'll get it to the finish and allow people to take advantage of the tax deduction that would encourage them to use the food rather than put it in a the landfill.""[39]"

"281","","1987","1929","New York 25","University of Kentucky","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Slaughter","Louise Slaughter","Democratic","Monroe County Legislature, New York State Assembly","Episcopalian","Dorothy Louise Slaughter (ne McIntosh; born August 14, 1929) is the United States representative for New York's 25th congressional district, serving since 1987. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 30th District from 1987 to 1993 and the 28th District from 1993 to 2013, is based in Rochester and includes most of surrounding Monroe County Formerly the Chairwoman of the House Rules Committee from 2007 until 2011, she has served as ranking minority member of the Committee since 2011, a post she also held from 2005 to 2007.[citation needed]


Slaughter was born Dorothy Louise McIntosh, one of five children born to Oscar Lewis McIntosh, a blacksmith for a coal mine, and Daisy Grace McIntosh on August 14, 1929 in Lynch, Kentucky, a coal mining town built by a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. She had two brothers, Philip and David as well as two sisters, Marjorie and Virginia. Her sister Virginia died[when?] of pneumonia while she was a child; Slaughter later cited this as her reason for earning degrees in microbiology and public health.[citation needed]
The family moved to Monticello, Kentucky, where Slaughter attended high school. After graduating from high school, she enrolled at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, where she studied microbiology. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she went on to earn a master's degree in public health, also from the University of Kentucky.[citation needed]
After graduate school, she went to work for Procter & Gamble in New York doing market research. Already involved in community groups like the Scouting in New York and the League of Women Voters, Slaughter became increasingly concerned with local political and community issues. She was involved in a local environmental group, the Perinton Greenlands Association, which promoted recycling and opposed development of Hart's Woods. Slaughter decided to run for the Monroe County Legislature, winning on her third try. In 1975, while in the county legislature, she accepted an offer from then- New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo to serve as his regional coordinator in the Rochester area. When Cuomo was elected lieutenant governor in 1979, Slaughter stayed on as his Rochester regional coordinator.
In 1982 local Democratic supporters approached Slaughter with a desire to see her run for the New York State Assembly against the Republican incumbent Thomas A. Hanna, whom she subsequently defeated by a narrow margin. In 1984, she was re-elected by the more substantial margin of 10 points. She sat in the 185th and 186th New York State Legislatures.
After four years in the state assembly, Slaughter decided to run for the Democratic nomination in New York's 30th congressional district. At the time, the district included downtown and eastern Rochester, most of eastern Monroe County, all of Genesee County and northern Livingston and Ontario counties. Moderate Republican Barber Conable had represented the district for 20 years before giving way in 1985 to a considerably more conservative Republican, Fred J. Eckert. Slaughter managed a one-point victory in the 1986 midterm election. Slaughter was the first Democratic representative to represent the 30th District since 1910, the first woman to represent Western New York, as well as the first Democratic representative ever elected to a full term from the 30th since its creation in 1893. It had been renumbered several times in the previous century.
Redistricting after the 1990 census renumbered Slaughter's district as the 28th District. She lost her share of Genesee, Livingston, and Ontario counties, but picked up the rest of Rochester and more of Monroe County. The redistricting put her into the same district as 30-year incumbent Republican Frank Horton, a close friend of Slaughter's. The district had already been moving away from its moderate Republican roots, but the new territory made the district solidly Democratic. Horton opted to retire, though he would have been a heavy underdog against Slaughter in any case. She has been reelected seven more times since then.
After the 2000 census, much of her district was merged with the 29th District of fellow Democratic Representative John LaFalce, which included Niagara Falls and the northern portion of Buffalo. Original plans called for LaFalce's district to be merged with that of Republican Jack Quinn, who represented the other side of Buffalo. The new district retained Slaughter's district number, but was geographically more LaFalce's district. Only a thin tendril in Orleans County connected Rochester to Buffalo. However, LaFalce did not seek a 15th term, effectively handing the seat to Slaughter. With her election in 2002, she became the first woman to represent a significant portion of Buffalo in the House.
Following the 2010 census, Slaughter's district was renumbered as the 25th District. It was significantly more compact than its predecessor, as it took in most of Monroe County and lost its territory near Buffalo. However, it was also slightly less Democratic than her former territory. While President Barack Obama carried the old 28th with 68 percent of the vote, he would have carried the new 25th with 59 percent of the vote. She faced a vigorous and well-funded challenge from Republican Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks, but Slaughter won a 14th term with 57.4% of the vote, on November 6, 2012.
Slaughter ran for another term in the election held on November 4, 2014, and narrowly won re-election, defeating her Republican opponent, Mark Assini, by 869 votes. After an extended period of vote counting, Assini conceded defeat on November 12, 2014, more than a week after the election was held.[1][2]
In January 1987, Slaughter entered Congress. In 1993, as a member of the United States House Committee on the Budget Slaughter secured the first $500 million earmarked by Congress for breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health. Slaughter was also a co-sponsor of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, and fought to ensure the legislation included language guaranteeing that women and minorities were included in all federal health clinical trials from that point forward.[3] Previously, all NIH-funded research was done on white males, even in trials related to predominantly female diseases such as breast cancer.[4] Slaughter fought to include language establishing an Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH in the legislation. Ten years after the creation of ORWH, the National Institutes of Health awarded Slaughter it's ""Visionary for Women's Health Research"" award.[5]
In 1994, Slaughter co-authored the Violence Against Women Act which is designed to reduce incidences of domestic violence in the United States and provide resources to victims. During that same year, she wrote legislation to make permanent the United States Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women.[citation needed]
Along with Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), she introduced the Women's Progress Commemoration Act which established the Women's Progress Commemorative Commission in 1998.[6]
In early 2005, she authored the Fairness and Accountability in Broadcasting Act, which would reinstate the Fairness Doctrine. Along with Democratic Congressman John Conyers, in April 2006 Slaughter brought an action against President George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case (Conyers v. Bush) was ultimately dismissed.[citation needed] After the 2006 mid-term takeover of the House by the Democratic Party, Slaughter was chosen to serve as Chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules at the start of the 110th Congress. She is the first woman in history to chair the Rules Committee.[citation needed]
In 2007, Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), which would limit the use of antibiotics in livestock feed, to counter the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria.[7] She has reintroduced her legislation in every subsequent session of Congress. The legislation would phase out the use of 8 major classes of antibiotics in healthy food-producing animals, while allowing their use for treatment of sick animals.[8]
Slaughter declared that ""the greatest thing she has done in her time in Congress"" is passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. She introduced and reintroduced this bill for 12.5 years, and could claim victory when the bill was signed into law on May 21, 2008. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is designed to prohibit discrimination by employers or health insurers based upon an individual's genetic information.
In 2009, Slaughter wrote to the United States Department of Defense requesting an investigation into faulty body armor after reading an article in The New York Times, entitled, ""Pentagon Study Links Fatalities to Body Armor."" The article authored by Michael Moss reported that up to 80 percent of Marines who were killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had extra body armor. Slaughter's request resulted in the Department of Defense launching an investigation, recalling 16,000 pieces of body armor and replacing them with safer armor.[9]
As Chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules, Slaughter was heavily involved in the writing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and managed the rule for the legislation on the House Floor. Slaughter was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funding for elective abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.
In March 2010, Slaughter proposed that a House rule be passed to expedite the passage of health care reform legislation. The rule allows the House to deem the Senate version of the health care reform bill ""already passed"" by the House without the House holding a recorded vote on the bill. Critics, who called the strategy the ""Slaughter Solution"", charged this proposed strategy was an affront to democratic principles and challenged its constitutionality.[10] Ultimately this legislative strategy was never used to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the House.[11] Supporters observe that the courts have affirmed the rule's constitutionality, and that Republicans have used the rule repeatedly to pass major legislation such as the Patriot Act and the Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.[12][13][14]
On March 19, 2010, two days before the health care vote, a window in Slaughter's Niagara Falls office was broken with a brick.[15]
In 2011, Slaughter secured $62.5 million in federal funding for the laser lab at University of Rochester. Slaughter's efforts to secure funds for her district was recognized by the Rochester Institute of Technology when it named its Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies facilities in her honor. During the same year, with the potential of a government shutdown looming, Slaughter referenced H.R. 358, introduced by Rep. Joseph Pitts during the 112th Congress,[16] when she said at a pro-choice rally, ""This is probably one of the worst times that we've seen because the numbers of people who are elected to Congress. I went through this as co-chair of the Arts Caucus. In '94, people were elected simply to come here to kill the National Endowment for the Arts. Now they're here to kill women"".[17][18][19]
After the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, Slaughter suggested the Federal Communications Commission was ""not working anymore"", and called for better policing of incendiary language.[20]
During the 112th Congress, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, which Slaughter first authored and introduced into Congress in 2006[21] - was passed into law.[22] The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by Members of Congress and other government employees. It confirms changes to the Commodity Exchange Act and specifies reporting intervals for financial transactions.[citation needed]
Slaughter is one of the most liberal and progressive members of the New York congressional delegation from upstate New York, and in the 110th Congress, was the most progressive member of the entire House of Representatives according to the National Journal.[23]
Among representatives from upstate New York, only now retired fellow Democratic Representative Maurice Hinchey had a lower lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union.[citation needed]
Slaughter is one of several Democratic congresspersons who post at Daily Kos, a Democratic-oriented blog. She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She is currently the oldest woman currently serving in Congress, followed by United States Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA-D), who is four years younger than Slaughter.
Slaughter serves on the Democratic Steering & Policy Committee. She is the Democratic Chair of the Congressional Arts Caucus and the bipartisan Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus. Slaughter also serves as Co-Chair of the Future of American Media Caucus and is former Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. After Democratic Representative Martin Frost, the ranking member on the House Rules Committee, was defeated for reelection, Slaughter was appointed to fill this position, becoming the first female member of Congress to serve in this post. After the 2006 election, she became the first woman to chair this committee.[citation needed]
While traveling for work, she met Robert ""Bob"" Slaughter, in San Antonio, Texas, and later married him. After marrying, the couple moved to Fairport, New York, a suburb of Rochester, where Bob had been offered a job. The couple have three daughters: Megan, Amy and Robin, and seven grandchildren. Robert ""Bob"" Slaughter died in May 2014, aged 82.[24]
Slaughter is a distant relative, through Daniel Boone, of former Missouri Democratic Congressman Ike Skelton.[25]

In 1993, during his final year on the Council, Higgins was rated Buffalo's Best Lawmaker in a 1993 Buffalo News Survey of Western New York business and community leaders.[3][5] Responding to the survey were 158 business, community, and government leaders in Western New York.[5] Higgins earned the highest rating of any political leader with a 3.81 out of a possible score of 5.[5] The Buffalo News stated in regard to Higgins being named top lawmaker, ""During his 5 1/2 years on the Council, he has earned a reputation as a thoughtful, soft-spoken lawmaker who has paid attention to both district and citywide concerns.""[5] One community leader stated, ""Brian is a very bright, responsible public official,""[5] while a government leader is quoted, saying of Higgins, ""The best Councilman in Buffalo. Has great vision.""[5]
Higgins graduated from Buffalo State College with a B.A. in political science in 1984.[1][2][3] He later received an M.A. in history from Buffalo State College in 1995,[1][3] and an M.P.A. from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1996.[1][2][3] Higgins has also instructed courses on state and local government, and the economic history of Buffalo and Western New York, in the departments of history and economics at Buffalo State College.[3] Further, he served as the 145th District representative to the New York State Assembly from 1999 through 2004.[1][3][6]
Higgins has positioned himself as a centrist.[6] He describes himself as ""the most independent and conservative Democrat in [the] New York"" delegation.[6] He ran for the Assembly on both the Democratic and Conservative party lines, and in the House, he often agrees with Republicans on issues regarding national security, immigration, and gun control.[6]
Higgins is a member of the New Democrat Coalition.[6] He describes himself as a pro-union moderate who wants to spur job growth. He has said he supports allowing seniors to buy prescription drugs from Canada, and that one of his priorities in Congress will be to push for legislation allowing the government to negotiate for volume discounts on drugs. He has also said he wants Congress to repeal President George W. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.
He procured $279million over 50 years for Erie County's various governments and agencies from the New York Power Authority as part of the Niagara Power Project 50-year relicensing agreement.[8][9] Higgins is an advocate for economic development and job creation, and played a pivotal role through his membership on the House's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in securing approval for the construction of a new federal courthouse in downtown Buffalo.[10]
Higgins strongly advocates for increased federal funding for cancer research,[11] as Buffalo is home to Roswell Park Cancer Institute,[12] the nation's first major medical facility devoted exclusively to treating cancer, with cancer research as its main mission.[13]
Higgins has also been active in efforts to secure peace in Northern Ireland.[14] In 2006, Higgins and Congressmen James T. Walsh and Tim Murphy met with several government leaders in Ireland in which there was a confirmation announcement of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) weapons decommissioning.[14] Government leaders with whom the three congress members met included Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain, US Ambassador to Ireland James C. Kenny, US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Robert H. Tuttle, and the leadership of each of the main political parties involved in the process for peace.[14]
Regarding Higgins' visit to Ireland in association with the peace talks, Higgins stated on his congressional website on January 20, 2006:
Higgins has also supported efforts for peace in South Asia and Africa, and the Middle East, including places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Darfur.[2]
In 2007, Higgins reportedly played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in saving St. Joseph's Hospital in Cheektowaga from closure as proposed by the New York State Commission on Health Facilities in the 21st Century. For 2007, Higgins received an ""A+"" on the 2007 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues from the Drum Major Institute, which describes itself as ""providing the ideas that fuel the progressive movement.""[15]
Higgins was named by several media outlets as one of the leading candidates to replace Hillary Clinton in the United States Senate after she became Secretary of State in an Obama Administration.[6][16] He was one of six candidates on New York Governor David Paterson's ""short list"" for the position; a Web poll conducted by WKBW-TV showed 75% of respondents on the station's website would support Higgins being nominated. In the end, Paterson instead appointed Hudson Valley Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand. On January 31, 2009, Higgins led a delegation of Western New York elected leaders in welcoming Gillibrand to the region, moderating an economic roundtable discussion held at the Bioinformatics Center of Excellence, located on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.[17]
In December 2008, after only two terms in the House of Representatives, Higgins secured a spot on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means,[6] considered to be one of the most important and powerful committees in Congress due to its wide jurisdiction. Higgins was subsequently appointed to serve on the Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, as well as its subcommittee on Oversight.[18] Since the GOP takeover of the House following the 2010 midterm election, Higgins left the Ways and Means Committee (while maintaining a right to return) and became a member of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on Homeland Security.[2][6] On the latter, Higgins quickly rose to the position of Ranking Member of the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence.
On a previous policy position from his website, Higgins said, ""For too long, the Social Security Administration has underfunded and understaffed hearing offices in Western New York...citizens who have contributed to the Social Security system throughout their lives should have proper customer service when their benefits come due.[19]
In addition, Higgins, along with many other congressional members, sent a letter to President Barack Obama encouraging him to keep social security, and make it stronger, saying We write today to express our strong support for Social Security and our view that it should be strengthened. We oppose any cuts to Social Security benefits, including raising the retirement age. We also oppose any effort to privatize Social Security, in whole or in part...cutting Social Security benefits beyond the already scheduled increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 would create even more needless hardship for millions of vulnerable Americans. This was in response to President Obama giving the task of cutting government spending to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, on October 15, 2010. The letter also stressed that Social Security is prohibited by law from adding to the national budget deficit.[20]
Higgins, therefore, is a protector of Social Security and is against privatization of it.[21] Further, he ""support[s] full funding for the Social Security Administration to process checks on time; fight against waste, fraud, and abuse; and combat unacceptable claims backlogs.""[21] Higgins' district includes nearly 150,000 senior citizens.[21]
Serious about accountability regarding the nation's Social Security Administration, Higgins introduced related legislation, House Resolution (HR) 3997, in February 2014.[22] The bill is aimed at requiring the Social Security Commissioner to submit an estimated annual budget; to submit the estimated budget to Congress prior to first submitting it to the President; to prohibit the closing or limitation of field offices and hearing offices without justification; following particular procedures related to closings, consolidations, and/or public limitations; and other requirements.[22]
While serving in the New York State Assembly from 1999 to 2004, Higgins consistently voted pro-life.[23] Since running for Congress in 2004, Higgins identifies himself as pro-choice.[24] In 2006, Higgins was given a rating of 9% by the NRLC, which indicates a pro-choice stance. Higgins received a score of 100% (a perfect score) from Planned Parenthood in 2012 and from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2011.[25]
Higgins voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In June 2012, Higgins said he believed that health care providers will have to embrace ""Accountable Care Organizations, comparative effectiveness research  which studies various treatments to determine what works best  and other changes. He believed that this should have been done decades ago.[26]
On his congressional website, Higgins has stated that ""there is no question that [the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] was needed.""[27] He further stated that it is a beginning of health care reform in the United States.[27]
Higgins strongly believes in a national healthcare program, with a public option, a plan in which the government provides healthcare which would compete with other businesses plans. A letter written by a group of representatives to Senator Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, which Higgins signed stated, As the Senate continues to work on health reform legislation, we strongly urge you to consider including a public option.""[28] The American Public Health Association gave Higgins a perfect rating of 100% in 2009.[29][30][31]
It was reported that Higgins was proposing something unprecedented in this era of $1.3trillion annual deficits: a $1.25trillion, five-year plan to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges, railroads, ports and airports.[32] Higgins' congressional website states the monetary figure as $1.2trillion for these endeavors.[33] The bill, entitled the Nation Building Here at Home Act[33] and based on research by the New America Foundation,[33] would cost significantly more than President Obama's $787billion stimulus package.[32] Higgins said that he wants to rebuild the US ""as we've rebuilt other countries - Iraq and Afghanistan - in recent years.""[32] He also stated that it is not a stimulus bill, but a ""nation-building bill.""[32][33][34]
Higgins is a supporter of education, including early education through higher education.[35] Higgins has stated, ""Every child has a right to a quality education.""[35] Ensuring that young people have a quality early education, and that legislators are supportive of education for individuals in primary, elementary, secondary, and higher educational institutions are among Higgins' aims.[35] Higgins is a proponent regarding congressional support for measures that increase student achievement, but which also reward success rather than punish failure, as the No Child Left Behind Act has done.[35] Higgins further believes that financial barriers to education should not hinder any individual from pursuing higher education.[35]
Higgins supports maintaining lower interest rates on loans incurred by college and university students.[35][36][37][38][39] Higgins cosponsored two bills, H.R. 3826 and H.R. 4816, in efforts to extend the period of time in maintaining the reduced 3.4% interest rate on student loans.[38][39] The College Cost Reduction and Access Act was also supported by Higgins in 2007, a bill passed into law that included the reduced 3.4% interest rate on subsidized Stafford student loans through the end of the 2012 academic year.[38][39]
Jack Quinn, a moderate Republican who had represented the heavily Democratic 27th since 1993, unexpectedly announced his retirement in 2004. In April 2004, Higgins entered the race, and narrowly defeated then-Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples. Even after redistricting following the 2000 census, the district was made slightly friendlier for Quinn (in part, by adding mostly rural Chautauqua County), but was still at the time the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The district has since reverted to form, and Higgins has been reelected three times against Republican opposition, with 2008 and 2010 opponents having posted six-figure fundraising numbers.[40][41] In both 2006 and 2008, Higgins garnered more than 70% of the vote.
For his first four terms, Higgins represented the southern two-thirds of Buffalo, as well as Chautauqua County. Higgins' district was drawn by the federal special master to be much more compact and Democratic in the 2012 redistricting. He picked up all of Buffalo, as well as several inner-ring suburbs that used to be in the territory of Louise Slaughter, and returning Chautauqua County to its traditional Southern Tier district. He also picked up several communities in Niagara County, including all of North Tonawanda and all but a handful of residents in Niagara Falls.
Higgins has received financial contributions for his campaigns from many business executives in Western New York throughout his tenure in Congress.[42] In 2012, Higgins' re-election committee raised more than $1,000,000, with approximately 2/3 of that amount coming from individual donors, representing major businesses in Western New York.[42]"

University of Alabama at Birmingham","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Collins_(American_politician)","Chris Collins","Republican","Erie County Executive","Roman Catholic","Christopher Carl ""Chris"" Collins (born May 20, 1950) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party who has been the United States Representative for New York's 27th congressional district since 2013. Previously, he was the County Executive of Erie County, New York from 2007 to 2011. He is a resident of Clarence, New York.[1]


Born in Schenectady, New York, in 1950, Collins moved around the country with his family as his father was transferred several times by General Electric.[2] Collins graduated from Hendersonville High School in Hendersonville, North Carolina, in 1968[3] and was inducted into the Hendersonville High School Hall of Fame in 2013.[4] He received a BSME from North Carolina State University in 1972 and an MBA from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1975.[1]
Collins spent thirty-five years in the business world.[citation needed] As an entrepreneur he was the founder, President and CEO of Nuttall Gear Corporation located in Niagara Falls, New York.[1] Nuttall Gear was a 1983 leveraged buyout of the Westinghouse Electric Gear Division located in Buffalo, New York.[5] Collins sold Nuttall in 1997 to a large industrial conglomerate.[5]
After losing a race for Congress in 1998, Collins purchased or invested in over twenty bankrupt and financially troubled companies. These companies were combined into several platform companies. His current companies include: Bloch Industries, Easom Automation, Innate Immunotherapeutics, Mead Supply, Oxygen Generating Systems Intl., Schlyer Machine, Volland Electric and ZeptoMetrix Corporation.[6]
U.S. Congressman Bill Paxon (R-NY) convinced Collins to get into politics and challenge 24-year incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman John J. LaFalce in New York's 29th congressional district.[citation needed] During the campaign, Collins was one of the first congressional candidates to call for President Bill Clinton's resignation in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.[7] LaFalce touted his own record of bringing home the bacon[8] and he was re-elected by 58% to 41%.
Collins ran for Erie County Executive in 2007 on the platform of smaller county government, lower taxes and Six Sigma.[9] His campaign slogan was ""Elect a Chief Executive, not a Chief Politician."" Collins defeated Democrat James P. Keane, the Deputy County Executive of the Dennis Gorski administration, with 63% in what was considered an ""upset"" win.[10]
On November 8, 2011, Collins lost his bid for re-election, a race he was predicted to win.[11] He was defeated by Democratic candidate Mark Poloncarz, the Erie County Comptroller.[12] In a county with 140,000 more Democrats than Republicans, Collins won 39 of the 44 municipalities. Poloncarz won the 5 remaining municipalities, most importantly the City of Buffalo, by a margin of 81% to 19%.[11]
When Collins became the County Executive, he inherited from his Republican predecessor, Joel Giambra, a nearly bankrupt county that had state-imposed fiscal control with a budget of $1.2 billion.[9][10]
Collins spoke for 3 minutes at the 2008 Republican National Convention on September 3, 2008.[13] He was the only County Executive in the country given the opportunity to speak at the RNC.[citation needed]
Collins reduced overall county debt by over $120 million and created a cash surplus in excess of $100 million.[14] He reduced county employment by over 1,200 employees (22%)[14] and fully paid Erie Countys state imposed pension costs without borrowing.[14] Collins reverted the state imposed Fiscal Control Authority to advisory status in 18 months [15] and received approval of a Four Year Financial Plan (2012-2015) that further reduced county debt by another $100 million.[16]
Collins reopened every bridge, road, park and beach that had been closed under previous administration, including rebuilding the historic toboggan runs in Chestnut Ridge Park in Orchard Park.[16][17]
As Erie County Executive, Collins recruited a Six Sigma Master Black Belt from the University at Buffalo who had previously worked as an executive at a Delphi to implement Lean Six Sigma across all county departments under the direction of the County Executive to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The positions $115,000 salary plus associated costs was funded by a grant of tax-payer money from the Erie County Control Board.[18]
He laid off almost 1,000 workers[9] and effectively repealed the countys Apprenticeship Law.[19]
Collins sued the county so that he could unilaterally increase the county attorney's salary by more that $50,000 than the amount authorized by the County Legislature.[20] The State Supreme Court Judge presiding over the case ruled in favor of Collins and awarded the higher salary to the incoming County Attorney.[21]
Collins was sued by the United States Department of Justice for repeated civil rights violations of prisoners held in county facilities, including juveniles and prisoners with developmental disabilities.[22] The Department of Justice and Erie County co-signed a stipulated settlement of dismissal in August 2011.[23]
He was also sued by the County Legislature for refusing to issue payments to Erie Community College which had been included in the County's budget.[24]
As County Executive, Collins created the Brighter Future Fund, donating his county salary to local non-profit organizations for the first 18 months of his tenure.[25]
In February 2008, Erie County experienced a potential Hepatitis A emergency when an infected employee handled produce at a popular supermarket.[26] Over the course of several days, the County vaccinated and inoculated 10,000 people to protect the public. The event was one of the largest vaccination events in the history of the United States.[26]
One year later, tragedy struck Erie County when Continental Flight 3407 crashed in a residential neighborhood, killing all 49 passengers on board, one person on the ground in Clarence Center. Collins declared a State of Emergency. Throughout the night and over the next several days, Collins worked to ensure the cooperation of Erie County departments and other government agencies in the recovery, investigation and family support efforts.[27]
In the summer of 2009, southern Erie County  especially the Village of Gowanda  was devastated by flooding. Dozens of homeowners lost the contents of their basements and first floors. Collins mobilized the Countys Emergency Services and Public Works departments to assist local governments in their recovery efforts.[28] Erie County also successfully lobbied the Federal government to provide FEMA aid dollars to both local governments and individual homeowners.[citation needed]
During his lame duck period as Chief Executive, Collins proposed spending $6m to upgrade housing for polar bears at Buffalo Zoo at the same time as laying off 155 workers.[9]
Beginning in 2009, Collins was mentioned as a potential candidate for Governor of New York in the 2010 election, particularly if Rudy Giuliani decided not to run.[29][30][31] Collins had indicated he would make his decision in January 2010, but observers believed he was strongly leaning toward running.[32] After further pondering, Collins decided not to run on January 26, 2010. He cited a desire to focus on his current job and a lack of fundraising support from downstate donors, which he dubbed the ""status quo."" He did not endorse Rick Lazio and encouraged the state party to find someone else, either from the business field or possibly cross-endorsing Democrat Steve Levy.[33]
Before his re-election defeat, Collins was mentioned as a potential candidate in the 2014 gubernatorial election.[10] After his election to Congress, Collins was again mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate. In January 2013, he said that he had ""no intention or interest in running for governor in 2014"".[34]
After losing his County Executive re-election campaign, Collins ruled out a future bid for office. In January 2012, he was reported to be considering running for Congress[11] and on March 25, 2012, Collins announced he was running in New York's newly-drawn 27th Congressional District. The district had previously been the 26th District, and had long been a Republican bastion. However, in a 2011 special election, Democratic Erie County Clerk Kathy Hochul became the first Democrat to represent the district in over 40 years.
On June 26, 2012 Collins won the Republican primary, defeating Iraq War veteran David Bellavia 60%-40%. Collins had the Republican and Conservative party lines for the November general election and defeated Hochul 51%-49%,[35] a difference of 4,312 votes.
Collins won re-election to a second term by defeating Democratic opponent Jim O'Donnell 72%-28%.[36]
Collins was sworn-in on January 3, 2013. Prior to taking the oath of office, House Republican leadership appointed him to serve on both the Agriculture and Small Business committees in the 113th Congress.[37] Soon after taking office, House Small Business Committee Chairman Sam Graves tapped Collins to chair the subcommittee on Healthcare and Technology.[38]
On March 20, 2014 Collins chaired a field hearing, titled Expanding Broadband Access and Capabilities to Small Businesses in Rural New York.[39][40] This field hearing was held at the Orleans County Legislature in Albion, NY, examining access to broadband in rural communities, and the role of the federal government in expanding these capabilities to small businesses.[41] Following the field hearing, Collins hosted a roundtable discussion with local community leaders to continue the discussion on the importance of access to broadband in rural communities. [42]
In announcing his committee assignments, Collins said one of his top goals as a member of Congress would be to work with his colleagues to pass a new Farm Bill.[43] On May 15, 2013 Collins voted to approve the 2013 Farm Bill.[44][45] Subsequently, on January 29, 2014 Collins voted to approve the Conferenced Farm Bill, known as the Agricultural Act of 2014.[46] President Obama signed the 5 year Agricultural Act of 2014 into law on February 7, 2014.[47]
On June 5, 2013 Collins was asked to join the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. This assignment made Collins the member of three congressional committees, a rarity among members of Congress.[48]
Collins has been critical of the federal Veterans' Administration since taking office. Collins has said the VA has been unresponsive to several of his concerns and that the agencys track record is unimpressive. He has called for a top-to-bottom review to address such matters as the massive disability claims backlog and the misuse use of insulin injection pens.[49] Due to the inappropriate use of single use insulin injection pens at the VA hospital in Buffalo, it was reported that 20 veterans tested positive for hepatitis.[50] Following this news, Collins called for the resignation of Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki.[51][52]
In response to a proposal by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo to provide state prison inmates with a publicly financed college education, Collins introduced the Kids Before Cons Act in February of 2014.[53] The bill would prohibit states from using federal funding for the purpose of providing a college degree to convicted criminals. Collins called the Governor's proposal an insult to law abiding taxpayers who are struggling to put themselves or their children through college.[54] Collins' bill does allow federal dollars to be used for GED and working training programs in prisons and correctional facilities. Cuomo later abandoned his proposal to use public money to fund his initiative.[55]
On May 1, 2014, Collins and Congressman Kurt Schrader (D-OR) sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and Department of the Army Secretary John M. McHugh voicing concerns with a proposed rule to expand the definition of navigable waters under the Clean Water Act. Two hundred and thirty-one (231) House Members co-signed the letter (212 Republican and 19 Democrats) demanding the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers abandon the proposal because of the negative impact it would have on American farms.[56][57] Collins and Schrader's effort was supported by the American Farm Bureau.
In October 2009, Collins compared Sheldon Silver, the Jewish speaker of the New York State Assembly, with Adolf Hitler, Napoleon and the Antichrist. Collins apologized for his comments.[59]
In January 2010, a Republican Assemblyman claimed that at a crowded gubernatorial address, Collins told a woman that ""I'm sure if you offer someone a lap dance you can find a place to sit.""[60] Collins denied making the statement attributed to him.[61] These two controversies were widely seen as the reason he did not run for Governor of New York in 2010.[10][33]
Collins made national news due to an interview published in The Batavian on June 24, 2012, in which he said: ""People now dont die from prostate cancer, breast cancer and some of the other things. The fact of the matter is, our healthcare today is so much better, were living so much longer, because of innovations in drug development, surgical procedures, stents, implantable cardiac defibrillators, neural stimulators -- they didnt exist 10 years ago."" [62] In response, The Huffington Post wrote, ""An estimated 577,190 people in the United States will die from cancer this year, including about 39,920 deaths from breast cancer and 28,170 from prostate cancer,"" citing data from the American Cancer Society.[63] ArtVoice wrote, ""The implantable cardiac defibrillator and neural stimulators, or TENS devices, were both invented and patented in the late 60s or early 70s; therefore, they existed '10 years ago'."" [64]
After the national media picked up the story, Batavian publisher Howard Owens defended Collins: ""On its face, the opening part of the quote from Collins sounds outrageous, but in context, clearly Collins misspoke. More likely, he meant to say: Fewer people die from prostate cancer, breast cancer and some of the other things."" [65]
In February 2014, Collins introduced the Kids before Cons Act, which would prohibit the use of federal money to provide college education to convicted criminals in prison. An editorial in the New York Times said, ""These ridiculous arguments are unmoored from both reason and reality."" The investment would have paid for itself many times over. A 2013 RAND study of 30 years of research found that every dollar spent on inmate education saves $4 to $5 on re-incarceration.[66]"

Butterfield","Democratic","North Carolina Supreme Court Justice","Baptist - ABCUSA","George Kenneth ""G. K."" Butterfield, Jr. (born April 27, 1947) is the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 1st congressional district, elected in 2004. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is located in the northeastern corner of the state, stretching from Durham to Elizabeth City and including all or parts of 24 counties. In 2015, he became chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
An attorney, he served as Resident Superior Court judge for North Carolina (1988-2000) and as a state Supreme Court justice, the latter from 2001-2004.


Butterfield was born and raised in a prominent African-American family in Wilson, North Carolina, the son of Addie Lourine (ne Davis) and George Kenneth Butterfield, both of mixed race.[1] Butterfield's father immigrated to the United States from Bermuda.[2]
Described by the Washington Post as an ""African-American who appears to be white,""[3] Butterfield acknowledges he has European as well as African ancestry, and that he identifies as African American. He has noted that he grew up on the ""black side"" of town and led civil rights marches.[4] He is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Butterfield graduated from Charles H. Darden High School. He earned degrees in political science and sociology from North Carolina Central University (NCCU).[5] In 1974, he received a Juris Doctor degree from the NCCU School of Law.[5]
Butterfield served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1970.[6]
In 1988, Butterfield was elected as Resident Superior Court judge in the first judicial division. For the next twelve years, he presided over civil and criminal court in 46 counties of North Carolina.[5] In February 2001, he was appointed to the North Carolina Supreme Court by Governor Mike Easley.[5] In 2002, Butterfield lost his seat on the Supreme Court but returned to the Superior Court bench by special appointment of Governor Mike Easley and served in that position until his retirement in May 2004.[5]
Butterfield was first elected to the House of Representatives in a special election in 2004, to fill the seat of Frank Ballance.
Butterfield serves on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and formerly served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. He is the Region VIII representative on the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.
Beginning in 2007 in the 110th Congress, Butterfield was chosen to serve as one of eight Chief Deputy Whips; they assist in the formulation of Democratic policy and ensure the passage of legislation by maintaining good communication with members. He was appointed to this position by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.[5]
As a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, G.K. Butterfield advocated for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.[8] Butterfield supports ""a market-based approach to capping carbon emissions""[9] and wants to broaden the United States' sources of energy.[10] On his website, Butterfield stresses the need to find more clean and domestic sources of energy.[9]
A strong supporter of civil rights, he advocated renewal of the Voting Rights Act and ""introduced a bill calling for the Capitol Visitor's Center to acknowledge the slave labor used to build the Capitol.""[3]
In 2009, Butterfield introduced the Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite Act ""to assist states in carrying out inspections of lodging facilities, train inspection personnel, contract with a commercial exterminator; educate owners and staff at lodging facilities.""[11] Butterfield also passed H.R. 4252 ""To amend the Small Business Act to change the net worth amount under the small business program for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals from $750,000 to $978,722, and for other purposes.""[12]
Butterfield supported the Affordable Health Care Act, and worked with the Energy and Commerce Committee to help write the legislation.[13] During the discussion of the bill in Congress, Butterfield complained about the lack of cooperation from the Republican party.[13]
Butterfield supports increasing taxes for higher-income families while decreasing taxes for middle and low-income families.[13] Although he is an advocate for using government stimulus in order to improve the economy, Butterfield wants to reduce government regulations on the private sector.[13]
In 2008 Planned Parenthood gave Butterfield an 80 percent ranking. In 2009 Butterfield supported the interests of NARAL Pro-Choice America 100 percent of the time.[13] Butterfield identifies as pro-choice and especially supports legalized abortion when the life of the woman is in danger or if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.[13]
Butterfield has repeatedly voted against defining marriage as being between one man and one woman, voting against the Marriage Protection Act of 2004 and constitutional marriage amendments in 2004 and 2006. He has voted to ban job discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2010 voted for the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell.[14]
Butterfield voted in 2008 against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) $700 billion bailout of the financial industry and the $14 billion rescue package for the auto industry.[15]
In 2011, he voted to extend expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act[16] and voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012.[17]
In 2012, Butterfield introduced legislation that, if passed, would require more input from the public before tolls are introduced on roads. His legislation is in response to the ""No toll on I-95"" group, which is a Roanoke Rapids-based group that opposes instating a toll on I-95. Opponents of the toll argue that it leads to double taxation, and say it is the first time ""the federal government has put tolls on an existing interstate.""[18]
On July 23, 2014, Butterfield introduced the joint resolution Approving the location of a memorial to commemorate the more than 5,000 slaves and free Black persons who fought for independence in the American Revolution.[19] The joint resolution would approve the location of a commemorative work to honor the more than 5,000 slaves and free black persons who fought in the American Revolution.[20]
Butterfield was elected to Congress in a special election on July 20, 2004 (see above.) to fill the unexpired term of Representative Frank Ballance, who resigned for legal reasons. He defeated Republican candidate Greg Dority and Libertarian Party nominee Tom Eisenmenger. Butterfield was sworn into office on July 21, 2004.
On July 20, 2004, Butterfield won the Democratic primary entitling him to run in the November 2004 general election. Running against Dority again, he won his first full term with 64% of the popular vote.[21][22]
Butterfield was unopposed for reelection in 2006.
Butterfield won against Dean Stephens with 70.28% of the vote.[23]
Originally endorsing John Edwards for the presidential primary,[24] in January 2008, Butterfield endorsed Barack Obama for the primary and general election.[25]
Butterfield defeated Republican nominee Ashley Woolard.
Butterfield sought re-election in 2012; the district was expected to strongly favor Democrats.[26]
In April 2012, Butterfield accompanied President Obama to speak at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to speak about extending the current interest rates on federal loan program for many undergraduate students. Butterfield expressed concern with the pending expiration, saying: Allowing the current interest rates to expire would burden students with additional debt, prolong their ability to kick start their careers, and send the message that it is more important to cut taxes for the wealthy than educational expenses for our young people.[27]
In 1971, Butterfield married Jean Farmer. They have two daughters, Valeisha and Lenai, who are now adults.[5] He and Jean divorced in 1991. Jean is now a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives representing House District 24. Their daughter Valeisha is married to former NBA player, Dahntay L. Jones. They have one child together, Dahntay, Jr. In addition, Butterfield is the father of an adult daughter, Tunya Michelle Butterfield. Tunya and her partner have twin sons, Gavin and Chase.
G.K. Butterfield is a lifelong member of Jackson Chapel First Missionary Baptist Church in Wilson, North Carolina, where he has served as Trustee and Chairman of the Finance Ministry.[5] He is also a member of Groove Phi Groove Social Fellowship, Incorporated.[28]"

She is a member of the Republican Party. Ellmers defeated seven-term Democratic incumbent Bob Etheridge in 2010 by 1,489 votes, confirmed after a recount.


Ellmers was born Renee Jacisin in Ironwood, Michigan, the daughter of Caroline Pauline (ne Marshalek) and LeRoy Francis Jacisin. Her father was of Czech and French-Canadian descent and her mother was of Croatian and Polish ancestry.[2] She moved to Madison Heights as a child, when her father got a job in the automobile industry. She graduated from Madison High School.[3] Ellmers paid her way through Oakland University by working various jobs, training as a medical assistant.[4] In 1990, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.[5][6] Ellmers worked as a nurse in Beaumont Hospital's surgical intensive care unit. In North Carolina, she was clinical director of the Trinity Wound Care Center in Dunn.[3]
Ellmers became involved in politics after the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which she opposed. She became involved in local Republican politics and joined Americans for Prosperity, a free-market political advocacy group.[5] She sought the Republican Party nomination for Congress in North Carolina's 2nd congressional district, which was then held by seven-term incumbent Bob Etheridge. She faced car dealer Todd Gailas and retired businessman Frank Deatrich in the May 4, 2010 Republican primary. She raised and spent more money than her opponents. She won the Republican primary with 55% of the vote, winning every county in the district except Franklin.[5][7][8]
In June, a physical altercation between U.S. Congressman Bob Etheridge and two young men claiming to be students working on a project [9] was posted to the internet.[10] The previously obscure Ellmers was highlighted by conservative blogs such as RedState and the National Review's The Corner.[11] Donations increased markedly,[12] and a SurveyUSA poll showed Ellmers ahead by one percent[13] [5] Ellmers received an endorsement from former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin on August 18 through Facebook, citing Ellmers' experience in the health care industry.[14] Palin endorsed Ellmers along with three other women, on the 90th anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States.[15]
On election day, November 2, 2010, Ellmers was declared the winner by the media and a recount conducted on November 17 and 18 confirmed that she defeated Bob Etheridge during the general election by a margin of 0.8% or 1,483 votes.[16][17]
The Republicans won control of the General Assembly in the 2010 election as well, and used the redistricting process to shore up the 2nd for Ellmers. They pushed the district well to the west to take in some heavily Republican territory between Raleigh and Greensboro. The two sections were connected by a narrow tendril through Fayetteville. While Barack Obama won the old 2nd with 52 percent of the vote--one of the few majority-white districts in the South that went for Obama--John McCain would have carried the new 2nd with 57 percent of the vote.
Three Republicans decided to challenge her in the primary, but all of them were first-time candidates. She won the May 8 primary with 56% of the vote.[18] In the November general election, Ellmers defeated Democratic nominee Steve Wilkins, a retired US Army officer and Moore County businessman, 56%-41%.[19]
Ellmers considered running for the U.S. Senate in 2014,[20] but instead ran for re-election. In May 2014 primary she faced conservative Internet talk show host Frank Roche, who campaigned mainly against her support of immigration reform.[21] Ellmers easily won the nomination, capturing 58% of the vote to Roche's 41%.[22] American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken won the Democratic nomination after a close primary.[23]
In September 2011, Ellmers told students at Campbell University that she opposed a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and civil unions because it was too broad. A spokesman said ""Congresswoman Ellmers has always believed that marriage is a sacred institution and is defined as the union between one man and one woman...As a voter, she would vote against a piece of legislation that would add a ban on civil unions to the protection of marriage since they are two different issues and should be dealt with separately.""[24] It was reported in July 2014 that she told a meeting of Republican women, ""Men do tend to talk about things on a much higher level, Ellmers said. Many of my male colleagues, when they go to the House floor, you know, theyve got some pie chart or graph behind them and theyre talking about trillions of dollars and how, you know, the debt is awful and, you know, we all agree with that.... We need our male colleagues to understand that if you can bring it down to a womans level and what everything that she is balancing in her life  thats the way to go, Ellmers concluded.[25]
She supported the Budget Control Act of 2011 saying ""It's not 100 percent of what many of our very conservative colleagues want, but it is about 70-75 percent. This is not about who's the most conservative. This is about common sense.""[26]
Ellmer serves as the current chairwoman of the Republican Womens Policy Committee.[27] In 2015, she led five other Republican women in opposing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.[citation needed]
Ellmers met her husband Brent Ellmers, a surgeon, while working at Beaumont Hospital. After the birth of their son Ben, the family moved to Dunn, North Carolina, where Ellmers and her husband ran a practice.[5]
Renee Ellmers claims to be a ""family values"" Republican with Christian values. She says on her website, ""As a mom, Christian and nurse, my beliefs have deepened through experience... I am pro-family."" [28]"
"286","","1995","1943","North Carolina 3","Atlantic Christian College","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_B._Jones,_Jr.","Walter Jones","Republican","North Carolina House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","Walter Beaman Jones, Jr. (born February 10, 1943) is the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, serving since 1995. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district encompasses the Outer Banks and stretches from areas near the Pamlico Sound down to Wilmington. Jones' father was Walter B. Jones, Sr., a Democratic Party congressman from the neighboring 1st district.


Walter B. Jones Jr., is the son of former US representative Walter Sr. (19131992), and Dot Long Jones (19141984).
Jones is a lifelong resident of Farmville, a small town near Greenville, North Carolina. He attended Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, and graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts from Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College) in Wilson, North Carolina before serving four years (19671971) in the North Carolina National Guard. He worked as an executive with his family's business supply company.[citation needed]
Jones was first elected as a Democrat to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1982 and served for five terms, until 1992. He represented Pitt County.[1] He was known in the North Carolina House for his advocacy of campaign finance reform and lobbying reform.[2][3][4]
Shortly after his father died in 1992, Jones ran for his father's seat in North Carolina's 1st congressional district. He ranked first in the Democratic primary with 38% of the vote,[5] but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win the nomination. In the run-off election, he was defeated by Eva Clayton, Chairwoman of the Warren County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 55%45%.[6] Clayton received support from three of the defeated primary candidates and from the African American community.[7]
In 1994, he switched parties and ran in North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, which had absorbed a large chunk of his father's former territory. His race against incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster was initially very close until Jones released a picture of Lancaster jogging with President Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stands (especially on gays in the military) angered many voters in the district.[8] Although Democrats have a large advantage in registered voters, the 3rd has always had a very strong social conservative tint; Jesse Helms in particular had a large base of support here. As part of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Jones defeated Lancaster 53%47%.[9] With his victory, Jones became the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.[citation needed]
Since 1994, he has won re-election with at least 61% in every general election. His most serious general election challenge came in 2000, when his opponent spent well in excess of $1.4 million in attempting to unseat him.[citation needed] Jones garnered 61% of the vote in that contest,[10] largely helped by George W. Bush winning the 3rd with his highest victory margin in the state.
He was easily re-elected to a 7th term in 2006, receiving 69% of the vote despite a very bad result for Republicans overall.
Jones' change of heart on the Iraq War (see below) resulted in him facing serious primary opposition for the first time since his initial run for Congress. He was challenged by Onslow County Commissioner Joe McLaughlin. Jones defeated poorly funded McLaughlin 59%41%.[11] In the general election, Jones defeated Craig Weber 66%34%.[12]
In the general election, he defeated Johnny Rouse with 73% of the vote.[13]
He faced Frank Palombo, a former New Bern police chief in the Republican primary on May 8 and won.[14] He won against Marine Corps Veteran Erik Anderson in the general election.[15]
He faced Taylor Griffin, a former aide to President George W. Bush, who was heavily supported by outside money, on May 6 and won the Republican Party primary.[16]
Jones has a lifetime rating of 84.69 from the American Conservative Union. However, his voting record has become somewhat more moderate in recent years according to the group's ranking. In recent years, he has received some of the lowest ACU ratings of any Republican from the South. In 2006, he received a 79, in 2007 he received a 71, in 2008 he received a 58, in 2009 he received an 83, in 2010 he received a 65, and in 2011 he received a 60.[17][18][19][20][21][22] The former five ratings were the lowest recorded in those years for a Republican from North Carolina.
Jones said that his father was able to vote his conscience until he became a member of the House Democratic leadership, at which time he had to vote with the party line. For instance, his father voted for the 1975 federal bailout of a bankrupt New York City even though he personally opposed it. Jones said of that vote, ""He had to vote it that way. I would rather do what I think is right than to sell my political soul.""[2] Jones drifted towards the libertarian spectrum when he changed his positions on foreign policy including the Iraq War.
Jones opposes pork barrel spending projects[2] and is a staunch advocate of federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[23] and voted for H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[24] In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined ""unlawful Internet gambling"").
Jones has sided with the Democrats on economic issues such as raising the minimum wage. He is an animal lover and has said he would like a memorial created on the National Mall for war dogs.[2] Jones endorsed Ron Paul in the 2008 race for president of the United States.[25] In an annual survey conducted by Washingtonian magazine, Congressional staffers voted Jones the kindest member of the House.[2]
In 2007, Jones cosponsored legislation with fellow North Carolina congressman Heath Shuler to require airlines to have sections of the aircraft where large movie screens were not visible. This was to avoid the situation where children could watch films potentially objectionable by their parents.[26] He also was the only Republican co-sponsor of legislation to challenge Tom DeLay's proposed changes to House ethics rules.[2]
On February 14, 2008, Rep. Jones was one of only three Republicans (along with Ron Paul and Wayne Gilchrest) to vote to hold George W. Bush confidantes Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers in contempt of Congress for failing to testify and provide documents relevant to the firing of federal prosecutors. On September 15, 2009, Jones was one of only seven Republicans to vote for a resolution of disapproval of fellow Representative Joe Wilson for his actions during President Obama's address to a Joint Session of Congress on September 9, 2009.[27]
Jones presents the Walter B. Jones Campus Defender of Freedom Award to a North Carolina activist selected by a committee at Duke University, including the Duke College Republicans; in 2009, Jones presented the award to B.J. Lawson.[28] At the 2009 ceremony, Jones said that ""The Republican Party needs to have a face that can be seen and identified with by people of all races. The future of the Republican Party lies in being able to relate to the average working family.""[28] He also spoke in favor of making Duke's endowment more transparent, saying that he is in favor of more openness on the part of institutions: ""To me, sunshine is the answer.""[28]
On April 15, 2011, Jones was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against The Path to Prosperity.[29] In December 2012, Jones was one of four House Republicans removed from their committees by Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor for defying party leadership. Jones was removed from the Financial Services Committee, a plum seat for fundraising, ostensibly as reprisal for not raising money for the Republican Party.[30] However, it was speculated that Jones, who is popular in the caucus, was only removed as ""cover"" for the removal of Justin Amash of Michigan, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and David Schweikert of Arizona from their own plum committee assignments, who were removed for being ""assholes"".[31] Westmoreland concluded, ""some people ... just dont want to work within the system.""[32]:p.2 Jones maintained his seat on the Armed Services Committee.
Jones was initially a strong supporter of the conflict in Iraq, but then became one of the leading Republicans opposed to continued involvement in Iraq. Jones became well known for leading the effort, along with GOP Rep. Bob Ney, to have french fries renamed ""freedom fries"" in House cafeteria menus as a protest against French opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[33] Jones later modified his stance on the war to a considerable extent. In 2005, he stated that he had come to believe that there had been little reason to go to war, despite his earlier support, which had been based upon selective intelligence supplied to Congress. He said of his previous position on the fries, ""I wish it had never happened.""[34] In July 2006, the names were quietly changed back.[35]
On March 17, 2005, he sponsored a bill endorsing the conduct of his Camp Lejeune constituent, controversial Marine Corps Lieutenant Ilario Pantano, who faced charges (subsequently dropped) for having shot two Iraqis (allegedly unarmed civilians) on April 15, 2004.[36]
Jones called on President George W. Bush to apologize for misinforming Congress to win authorization for the war. Jones said, ""If I had known then what I know today, I wouldn't have voted for that resolution.""[37]
He contends that the United States went to war ""with no justification.""[2][34] On the subject, he said, ""I just feel that the reason of going in for weapons of mass destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that's all been proven that it was never there."" He added that his change of opinion came about from attending the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006.[38] Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq.[2] He said, ""If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong. Congress must be told the truth.""[2]
In 2007, he and Rep. William Delahunt (DMA) introduced the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, which seeks to ""prohibit the president from ordering military action without congressional approval, except when the United States or U.S. troops were attacked or when U.S citizens needed to be evacuated.""[39]
On January 12, 2007, he introduced H. J. Res. 14: Concerning the use of military force by the United States against Iran in the 110th congress.[40] According to Jones on his web site, the resolution requires that  absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces  the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[41] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCA) on March 13, 2007.[42]
On March 23, 2007, Jones was one of two Republicans to vote for a bill that would require President George W. Bush to bring combat troops home from Iraq by September 1, 2008. The other Republican was Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland's 1st congressional district.[43]
Jones' views on the war in Iraq did not ingratiate him to Bush or to the Republican leadership, which prevented him from succeeding the late Jo Ann Davis as ranking Republican on the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee. He was passed over for Randy Forbes when the 110th Congress convened because the full committee's ranking member, Duncan Hunter of California, didn't agree with Jones' change of heart on the war.[44] He had been approached by some Democrats about bolting the GOP and either becoming an independent caucusing with the Democrats or switching back to the Democratic Party outright.[45]
Additionally, Jones' changed views on the war and other issues angered many Republicans in his district, which has the largest military presence of any in North Carolina.[2]
On March 7, 2012, Jones introduced House Concurrent Resolution 107, proposing that Congress should consider waging wars without an Act of Congress as grounds for impeachment of the President for High Crimes and Misdemeanors according to the Constitution of the United States of America.[46]
He is the author of Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act (H.R. 126;113th Congress).[citation needed]
Jones serves on the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of libertarian-minded Republican congressional representatives.[47] Congressman Ron Paul originally hosted a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday. The caucus is now hosted and chaired by Congressman Justin Amash. Other members included Jim Duncan of Tennessee, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, and Jeff Flake of Arizona.[48]
Jones was raised a Southern Baptist but is a Roman Catholic convert. [2][49]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes portions of, among other cities, Burlington, Fayetteville, Raleigh, Durham, and all of Chapel Hill.


Born in Erwin, Tennessee, Price attended Mars Hill College in Mars Hill, North Carolina when it was a junior college.[1] He later transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, after winning a scholarship, and became a member of The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies. He earned a degree in 1961.[1] Originally intent on becoming an engineer,[1] Price continued his education at Yale University where he received a theology degree (1964) and a Ph.D. in political science (1969).[2]
He served as an aide to Alaska Senator Bob Bartlett from 1963 to 1967 and then entered academia, working as a political science and public policy professor at Duke University from 1973 until his first campaign for Congress in 1986.[2] He also served as a Duke professor during 1995 and 1996, when he was not in Congress.[2]
Price worked for the North Carolina Democratic Party from 1979 to 1984.[2] Price has written a political science textbook entitled The Congressional Experience, from the perspective of a candidate for office, and then, a member of Congress.
Price also served as executive director and then state chair for the North Carolina Democratic Party prior to being elected to Congress.[1]
Price first entered Congress in 1987 after defeating one-term Republican U.S. Congressman Bill Cobey 56%-44%.[2][3] Price won re-election in 1988 and 1990 with 58%.[4][5] In 1992, he won re-election with 65%.[6]
In 1994, he was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger and former Raleigh police chief Fred Heineman, who won by a margin of less than 1%[7] during the Republican Revolution, in part to lower-than-expected turnout in the Democratic stronghold of Orange County[citation needed] (home to Chapel Hill), but despite the fact that heavily Republican Randolph County had been eliminated from the Fourth District during redistricting prior to that election year.[1]
In 1996, Price defeated Heineman in a rematch 54%-44%.[8] He was helped in part by voters who were not happy with the lack of progress made by the freshman class on the goals of the Contract with America.[9]
The district has since reverted to form, and Price won re-election by wide margins in 1998 (57%), 2000 (62%), 2002 (61%), 2004 (64%), and 2006 (65%).[10]
Price's opponent in the 2008 election was Republican B.J. Lawson. Lawson was called the most formidable opposition Price has faced since he was defeated by Heineman in 1994.[11] For example, he ran television ads, which Price's opponents hadn't done in at least a decade.[12] Despite increased efforts and expenditures by his Republican opponent, Price still defeated Lawson 63% to 37%.[13]
On September 8, 2010, Price launched his reelection campaign. Price defeated Lawson in a rematch 56% to 44%.[14]
Price defeated Republican nominee and businessman Tim D'Annunzio.
He was an early opponent of the Iraq War of 2003[15] and has sponsored a bill to bring the conduct of private military companies working in Iraq under legal jurisdiction of the United States.[16] He has also introduced legislation to prohibit contractors from performing interrogations of prisoners in the custody of intelligence agencies.[17]
As chairman of the 2008 House subcommittee responsible for determining the budget for the Department of Homeland Security, Price was seeking to focus immigration enforcement efforts on criminal convicts.[18][19]
Price authored a provision of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 which made the interest on student loans tax deductible,[20] and legislation creating the Advanced Technological Education program at the National Science Foundation, which provides grants for high-tech education in community colleges and was enacted in 1993.[21] Price voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[22] reasoning that ""the harmful effects of the credit crisis on all North Carolinians were too great for the federal government to sit on the sidelines.""[23] and for ""[defending] critical emergency management and homeland security priorities"" was honored with an award by the association of state emergency managers.[24] In December 2009, he voted for the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which enacted more stringent regulations on the financial industry in order to protect consumers and taxpayers from another financial crisis.[25]
Price is the author of legislation to reform the public financing system for presidential campaigns.[26]
Price has opposed concentration of media ownership. He worked on legislative initiatives to roll back the FCC's 2003 rules [27] and co-sponsored an (unsuccessful) bill to overturn another 2008 FCC approval of media consolidation [28] Price voted for the 2006 ""Markey amendment"" to establish network neutrality in the Communication Act of 1934 [29]
In 2013, Price voted against the amendment to the Patriot Act that would have eliminated Section 215 and curtailed the National Security Agency's controversial data collection program.[30]
Price also serves as Chairman of the House Democracy Assistance Commission, which works through peer-to-peer partnerships with emerging democratic legislatures to assist in the development of the fundamental building blocks of legislative government.[31]
Price married his wife, Lisa Kanwit, in 1968. They were longtime Democratic Party activists together,[1] and they have two children: Karen, a filmmaker; and Michael, a professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Brunel University in London.[2] They have two grandchildren, Charles Albert, born in 2006, and Margaret Elizabeth, born in 2009.[2] Today, Price resides in Chapel Hill[1] and is a member of the Binkley Memorial Baptist Church.
Price appeared as a contestant on the nighttime version of the CBS game show Password, which aired on November 28, 1963, while he was a graduate student at Yale. His celebrity partner was Gloria Stewart, wife of James Stewart, and they lost to James Stewart and his contestant partner. Price won a consolation prize of $50.[citation needed]
Price received the 2011 John Tyler Caldwell Award for the Humanities from the North Carolina Humanities Council. [32]

Foxx is a member of the Republican Party and was elected Secretary of the House Republican Conference by her colleagues on November 27, 2012.[3]


Foxx was born in The Bronx, New York to Dollie (ne Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was reared in a rural area of Avery County, North Carolina. Foxx grew up in a poor family and first lived in a home with running water and electricity at 14 years old.[4]
While attending Crossnore High School in Crossnore, North Carolina, she worked as a janitor at the school and was the first in her family to graduate from high school.[5] She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor's degree in 1968 and later earned both a Master of Arts in college teaching (1972) and Ed.D (1985) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.[2][6] With her husband, Virginia Foxx owned and operated a nursery and landscaping business.[6]
Foxx worked as a research assistant and then an English instructor at Caldwell Community College & Technical Institute and Appalachian State University before moving into university administration. From 1987 until her 1994 entry into politics, she was president of Mayland Community College. Under North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, Foxx served as Deputy Secretary for Management.[6] From 1994 to 2004, Foxx served in the North Carolina Senate.[citation needed]
After 5th District Congressman Richard Burr decided he would run for the United States Senate, Foxx was first to join the race for congressman. North Carolina's 5th district is highly partisan. Because of this, the race quickly became one of the most expensive in North Carolina's history.
In contrast to the primary, her general election campaign against Jim Harrell, Jr., which she easily won (59%-41%), was more cordial.
Foxx was briefly targeted for defeat in the 2006 elections, but the Democrats' top choice, popular Winston-Salem mayor Allen Joines, decided not to run. Joines later said that he didn't have the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx.[7] Her 2006 opponent was Roger Sharpe, who was defeated. Roy Carter of Ashe County, North Carolina was Foxx's opponent for her seat in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.
In November 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.[8]
In November 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote defeating ""software developer Josh Brannon of Vilas."" [9]
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against[10] the $51 billion aid package to victims of Hurricane Katrina.
The first bill sponsored by Foxx to have been signed into law since 2006, the Hero Act, signed by President Bush on Memorial Day, 2006, allows U.S. troops to increase their retirement savings by investing a portion of their combat pay into Individual Retirement Accounts.
The second bill sponsored by Foxx and subsequently signed into law is the Electronic Pay Stub Act which gives federal employees the choice of receiving their pay stubs electronically. This legislation is projected to save taxpayers millions of dollars. Studies have shown that it costs 10 times more to purchase and distribute paper stubs than it does to distribute electronic stubs.[11] This bill was signed into law in October, 2008.[12]
Shortly after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Foxx identified a provision in the law that allowed her to force consideration of a measure to deny the second, $350 billion, tranche of the TARP bailout. On November 19, 2008, she introduced H.J.Res. 101, which met all of the parliamentary requirements for consideration once the President requested the second tranche.[citation needed]
In the following (111th) Congress, she reintroduced the measure as H.J. Res. 3, and shortly before leaving office, President Bush requested the second tranche, thereby activating the trigger allowing her to commandeer the House floor, although she was not a member of the majority party. Her measure passed the House 270-155; the act was never addressed in the Senate.[13]
During an interview in 2007, Foxx was quoted as saying: ""We have the best economy we have had in 50 years.""
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, claiming that the murder of Matthew Shepard was not a hate crime. While debating the act at the House of Representatives, she called the murder a ""very unfortunate incident"" but claimed ""we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn't because he was gay."" She ultimately called that allegation ""a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing hate crimes bills.""[14] Media outlets including the New York Times,[15] Washington Post,[16] and Huffington Post[17] criticized her statements. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congressional colleague, did the same.[18] Democratic sources claimed that Matthew Shepard's mother was present at the time of Foxx's statements.[18]
Foxx later retracted her comments, suggesting her use of the word ""hoax"" was in bad taste.[19][20] She suggested that Shepard's murder was a tragedy and that his killers had received appropriate justice.[19]
When commenting on the House version of the reform bill that funds counseling for end-of-life issues, Foxx said, ""Republicans have a better solution that won't put the government in charge of people's health care,"" and ""(The plan) is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government.""[21] She later said that ""we have more to fear from the potential of the Affordable Health Care for America Act passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country.""[22][23]
Virginia Foxx is a member of Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans since 2005. Her son-in-law is a Turkish businessman, Mustafa zdemir.[24][25]
In January 2013, Foxx co-sponsored legislation that would stop children born in the United States to undocumented parents from gaining citizenship.[26]
Before her service in Congress, Virginia and her husband Tom owned a nursery.[31]"

Asked at an event in Rockingham County, if military force was appropriate along the US-Mexican border, Walker stated that the national guard may be necessary to secure the border.[5] At this same event he suggested ""we got to go laser or blitz somebody with a couple of fighter jets for a little while to make our point"" to which the moderator asked if he had any qualms about starting a war with Mexico. Walker responded with ""Well, we did it before, if we need to do it again, I don't have a qualm about it.""[6]

Previously he was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing constituents in Johnston County and Wayne County in the 12th district of the North Carolina Senate.


Rouzer was born in Landstuhl, Germany in 1972. He was raised in Durham, North Carolina where he attended Northern High School (Durham, North Carolina). He then attended North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and earned a professional B.A. in 1994 in three different majors: Agricultural Business Management, Agricultural Economics, and Chemistry. He is also a graduate of the Fund for American Studies' Institutes on Business and Government Affairs and American Economic and Political Systems.[2]
He has been a small business owner of The Rouzer Company and the Warehouse Distribution. From 2001-2002, he was assistant to the Dean at the NC State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. From 2005-2006, he was an associate-rural Administrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[3]
From 1996-2001, Rouzer was a legislative aid and Senior Policy Adviser for U.S. Senators Jesse Helms and Elizabeth Dole. In 2000, he ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture and lost the Republican primary field.
In 2008, incumbent Republican State Senator Fred Smith decided to retire in order to run for Governor of North Carolina. Rouzer decided to run and defeated Nena Reeves in the Republican primary 68%-32%.[4] In the general election, he defeated Kay Carroll 52%  48%.[5] In 2010, he won re-election with 70% of the vote.[6]
David Rouzer receives a majority of his funding from agribusiness, receiving more than $289,000 from this sector in the 2012 congressional elections.[7]
He worked on strengthening laws allowing youths to obtain a drivers license. He is also a proponent for the ""sea-level rise"" legislation in 2012 that sought to mandate that only historical data be used to predict future trends.[8]
He favors repealing the 2010 health care reform law. In the 2012 election he released a TV ad in which his grandmother promises that the candidate would not cut Medicare if elected.[9] Rouzer believes immigrants should be fluent in English before being granted U.S. citizenship. He opposes abortion rights.[8]
In his four years, he has sponsored 17 bills that have become signed into law.[10]
After Republican-controlled redistricting, he decided to give up his state senate seat to run in the newly redrawn North Carolina's 7th congressional district and challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Mike McIntyre. His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the 2nd District.
In the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee Ilario Pantano and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%).[12][13] However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win.
The redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor. Roll Call rates the election as leans Republican.[14]
After an official tabulation showed that Rouzer had lost the election to McIntyre by 655 votes, Rouzer asked for a recount on November 21, 2012. After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28. It was the closest House race in the country. Mitt Romney carried the district with 56 percent of the vote.
Rouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch. Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup. Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time.
Rouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote. Upon taking office in January of 2015, he became only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction."

The district includes several outer portions of Charlotte, as well as many of that city's northern and eastern suburbs. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Pittenger was born in Texas and attended the University of Texas. After graduating he worked for Campus Crusade for Christ before moving to Charlotte in 1985 and becoming a real estate investor.
After redistricting, Pittenger decided to run for the 40th senate district of the North Carolina General Assembly in 2002.[1] He defeated Democratic State Senator Fountain Odom 55%-43%.[2] In 2004, he decided to run for the 39th senate district and defeated Libertarian nominee Andy Grum 89%-11%.[3] In 2006, he won re-election to a third term unopposed.[4]

On December 2, 2013, Pittenger introduced the Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013, which became Pub.L. 113104.[24] The law broadens the coverage of current laws that address domestic assaults by certain repeat offenders.[25] The law also requires the United States Department of Justice to write a report on child abuse prevention laws in all U.S. states and territories, ""with a particular focus on penalties for cases of severe child abuse.""[26] Pittenger said that the bill ""will strengthen laws and help prevent child abuse,"" noting that ""it is sickening to realize that we need such laws.""[26] After the bill's passage, Pittenger called it ""a victory on behalf of children,"" but said that ""no happy, bright, little girl should ever become the face of child abuse legislation.""[27]

He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for a single term. The district is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and includes Hickory, Lincolnton, Shelby, and part of Gastonia.


McHenry was born in Gastonia, North Carolina. He grew up in suburban Gastonia, North Carolina, the son of the owner of the Dixie Lawn Care Company,[1] and attended Ashbrook High School. While at Ashbrook High School, McHenry participated in the Close Up Washington civic education programs. A Roman Catholic, McHenry was the youngest of five children. His parents are now deceased.
Halfway through North Carolina State University, McHenry transferred to Belmont Abbey College.[1] At Belmont, McHenry founded the school's College Republican chapter,[1] then became chair of the North Carolina Federation of College Republicans and served as treasurer for the College Republican National Committee.
His first run for public office was for the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1998, while still a junior in college; he won the primary but lost in the general election. The Democratic winner was the father of a high school classmate.
After earning a B.A. in history in 1999, McHenry worked for the media consulting firm DCI/New Media, in Washington, D.C. He was involved in Rick Lazio's campaign against Hillary Clinton during the November 2000 United States Senate election in New York; his main project was running a Web site, NotHillary.com.[1] In 2012, he received an Honorary M.B.A. in Entrepreneurship from Yorktown University.[2]
In mid-2000, McHenry was hired by Karl Rove to be the National Coalition Director for George W. Bush's successful 2000 presidential campaign.[1] In late 2000 and early 2001, he was a volunteer coordinator for Bush's inaugural committee. After working for six months in 2001 as a special assistant to Elaine Chao, the United States Secretary of Labor in Washington, D.C., McHenry returned to North Carolina and ran again for the state legislature, winning in the November 2002 general election.
A resident of Cherryville, North Carolina, McHenry represented the state's 109th House district, including constituents in Gaston County, for the 20032004 session. While in the legislature, he sat on the House Appropriations Committee.
At age 33, McHenry was the youngest member of the 110th United States Congress; however, 27-year-old Aaron Schock of Illinois took office in the 111th United States Congress in January 2009.[dated info]
McHenry serves on two House Committees: Financial Services, and Oversight and Government Reform. McHenry holds two House Republican leadership positions; he is a Deputy Whip and Vice Chairman of Finance for the National Republican Congressional Committee's Executive Committee.[3]
Since 2011, McHenry has been Chairman of the Subcommittee on TARP, Financial Services, and Bailouts of Private and Public Programs on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In this capacity he has held hearings on municipal bankruptcies and bailouts and the future of TARP.
On May 29, 2014, McHenry called for Eric Shinseki, the Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary, to resign. This was due to ""revelations of mismanagement and mistreatment at VA facilities in Phoenix and across the country."" In a Press Release, McHenry said: """"The treatment of veterans by the Phoenix VA is nothing short of disgusting. These brave Americans have given so much for our country and for them to be subjected to this horrendous treatment is repugnant. After I reviewed yesterday's interim report, it is clear that Secretary Shinseki has failed his most basic responsibility of caring for America's heroes. The report found these issues not to be isolated incidents but rather systemic problems throughout the VA system, a system Secretary Shinseki has led since the President took the oath of office in 2009. In light of these most recent revelations, I believe it is time Secretary Shinseki resign and allow for new leadership that will protect our nation's veterans. While the treatment of veterans uncovered in the report is awful, I must commend the staffs at both the Hickory outpatient clinic and Asheville VA Medical Center who have served the veterans in my district with distinction. I appreciate their service to our veterans.""[4]
In the 109th Congress, McHenry authored legislation which would increase the penalty for anyone who manufactured methamphetamine in the presence of a child. The legislation, H.R. 1616, was incorporated into legislation which passed the House and Senate.[5][6] It was signed into law as part of the Patriot Act reauthorization in March, 2006.[7]
In the 110th Congress, in the Committee on Financial Services, McHenry worked with Rep. Al Green (D-TX) on legislation requiring mortgage lenders to simplify their mortgage disclosure forms for home buyers.[8] Their Mortgage Disclosure Simplification Act was integrated into H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007, comprehensive housing reform legislation passed by the House. It awaits action by the Senate.[9][dated info]
In 2008, McHenry opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined ""unlawful Internet gambling"").
McHenry was honored by the North Carolina Chapters of the American Legion and Marine Corps League after assisting in bringing a Veteran's Community Based Outpatient Clinic to Hickory, a project his predecessor Cass Ballenger had begun before his retirement.[10]
After the passing of Senator Jesse Helms, McHenry sponsored a resolution (H.Res. 608) honoring Helms's life and service.[11] Every member of the North Carolina delegation co-sponsored his resolution, and it was passed by the House of Representatives by unanimous consent.
McHenry authored the Independence Prize Act of 2007 (H.R. 2867), which would authorize a prize of up to $1 billion to an American company or individual who invented a transformative source of energy to replace fossil fuels.[12] McHenry also co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation designed to open drilling for oil in the outer continental shelf and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as well as increased use of nuclear and clean coal energy.[13][broken citation][14]
On March 2, 2010, McHenry proposed new legislation, H.R. 4705, that would redesign the face of the $50 bill to include the likeness of the 40th President, Ronald Reagan.
The House passed two bills sponsored by Congressman McHenry in 2011. The first terminated the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The second was the Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act, commonly referred to as Crowdfunding and was introduced to foster relationships between investors and entrepreneurs. Specifically, it permits crowdfunding issuances that offer an equity stake (securities) to investors. In 2012, McHenry's Entrepreneur Access to Capital bill was integrated into the larger JOBS Act (H.R. 3606), which was passed by the House on March 8, 2012. The bill was also passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Obama on April 5, 2012.
McHenry stirred further controversy with his remarks on April 1, 2008, regarding a trip to Iraq. Speaking to 150 Republicans attending the Lincoln County GOP Dinner, he called a contractor  reported first by blogs as a ""U.S. soldier""[15]  performing security duties in Iraq as ""a two-bit security guard"" because the contractor denied McHenry access to a gym.
We spent the night in the Green Zone, in the poolhouse of one of Saddams palaces. A little weird, I got to be honest with you. But I felt safe. And so in the morning, I got up early  not that I make this a great habit  but I went to the gym because I just couldnt sleep and everything else. Well, sure enough, the guard wouldnt let me in. Said I didnt have the correct credentials. Its 5:00 in the morning. I havent had sleep. I was not very happy with this two bit security guard. So you know, I said, I want to see your supervisor. Thirty minutes later, the supervisor wasnt happy with me, they escort me back to my room. It happens. I guess I didnt need to work out anyway.[16][17]
He later apologized, saying ""[i]t was a poor choice of words.""[18]
McHenry was also the subject of discussion regarding a video, posted on his Congressional campaign website, that featured him in the Green Zone in Baghdad, pointing out landmarks and destruction after missile attacks. Veteran's affairs blog VetVoice posted a scathing attack, claiming that McHenry's video violated OPSEC, Operational Security.[19] McHenry later removed the video after discussing the information with the Pentagon, which requested McHenry not place the video back online.[20] Lance Sigmon, McHenry's opponent, later went on to call a press conference to demand an investigation regarding the full nature of the video's effect on Green Zone Troops.[21][broken citation] Sigmon attacked McHenry in a campaign ad regarding this controversy, prompting McHenry to threaten legal action, claiming the ad was false.[22]
On April 16, 2008, Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call revealed that McHenry used funds from his PAC, ""More Conservatives"", to fund the defense of former aide Michael Aaron Lay's voter fraud charges incurred during McHenry's 2004 race.[23] McHenry gave Lay $20,000 to pay legal bills on voter fraud charges brought while Lay worked for him.[24] These expenses were labeled as ""Legal Expense Donation"", according to FEC reports. Lay agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement, which stipulated he complete 100 hours of community service and pay $240.50 in court fees and $250.00 in community service fees to have the charges dismissed.[citation needed] Lay, an employee of the 2004 campaign, lived in McHenry's home in Cherryville which also served as the campaign headquarters during the 2004 election, was indicted for voter fraud in McHenry's election, allegedly voted illegally in two separate instances.[25] McHenry, in response, claimed the case was part of a ""three-year smear campaign"" by District Attorney Locke Bell,[26] despite Locke Bell fund raising for McHenry in previous elections.[27][broken citation]
McHenry has also been called out by the Center for Responsive Politics' Capital Eye, who found evidence that McHenry had been taking money from Countrywide Financial, a company now involved in the subprime mortgage crisis.[28] McHenry took $5,500 from Countrywide's PAC, and served in an investigation into CEO payout fraud, of which one of the target companies was Countrywide Financial itself.
On May 24, 2011, Elizabeth Warrenappointed by President Obama to oversee the development of the new U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)attended a House subcommittee meeting chaired by McHenry, who invited her because he felt she had given misleading testimony during another hearing. Earlier that day, McHenry had appeared on CNBC and accused Warren of lying to Congress about her involvement in government inquiries into mortgage servicing.[29]
The meeting had several late and last minute changes, so Warren altered her schedule to accommodate the chair's request. Around 2:15 pm, McHenry called for a temporary recess to partake in a floor vote. In response, Warren indicated that McHenry's staff had agreed to the 2:15 pm closing time to allow her ample time to attend another meeting. McHenry replied, ""You had no agreement. ... You're making this up, Ms. Warren. This is not the case."" As Warren and some in the audience reacted with surprise, Rep. Elijah Cummings interjected, ""Mr. Chairman ... I'm trying to be cordial here, but you just accused the lady of lying. I think you need to clear this up with your staff.""[30]
Although the CFPB confirmed the agreement, McHenry refused to apologize for his remarks to Warren.[31]
The Hickory Daily Record, the largest paper in McHenry's district, called for McHenry to apologize, saying that it was ""unacceptable for any member of Congress, especially a subcommittee chairman,"" to treat a witness in the manner with which he treated Warren.[32]
In 2004, after one term in the North Carolina General Assembly, McHenry successfully ran for Congress in the 10th Congressional district, which had come open when nine-term incumbent Cass Ballenger retired. McHenry faced a heavily contested primary in the 10th and bested his closest opponent, Catawba County Sheriff David Huffman, in a primary runoff by only 85 votes.
In the general election, McHenry won 64% of the popular vote, defeating Democrat Anne Fischer. However, it was generally thought McHenry's victory in the primary runoff was tantamount to election in November: his district is considered North Carolina's most Republican district, having sent Republicans to represent it since 1963.
In the 2006 election, McHenry defeated Democrat Richard Carsner, gaining almost 62% of the vote on the way to a second term representing the 10th District.
In 2008, McHenry defeated Lance Sigmon in the Republican primary, winning 67% of the vote, and faced Democrat Daniel Johnson in the general election. Johnson was considered the strongest and best-funded Democrat to run in the district in over 20 years. In part because of this, the Cook Political Report moved the race from ""Safe Republican"" to ""Likely Republican."" This meant that in Charlie Cook's opinion, while McHenry still had a considerable advantage, a victory by Johnson could not be ruled out. Shortly after the Cook Political Report's update, Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, also a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, addressed the race and indicated his opinion that an upset is unlikely.[33] McHenry won the 2008 election, 57.56% to 42.44%.[34]
McHenry easily defeated Democratic challenger Jeff Gregory.
McHenry easily defeated Republican primary challengers Ken Fortenberry and Don Peterson in May 2012 with 73% of the vote in the redrawn 10th District."

Meadows was born in Verdun, France and grew up in Brandon, Florida. He graduated from the University of South Florida after briefly studying at Florida State University. During his collegiate years, Meadows joined Sigma Chi Fraternity. In 2011 he moved to Cashiers, North Carolina, where he now lives.
In 1987, Meadows started a small restaurant. He later sold it, and used the proceeds to start a development company in Florida.[citation needed]
In late 2011, Meadows announced he was running for Congress in North Carolina's 11th congressional district, for the seat being vacated by Democratic incumbent Heath Shuler. The district had been significantly altered in redistricting. New lines were drawn straight through the middle of Warren Wilson College. Notably, it lost most of Asheville to the 10th district, while picking up some heavily Republican territory in the foothills. The old 11th had a slight Republican lean, but the new 11th was on paper the most Republican district in the state.[citation needed] In 2011, the North Carolina state legislature re-drew the congressional districts in 2011 based on updated population information from the 2010 census.[1] As a result the district is now 91.2% White, 3.0% Black, 1.4% Native American and 1.0% Asian.[1] District 11 now includes the counties of Buncombe (Asheville), Clay, Cherokee, Graham, Haywood (Waynesville), Henderson (Hendersonville), Jackson (Sylva), Macon (Franklin), McDowell (Marion), Madison, Polk, Swain, Transylvania (Brevard) and Yancey (Burnsville).[2][Notes 1]
He won the Republican primary runoff, in July 2012,[3] and in the general election in November, faced the Democratic candidate, Hayden Rogers, who had been Shuler's chief of staff. During the campaign, on August 28, 2012, Meadows spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.[4] Meadows won the general election with approximately 57 percent of the vote[5] and took office, in January 2013.
Meadows has signed the Contract from America, a list of ten policies assembled by the Tea Party movement.[6][7]
Meadows voted against relief for Hurricane Sandy[8] along with a group of other Republicans who cited pork barrel spending in the relief bill that had nothing to do with hurricane relief.[9]
Meadows introduced the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2014 (H.R. 4411; 113th Congress), a bill that would impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions or money laundering on behalf of Hezbollah or its agents.[10] Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organization in the United States.[10] The bill passed in the House on July 22, 2014.[11] Meadows said that ""we must pass this legislation to make sure that we can do is cripple their ability to finance and put people out of harm's way.""[11]
On July 23, 2014, Meadows introduced the Federal Records Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 5170; 113th Congress), a bill that would change the record keeping requirements about some types of communications to ensure that information is not lost.[12] The bill would make it easier to fire a person who willfully and unlawfully concealed, removed, mutilated, obliterated, falsified, or destroyed any record, book, or other thing in the custody of such employee.[13] It would also ban federal employees from using instant messaging for work purposes.[12]
Meadows is a fiscal conservative and is part of a group that has advocated for a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition he opposed the recent federal stimulus spending and has expressed desire for the federal spending growth rate to be capped at the inflation rate. He supports a moratorium on all earmarks until the budget has been balanced. Meadows opposes any cuts to military spending levels.[14]
Meadows has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and he opposes a raise in all taxes, including the income tax. Meadows supports a flat-rate income tax for all income-earners, and a repeal of the raise in the capital gains tax. He also supports the elimination of the estate tax.[14]
Meadows supports lowering corporate tax rates as a strategy to promote new employment and thus create more jobs. In addition he has called for free trade.[14]
Meadows opposes any restrictions on gun purchases and opposes a national gun registry that would list detailed information about firearm ownership.[14]
Meadows has stated that cap-and-trade emission policies are ineffective and have minimal impact on the global environment. He has proposed that the United States should tap into oil and gas reserves to keep energy prices low, and to develop energy independence. He supports tapping into off-shore oil and gas supplies.[14]
Meadows opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""), and states that it should be replaced by private enterprise.[14]
Meadows is a pro-life supporter and has called abortion a 'tragedy'. He opposes any federal funding for abortion and believes parents should be notified of underage abortion procedures. He also opposes churches and other religious sites providing birth control options.[14]
Meadows opposes same-sex marriage. In March 2013 he stated that if the Supreme Court allowed gay marriage, it would cause a constitutional crisis if the Federal government decided to dismiss state decisions and thus infringe on state's rights.[15]
Meadows has been described as playing an important part of the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.[16][17][18] On August 21, 2013 Meadows wrote an open letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor encouraging them to ""affirmatively de-fund the implementation and enforcement of Obamacare in any relevant appropriations bills brought to the House floor in the 113th Congress, including any continuing appropriations bill.""[19][20] The document was signed by 79 of Meadows' colleagues in the House.[16][20] Heritage Action (which opened operations in North Carolina in January 2011[21]), ran critical Internet advertisements in the districts of 100 Republican lawmakers who failed to sign the letter by Meadows.[22] The letter has been described as being controversial within the Republican Party.[16][23]
The New York Daily News said Meadows put the federal government on the road to shutdown, saying calls to defund ""Obamacare"" through spending bills languished until Meadows wrote his letter.[18] Meadows downplayed his influence, saying ""I'm one of 435 members and a very small part of this.""[18] CNN described Meadows as the ""architect of the brink"" for his letter suggesting that ""Obamacare"" be defunded in any continuing appropriations bill.[16] Meadows said that was sensationalizing his role.[17]
John Ostendorff of the Asheville Citizen-Times wrote Meadows ""said it's best to close the government in the short term to win a delay on 'Obamacare', despite the potential negative impact on the economy.""[17] Ostendorff wrote that Meadows said he was doing what Tea Party members in Western North Carolina wanted him to do.[17] Meadows said his constituents wanted him to fight against ""Obamacare"" ""regardless of consequences.""[16] Jane Bilello, head of the Asheville Tea Party and political action committee said Meadows ""truly represents us"" on the issue of ""Obamacare"".[16] Meadows reportedly holds conference calls with members of the Asheville Tea Party, telling them what's going on in Congress, and about challenges he faces promoting their agenda.[16]
In public comments, Meadows stated he was working on a compromise that involved passing appropriations bills that would fund only parts of the government, such as a bill to fund the National Park Service, Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and a bill to fund the National Institutes of Health. However, partial or ""mini"" funding bills were rejected by the Democratic majority in the United States Senate.[17]"

A Democrat, Adams served as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's 58th House district from her appointment in April 1994 until her election to Congress. A college administrator and Art professor from Greensboro, Adams is known for the many distinctive hats that she wears (she claims to own 900).[3] Adams won the 2014 special election in North Carolina's 12th congressional district to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mel Watt, thus becoming the 100th woman serving in the 113th Congress. She won election to a full two-year term at the same time.[4] [5]


Adams was born on May 27, 1946 in High Point, North Carolina. Her parents were Benjamin Shealey and the former Mattie Stokes. She graduated from West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, in 1964. Adams received her B.S. degree in 1969 and her M.S. degree in 1972, both from North Carolina A&T University and both in Art Education. She continued her studies to receive her Ph.D. in Art Education/Multicultural Education from Ohio State University in 1981.[6][7]
Adams was originally appointed to the North Carolina House District 26 seat in 1994 to replace Herman Gist, who died in office. The district is located in Guilford County and includes most of southeastern Greensboro. She had previously already announced that she was going to challenge Gist for that seat in the Democratic primary that year.[8] After being appointed to the seat, Adams faced conservative businessman and retired engineer O. C. Stafford in the Democratic primary. Stafford was a perennial candidate that had run for various offices, sometimes as a Democrat and other times as a Republican. He previously had challenged Gist as a Republican in the 1992 general election. In 1994, running as a Democrat,[9] he was defeated by Adams in the primary. Adams went on to win a full term in the general election, beating Republican Roger G. Coffer. She faced a rematch with Stafford in the general elections of 1996 and 1998 when Stafford ran as a Republican.[10] Adams won both elections.[11][12] Next, the 2000 election saw Adams again faced with no primary. She went on to defeat Republican real estate broker Jim Rumley in the general election.[13][14]
In 2002, after redistricting, Adams' seat was changed from the 26th district to the 58th district. Her only challenger that year was Libertarian lawyer David Williams who actually withdrew from the race in October because he was moving to Colorado.[15] His name still appeared on the ballot, but Adams won with nearly 86% of the vote.[16]
Adams has been challenged for her seat for many years by Republican legal assistant and party activist Olga Morgan Wright.[17] Wright has run for the seat held by Adams in nearly every election since 2004. Adams defeated Wright and Libertarian challenger Walter Sperko with 66% of the vote in 2004.[18] The next election saw Adams once again faced with no primary and going on to defeat Wright in the general election 66%34%.[19] In 2008, another rematch saw Adams defeat Wright 71.35%28.65%[20]
In 2010, Adams was challenged in the Democratic primary by Ralph C. Johnson. She defeated Johnson with 76.56% of the vote.[21] Adams next faced Republican Darin H. Thomas in the general election, beating him 63.15%36.85%.[22] In 2012, Adams once again did not face any primary opposition and again faced Olga Wright in the general election. This time Adams won with an even wider margin, 79.86%20.14%.[23]
In April 2013, Mel Watt, the only congressman to have served the 12th District since its creation in 1993, was appointed as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Adams was one of the first to announce that if Watt were confirmed, she would run in the ensuing special election. After Watt was confirmed in December, Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the 114th Congress and the special election for the balance of Watt's 11th term.[24]
It was initially thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day). Adams is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte. However, the three Charlotteans in the race split that region's vote. This allowed Adams to win both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold to avoid a runoff. She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November. However, the 12th is a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+26, and Adams was overwhelmingly favored in the general election.
Adams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House. The first was Eva Clayton, who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.
Adams was previously a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986 and a Greensboro City Council member from 1987 until her appointment to the house seat in 1994.[6][8]
In 2008, Adams was elected to a second term as chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.[25]
She was vice-chair of the Government Committee in the state House[26] and previously has been chair of the Appropriations Committee as well as vice-chair of the Commerce, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.[6]
Adams has been a professor of art at Bennett College, in Greensboro as well as the director of the Steel Hall Art Gallery.[6]
In 1990, Adams helped co-found, with Eva Hamlin Miller, the African American Atelier, an organization established to advance awareness and appreciation for visual arts and cultures of African Americans.[27]
She is currently the chairperson of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation which gives out scholarships to students who are attending one of North Carolina's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.[28]
Adams is divorced, the mother of two children.[6][7] She is well noted for the many distinctive hats that she wears.[29]"

They married after graduating and returned to Raleigh where Holding practiced law with Kilpatrick Stockton, one of the oldest law firms in North Carolina.[2]
In 1998, Holding left the practice of law to serve as legislative counsel to U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms in Washington. He was employed by Maupin Taylor, a Raleigh law firm, from 2001-2002. Holding joined the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of North Carolina in 2002, working under Frank Whitney. Under Whitney, the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted a number of high-profile public corruption cases, including former N.C.

In September 2006, Holding was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Whitney's replacement. His priorities included more security in capturing child pornography and drug prosecutions. In addition, Holding prosecuted a state judge, a state Senator, a state Representative, and several sheriffs for political corruption. After Barack Obama won the presidency, Holding was asked to remain in office to complete ongoing public corruption investigations.[3]
When Holding left office the average sentence in drug trafficking cases in eastern North Carolina was almost twice the national average. He indicted eight defendants for conspiring to promote terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad[3] and convicted a number of child pornographers, several of whom were sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.
He worked closely with state prosecutors investigating former Governor Mike Easley, who was convicted for violating state campaign finance law.[4]

Cramer was born in Rolette, North Dakota, the first of the five children of Richard and Clarice Cramer. He was raised in Kindred, North Dakota in Cass County. He graduated from Kindred High School. He received a B.A. degree from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota in 1983. He earned a Master's degree in management from the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota in 2003.[1]
After college, he campaigned for an unsuccessful Republican tax commissioner candidate in 1984. In 1986, he campaigned for U.S. Senator Mark Andrews bid for re-election. Andrews lost to North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party U.S. Senator Kent Conrad. Conrad's party is the North Dakota affiliate of the Democratic Party. Cramer went on to work for the state Republican Party.
He was the Chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party from 1991 to 1993. At age 30, he was the youngest person to be named state party chairman.
In 1993, Republican Governor Ed Schafer appointed him to be State Tourism Director and served that position until he was appointed to become Economic Development Director in 1997.
In 1996, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, a North Dakota native, persuaded Cramer to challenge Democratic U.S. Congressman Earl Pomeroy in North Dakota's At-large congressional district. Pomeroy defeated him 55%-43%.[2] In 1998, Cramer ran against him in a rematch. Pomeroy defeated him again by a wider margin of 56%-41%.[3]
Following his stint as Director of Economic Development, he became Director of the Harold Schafer Leadership Foundation. He served that position until he was appointed to the Public Service Commission by Republican Governor John Hoeven.[4] He was elected to a six-year term in 2004 when he defeated NPL nominee Ron Gumeringer 65%-35%.[5]
Cramer serves as the co-chairman of the Roughrider Honor Flight program. This program gives World War Two veterans the chance to visit the World War Two memorial in Washington, D.C. Cramer has worked to locate veterans and raise money for them to take part in the program.[6]
On January 14, 2010, he announced he would run for the North Dakota seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.[7] Cramer was very visible in early 2010 at North Dakota town hall meetings fighting against health care legislation passed by the US House in late 2009.[8] Cramer has attended numerous Tea Party rallies in North Dakota, where he speaks about energy, taxes, jobs and the Constitution.[9] He was unsuccessful in receiving the nomination at the state Republican Party convention in March 2010, losing to former House Majority Leader Rick Berg.
Cramer won re-election to a second term to the Public Service Commission, defeating Democratic candidate Brad Crabtree 61%-35%.[10]
In 2012, incumbent U.S. Congressman Rick Berg decided to retire to run for the U.S. Senate. Cramer decided to run for the seat a fourth time. In the Republican primary, he defeated fellow Public Service Commissioner Brian Kalk 54%-45%, bypassing the Republican Convention in March.[11][12] Cramer went on to defeat Democratic State Representative Pam Gulleson in the general election 55%-42%. He won 42 of the state's 53 counties.[13] Cramer was sworn in on January 3, 2013.

He supports offshore drilling and opposes regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Cramer supports the coal and oil industry in North Dakota.[17] Cramer signed the ""No Climate Tax Pledge.""[18]
He supports gun rights and opposed the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act that extended tribal jurisdiction over non-tribal members accused of sexual assault and rape against tribal members. Cramer claimed that the provisions would be ruled unconstitutional and that it would be difficult for a non-Tribal member to receive a fair trial from a Tribal Court.[citation needed]
Cramer stirred controversy in September 2013 when he cited a Biblical quotation on the House floor in support of Republicans' efforts to cut some $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, after having used the same quotation in response to a constituent's opposition to the proposal. The bill passed on a largely party-line vote.[19]
In 2010, Cramer and his wife, Kris, became ""interveners"" in the matter of a child whose mother, a former girlfriend of one of their sons, was beaten to death by her current boyfriend. Police investigation as reported by local media indicated that both the child's mother and her boyfriend were involved with drugs. The baby's father lived out of state. Although not related to the child, the Cramers were able to have themselves made temporary guardians of the child. Previously authorities had briefly placed the child with its maternal grandmother, and also are stated in court records as having ""misplaced"" contact information for the baby's father. As a result, the baby's father was not notified of court hearings and did not participate in proceedings resulting in placing the child with the Cramers, and his parental rights were legally terminated. On December 3, 2010, the state supreme court heard arguments with regard to an appeal of the termination by the baby's father.[22]
He is married to Kris, and has five children.[23]"

Chabot, a member of the Republican Party, previously represented the district from 1995 to 2009.


Chabot was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1953 to Gerard Joseph and Doris Leona (ne Tilley) Chabot; paternally, he is of French-Canadian descent.[1] He was raised and remains a Roman Catholic.[citation needed] He graduated from La Salle High School in Cincinnati in 1971, and then from the College of William and Mary in 1975, earning a B.A. in history. He went on to obtain a Juris Doctor degree from Northern Kentucky University's Salmon P. Chase College of Law, in Highland Heights, Kentucky, in 1978. He worked as an elementary school teacher in 19751976 while taking law classes at night.[2]
As a practicing attorney from 1978 to 1994, Chabot handled domestic disputes and the drafting of wills as a sole practitioner.[3] He operated out of small law office in Westwood.[4]
Chabot ran unsuccessfully for the Cincinnati City Council as an independent candidate in 1979 and as a Republican in 1983. Then, running as a Republican, he won a seat in 1985 and was re-elected in 1987 and 1989. In 1988, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against seven-term incumbent Democrat Tom Luken, who defeated Chabot 56-44%.[5] After that, he was appointed a Commissioner of Hamilton County, Ohio, in 1990, and was elected later that year and again in 1992, staying until 1994.
In 1994, he ran for the U.S. House again and defeated Democratic incumbent David S. Mann of Ohio's 1st congressional district, 56%-44%. The race was over balanced budgets and abortion.[6] In 1996, Chabot was a top target from Democrats, but he defeated Democrat Mark Longabaugh, member of the Cincinnati City Council, 54%-43%.[7] In 1998, he defeated popular Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls, 53% to 47%.[8] In the series of debates during that campaign, Qualls criticized Chabot for not funneling enough federal spending back to his home district. Chabot countered that he would not support ""wasteful or unnecessary"" federal programs.[9][10] In 2000, he defeated City Councilman and Harvard graduate John Cranley 53-44%.[11] In 2002, he defeated Greg Harris, with 65% of the vote.[11] In 2004, he defeated Greg Harris again, with 60% of the vote.[12]
He defeated Democratic challenger John Cranley again, this time by a narrower margin of 52-48%.[13]
Chabot was defeated by State Representative Steve Driehaus 52%-48%.[14]
In a rematch, Chabot defeated Democratic incumbent Steve Driehaus,[15][16] Libertarian Jim Berns, and Green Party nominee Richard Stevenson.[17] Chabot won by a margin 51%-46%.[18][19]
Steve Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Jeff Sinnard 58%-38%, with Green nominee Rich Stevenson, and Libertarian nominee Jim Berns picking up the balance.[20] He was helped by the 2010 round of redistricting, which shifted most of heavily Republican Warren County to the 1st.
Chabot has a conservative voting record and is a member of the Republican Study Committee.
Chabot served as one of 12 managers in the Senate Impeachment trial for President Bill Clinton.
As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Chabot authored the legislation to ban the practice of partial-birth abortion. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on November 5, 2003.[21]
Chabot is a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, and has pursued a fiscally conservative standard for the government. The Concord Coalition and anti-tax advocacy groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Taxpayers Union consistently rated Chabot as one of the most anti-tax members of Congress.[22]
Chabot's work in Congress included the elimination of logging subsidies in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,[23] co-sponsored the Voting Rights Act reauthorization,[24] and promoted relations with Taiwan.[25] Chabot opposes abortion except if the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape and incest. Chabot authorized a bill, which passed the House but not the Senate, to make it illegal to take a minor across state lines for an abortion. Chabot has voted to restrict federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.
In 2002, Chabot helped spearhead the local campaign against building a light rail system in Hamilton County.[26] In that same year, Chabot and John Boehner advocated teaching intelligent design alongside the theory of evolution by natural selection in Ohio high schools.[27]
Chabot was a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act,[28] and voted for H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[29] In 2007, Chabot voted against the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Plan (S-CHIP) which would have expanded S-CHIP to cover four million more participants. The bill passed the House and Senate, however President Bush vetoed the bill on October 3, 2007. Chabot voted against the veto-override.
Chabot conducted a Town Hall meeting with his constituents on August 22, 2011, where video cameras were banned. During the meeting two citizens had video cameras seized by a police officer. The incident was captured by one of the seized cameras and by press cameras that were allowed to record the meeting. A Chabot spokesman stated that video cameras will be allowed at the next town hall meeting.[30][31]
On March 25, 2014, Chabot introduced the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act (H.R. 4292; 113th Congress) into the House.[32] According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill ""narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries.""[33] However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were ""taken in violation of international law by Nazi Germany between January 30, 1933 and May 8, 1945.""[33]
The group Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Chabot an ""environmental harm demerit"" in 2006 for contributing to urban sprawl by sponsoring H.R. 4772, a bill that allows land use disputes to proceed immediately to federal court; according to the organization, the bill ""would have undermined local control over local planning and zoning matters, a central principle of America's federal system"".[34] In the same year, the group praised Chabot for offering legislation ""prohibiting the Forest Service from spending taxpayer dollars to build new logging roads for private interests in the Tongass National Forest. The nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters gave Chabot a grade of 10% for the 109th Congress, noting that he voted ""anti-environment"" on 11 out of 12 issues selected by that organization as crucial; his lifetime grade from the LCV is 23%.[35]
In June 2007, Chabot sponsored an amendment to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the Republicans for Environmental Protection. Of the bill, Representative Chabot said ""I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime...But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense"".[36]
Chabot was a longtime critic of pork barrel spending and of federal funding for the arts. ""I wasn't sent up here to bring pork back to my district"" he told the Cincinnati Post in 1995.[citation needed] In previous Congresses, he has cosponsored bills that would have abolished the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. However, the fiscal 2007 Labor HHS Education appropriations bill did include $1.6 million in earmarks for the Cincinnati Museum Center, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Xavier University, the University of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All five organizations have members on their board of directors who are also members of Chabot's inner circle of contributors and fundraisers.[citation needed]
Gary Lindgren, Chabot's chief of staff, said that ""there's not a connection"" between the donations and the earmarks. Lindgren said the earmarks are for major institutions where it would be expected that board members would be politically active. ""You could look at almost any district, and the people who sit on boards of museums and institutions will be wealthy and donate to campaigns"", said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. Schatz noted that Chabot has won high marks from CAGW in the past.[37]
On August 22, 2011, Representative Chabot asked Cincinnati police to confiscate cameras being used by private citizens to record a town-hall meeting, even as media television cameras recorded the incident.[40] YouTube videos of the incident provided wide awareness of the incident, and the participating police officer was later disciplined.[41]
Chabot and his wife Donna have two children."

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is located in the north-central portion of the state and includes Lima, Tiffin, and Elyria.


Jordan was born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio and attended Graham High School, graduating in 1982. While at Graham, he was a four-time state wrestling champion with a career record of 150-1. He graduated from the University of WisconsinMadison in 1986, obtaining his bachelor's degree in economics. Jordan was a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion. In the 1985 NCAA championship match, Jordan defeated future two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time world champion John Smith.[1] He later earned a master's degree in education from the Ohio State University in Columbus, and in 2001 obtained his law degree from Capital University, also in Columbus. Before entering politics, he was an assistant wrestling coach with the Ohio State University wrestling program.
Jordan was first elected to the Ohio General Assembly in November 1994 and went on to serve three terms as State Representative of the 85th Ohio House District. In 1996, he offered an amendment to the Welfare Reform Bill that limited the amount of time that an able-bodied individual could remain on welfare. He also created the Income Tax Reduction Fund, which required that any state revenue surpluses be used to lower the income tax burden on Ohioans rather than be used for further government spending.[citation needed]
In 2000, he won a seat in the Ohio Senate by defeating independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger by a margin of 88 percent to 12 percent. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, this time by a smaller margin of 79 percent to 21 percent. In May 2006, Jordan won the Republican primary race for the 4th Congressional district of Ohio. He also won a 100% lifetime rating from the Ohio Taxpayers Association, which endorsed Jordan in his bid for Congress.[2]
Jordan was named Watchdog of the Treasury (1996, 2000, 2004), Outstanding Legislator (2004), Outstanding Freshman Legislator (1996), Friend of the Taxpayer (1997), and Pro-Life Legislator of the Year (1998) by the United Conservatives of Ohio, the Defender of Life award from the Ohio Right to Life Society, and the 2001 Leadership in Government Award from the Ohio Roundtable and Freedom Forum.[citation needed] Additionally, Senate President Bill Harris appointed Jordan to be the chairman of the Senate Judiciary on Criminal Justice Committee.
Jordan won the Republican primary for the 4th District in 2006 after 26-year incumbent Mike Oxley announced his retirement. Despite the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio that year, Jordan skated to victory in the general election, defeating Democrat Rick Siferd in the general election, 60% to 40%. The 4th has long been considered as one of the most (if not the most) Republican districts in Ohio and the nation; the district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but 16 years since the Civil War.
He was reelected in 2008, defeating Democrat Mike Carroll 65% to 35%.[3]
Jordan chaired the Republican Study Committee during the 112th Congress. He was elected over Representative Louie Gohmert, who was backed by several tea party groups.[4] Jordan reportedly turned down a position on the Appropriations Committee.[5]
During the 114th Congress, Jordan helped found the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives working to ""support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans."" [6] He currently serves as the group's first chairman. [7]
Jordan received a vote for Speaker on the first day of the 113th Congress from fellow conservative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas. Jordan received two votes for Speaker during the 114th Congress. [8]
Jordan serves as chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits, and Administrative Rules.[9]
On May 2, 2014, Jordan introduced the simple resolution Calling on Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., to appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative nonprofit groups by the Internal Revenue Service (H.Res. 565; 113th Congress) into the House, where it passed on May 7, 2014.[10] The resolution asks Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the 2013 IRS scandal. Jordan said that ""we need this special counsel to help us get to the truth because the so-called investigation by the Justice Department has been a joke. The current investigation has no credibility because it is being headed by a maxed-out donor who is financially invested in the president's success.""[11]
While serving in the Ohio Senate, he supported the Tax and Expenditure Limitation Amendment, a state constitutional amendment that would require a vote of the people in order to raise taxes or increase spending over certain limits.[12]
In Congress, Jordan is among the most conservative Republicans, earning a perfect score from the American Conservative Union.[13] He has voted consistently for anti-abortion legislation and was endorsed by Ohio Right to Life in 2012.[14] During the 112th Congress, he was one of 40 ""staunch"" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills.[15]
Jordan has been a leading critic of President Barack Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) program, advocating for its shutdown.[16]
Jordan has supported the continued production and upgrades of M1 Abrams tanks in his district. The Pentagon opposed the bipartisan action to maintain funding.[17] The Pentagon wants to put a hold on tank upgrades at a Lima plant until a new version is ready, possibly in 2017, in order to save $3 billion. The plant supports approximately 800 jobs in the district.[18][19]
Jordan has been a critic of Speaker John Boehner's plan to raise the debt ceiling. In 2010, he was chair of the Republican Study Committee, and during the U.S. government shutdown of 2013, he was still considered its most powerful member.[20] That group was the primary proponent and executor of the Republican Congressional strategy to force a government shutdown, in order to force changes in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.[20]
Jordan won against Democratic nominee Mike Carroll.
Jordan defeated Democrat Doug Litt and Libertarian Donald Kissick in the general election.
Jordan defeated Democrat Jim Slone and Libertarian Chris Kalla in the general election.
Jordan defeated Democrat Janet Garrett in the general election.

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes most of Toledo's suburbs including Bowling Green and Perrysburg. It also includes Findlay. He is also the head of the controversial H.R. 4752 bill, which threatens the neutrality and future of the internet.[2]


Born in Bluffton, Ohio, Latta earned his B.A. at Bowling Green State University in 1978 and his J.D. at the University of Toledo College of Law in 1981. His father, Del Latta, represented the 5th from 1959 to 1989 and served as ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee from 1975 to his retirement.
Latta worked as a private practice attorney before entering politics.
Latta served as a Wood County Commissioner from 1991 to 1997. He then represented the 2nd senate district in the Ohio Senate from 1997 to 2001 and the 6th house district in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007.
Latta introduced the Sportsmens Heritage And Recreational Enhancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 3590; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives on November 21, 2013.[3] The bill is an omnibus bill that covers several firearms, fishing, hunting, and federal land laws.[4] The bill passed the House on February 5, 2014.
On July 22, 2014, Latta introduced the E-LABEL Act (H.R. 5161; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow manufacturers of electronic devices with a screen to display information required by the agency digitally on the screen rather than on a label affixed to the device.[5][6] Latta argued that e-labeling would ""give greater flexibility to design consumer products"" and that ""by some estimates e-labeling will save manufactures over $80 million a year.""[6]
When Del Latta decided to retire from Congress in 1988, Bob Latta ran in the Republican primary. However, he lost by twenty-seven votes to then Ohio State Senate president Paul Gillmor, who went on to win the general election.
After Gillmor's sudden death in September 2007, Latta decided to run again for the open seat. He defeated state senator Steve Buehrer, among other candidates, in the November primary. He benefited not only from his name recognition, but because Wood County, home to Bowling Green, is the largest whole county in the sprawling district.
In the special general election, Latta defeated Democratic candidate Robin Weirauch on December 11, 2007 by a margin of 57% to 43%. He was sworn in on December 13, 2007.[7]
Latta faced Democratic nominee Caleb Finkenbiner and Libertarian nominee Brian L. Smith in the general election, he won the election.
Latta was re-elected in 2012. He beat Democratic nominee, Angela Zimmann and Libertarian nominee, Eric Eberly.[8][9] He was endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, the NRA and National Right to Life.[10]

Ohio House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","John Andrew Boehner (/benr/;[a] born November 17, 1949) is the 61st and current Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.[2] A member of the Republican Party, he is the U.S. Representative from Ohio's 8th congressional district, serving since 1991. The district includes several rural and suburban areas near Cincinnati and Dayton.
Boehner previously served as the House Minority Leader from 2007 until 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. As Speaker of the House, Boehner is second in line to the presidency of the United States following the Vice President in accordance with the Presidential Succession Act.


Boehner was born in Reading, Ohio, the son of Mary Anne (ne Hall) and Earl Henry Boehner, the second of twelve children. His father was of German descent and his mother had German and Irish ancestry.[3][4][5][6][7] He grew up in modest circumstances, having shared one bathroom with his eleven siblings in a two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. His parents slept on a pull-out couch.[8] He started working at his family's bar at age 8, a business founded by their grandfather Andy Boehner in 1938.[8] He has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life. All but two of his siblings still live within a few miles of each other; two are unemployed and most of the others have blue-collar jobs.[9][10]
Boehner attended Cincinnati's Moeller High School and was a linebacker on the school's football team, where he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Graduating from Moeller in 1968, when U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back.[18] He earned his B.A. in business administration from Xavier University in 1977, becoming the first person in his family to attend college, taking seven years as he held several jobs to pay for his education.[8]
Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and plastics industry. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.[5]
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of Union Township, Butler County, Ohio. He then served as an Ohio state representative from 1985 to 1990.[19]
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman Buz Lukens, who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. He trounced Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote. This was tantamount to election in the heavily Republican 8th District. He has been reelected 10 times with no substantial opposition, and even ran unopposed in 1994 and 2012.
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal.[20]
Boehner, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as House Republican Conference Chairman which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the Freedom to Farm Act that, among other provisions, revises and simplifies direct payment programs for crops and eliminates milk price supports through direct government purchases.
In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted ""coup"" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.[21]
On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democratsalong with dissenting Republicanswould vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.[22]
In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.[23]
Following the election of President George W. Bush, Boehner was elected as chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the Pension Protection Act and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.[24]
Boehner and Senator Ted Kennedy authored the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which was signed by President George W. Bush in 2002.[25] Boehner said that it was his proudest achievement in two decades of public service.[26] Boehner was friends with Kennedy, also a Roman Catholic, and every year they chaired fundraisers for cash-strapped Catholic schools.[27]
In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006. The election followed Tom DeLay's resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called ""earmark"" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri and Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as Majority Whip, the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,[28] due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuo of Puerto Rico to vote).[29]
After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader. While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.
According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander M. Levin, Dean of the House John Dingell, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.[30] As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ex officio member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about ""economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream"".[27] November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,[31][32] all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011. He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on Wednesday, January 5, 2011.[33] He is the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883). He is also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.[citation needed]
As Speaker, he is still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition, he normally does not take part in debate, although he has the right to do so, and almost never votes from the floor.[34] He is not a member of any House committees.
Boehner was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House on January 3, 2013 at the beginning of the 113th United States Congress.[35] He received 220 votes, needing 214 to win.[36]
Boehner appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, ""I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass. I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes. And I'm not giving that up to be President of the United States.""[37]
In July 2014, Boehner moved forward on a lawsuit to force the President to impose penalties on companies who failed to provide health care coverage for their employees.[38] Boehner had pressed for legislation to delay this mandate the previous year.[39] The day after voting to sue the President for what he saw as ignoring a law passed by Congress, Boehner called on the President to ignore another law passed by Congress.[40] The third law firm selected finally filed the suit in November 2014, after Boehner criticized Obama's unilateral moves on immigration policy.[41]
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.[42] In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said ""They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice thats gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again.""[43] Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor.[44]
A September 2010 New York Times story said Boehner was ""Tightly Bound to Lobbyists"" and ""He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nations biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS."".[45]
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after he learned that it featured a video by David Wojnarowicz, A Fire in My Belly, that contained an image of a crucifix with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, ""Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in].""[46]
On January 1, 2013, after passing the fiscal cliff deal, Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie harshly criticized Boehner.[47] Boehner later promised to pass the bill.[48] However, some commentators praised Boehner for not passing a bill they saw as full of pork barrel.[49]
Many Republicans were ready for a new House of Representatives Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections. EMC Research reported 60% of participants in their telephone survey wanted a new chairman.[50] Conservatives including Sarah Palin also criticized Boehner for not stopping the Cromnibus spending package in 2014 after being re-elected, stating ""It stinks to high heaven."".[51] WND then launched a campaign to elect a new chairman which gained the support of 500,000 individual letters being sent to congress in protest of Boehner.[52] In the end there were a total of 25 votes against Boehner, 29 were needed in order to choose a new speaker.[53] Boehner responded by removing those who opposed him from influential committees.[54]
A profile in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said, ""On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen.""[55] The Plain Dealer says Boehner ""has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable.""[56]
Boehner has been classified as a ""hard-core conservative"" by OnTheIssues.[57] Although Boehner has a conservative voting record, when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to the Washington Post: ""From illegal immigration to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives  examining his voting record  see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs.""[58]
Boehner voted for a Federal Marriage Amendment. In a letter to the Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, ""I oppose any legislation that would provide special rights for homosexuals... Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of the traditional family as one of the fundamental tenets of western civilization.""[59][60]
On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his ""Democrat friends"" such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters ""have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq.""
Boehner is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[61]
""Im not qualified to debate the science over climate change, Boehner said at a press conference on May 29, 2014 at which he criticized proposed federal regulations on coal-fired power plants.[62][63][64]
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.[65]
On October 3, 2008 Boehner voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),[66] believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to ""purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector.""
Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama, including the ""cap and trade"" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying ""one dime"" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.[67] He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan[68] and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI).[69] He has advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs. Boehner favors making changes in Social Security, such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation, and limiting payments to those who need them.[67]
In 2011 Boehner called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act one of our highest legislative priorities.[70][71]
In 2013 Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to hold Defense spending hostage in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.[72]
In the November 2006 election, Boehner defeated the Democratic Party candidate, U.S. Air Force veteran Mort Meier, 64% to 36%.[73]
In the November 2008 election, Boehner defeated Nicholas Von Stein, 68% to 32%.[74]
Boehner was opposed by Democratic nominee Justin Coussoule, Constitution Party nominee Jim Condit, and Libertarian nominee David Harlow; but won the 2010 election.[75]
As Republican House Leader, Boehner is a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions. In July 2010, President Barack Obama began singling out Boehner for criticism during his speeches.[76] In one speech, Obama mentioned Boehner's name nine times[77] and accused him of believing that police, firefighters, and teachers were jobs ""not worth saving.""[78]
The top 10 contributors (not including political parties or other candidates) to John Boehner's campaign for the period of Jan 1, 2011 - Dec 31, 2012 represent a variety of interests.[85]
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the Wetherington section of West Chester Township. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.[86] Lindsay is married to Dominic Lakhan, a Jamaican-born construction worker.[87]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, anchored by the city of Toledo, includes all of Ottawa and Erie counties, and part of Lucas and Lorain counties.
Serving her sixteenth term in the House of Representatives, Kaptur is the dean of Ohio's congressional delegation, the longest serving woman in the House and the second longest-serving ever after Edith Rogers; in the Congress, she is tied for the second longest-serving woman with Senator Barbara Boxer, behind Senator Barbara Mikulski. She ranks 15th out of 435 members in seniority and serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.


Kaptur, a Polish-American,[1] was born in Toledo, Ohio, the daughter of Anastasia Delores (ne Rogowski) and Stephen Jacob Kaptur.[2] Her family operated a small grocery. Kaptur became a Democratic Party volunteer in the late 1950s, at age 13.
Kaptur graduated from St. Ursula Academy in 1964 and became the first member in her family to attend college. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of WisconsinMadison in 1968 and a Master of Urban Planning from the University of Michigan in 1974.[3] She did post-graduate study in urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981.
Kaptur served on the Toledo-Lucas County Plan Commissions from 1969 to 1975 and was director of planning for the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs (19751977) founded by the late Msgr. Geno Baroni. She later served as a domestic policy advisor during President Jimmy Carter's Administration.
While pursuing a doctorate in urban planning development finance at MIT, Kaptur was recruited to run for Congress in 1982 against freshman Republican Ed Weber, who had upset 26-year incumbent Lud Ashley two years earlier. Despite being outspent by almost 3-1, she defeated Weber 58%-39%.[4][5] Although the 9th had traditionally been a Democratic bastion, Kaptur's win was considered a major upset.[citation needed]
In 1984, Kaptur faced a strong challenge from Republican Frank Venner, longtime anchorman and weatherman at WTVG, but defeated him 55%-44%,[6] even as Ronald Reagan carried the district. Between 1984 and 2004, she won every election with at least 74% of the vote. In 2004, she faced her first serious opponent in 20 years in Lucas County auditor Larry Kaczala. However, Kaptur dispatched him fairly easily, winning by 68%-32%.
Kaptur won her 13th term with 74% of the vote.[7]
Kaptur won her 14th term with 74% of the vote.[8]
Shortly after achieving fame during the 2008 election, conservative figure Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher announced that he was considering challenging Kaptur in the 2010 election.[9][10][11] However, he chose not to run. Kaptur was instead challenged by Republican Rich Iott, a Tea Party movement favorite. Kaptur won re-election to her 15th term with 59% of the vote,[12] which was her worst re-election performance since 1984.[clarification needed]
Redistricting after the 2010 census extended the 9th District all the way to western Cleveland. The new map put the home of incumbent 10th District congressman Dennis Kucinich into the 9th as well, so they ran against one other in the Democratic primary. Graham Veysey, a small business owner from Cleveland, also ran in the primary. Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote, while Kucinich received 40%.[13][14] In the general election, she won a 16th term against Republican Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher and Libertarian Sean Stipe.[15]
Kaptur's 2014 opponent was longtime Republican activist and leader from the West Side of Cleveland Richard May, who beat Lakewood resident Robert C. Horrocks, Jr. in the May 6 primary.[16] Kaptur won 68%-32%.
Kaptur is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She was once named ""Most Valuable Member"" of the House by The Nation. In 1996, Kaptur was asked by Ross Perot to be his vice-presidential running mate. She eventually declined.[17]
Kaptur was a dedicated opponent of the America Invents Act that passed into law and changed the U.S. Patent System. Kaptur opposed changing from a ""first to invent system"" to a ""first to file system,"" claiming it hurt small businesses.[18] Kaptur stated ""Our patent system is the finest in the world... the proposed solutions are special fixes that benefit these few giants at the expense of everyone else.""[19]
Responding to Roger Durbin, a World War II veteran and constituent, Kaptur first suggested the creation of a National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.[citation needed]
On December 10, 1987, Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives. The legislation authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission to establish a World War II memorial, however, as the bill was not voted on before the end of the session it failed to be enacted into law. Kaptur introduced similar legislation in 1989 and 1991 but these bills also failed to become law.
Kaptur introduced legislation for the fourth time on January 27, 1993. This time the legislation was voted on and passed in the House on May 10, 1993. After a companion bill was passed in the United States Senate, President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on May 25, 1993. Durbin died before the memorial was built, but Kaptur spoke at the memorial dedication ceremony, along with Durbin's granddaughter, on May 29, 2004.
Kaptur later said that she felt ""a great sense of fulfillment"" that the memorial was finally built. ""This generation was the most unselfish America has ever seen,"" she said. ""They never asked anybody for anything in return.""[20]
On April 12, 2011 Marcy Kaptur introduced H.R. 1489 to restore the Glass-Steagall Act. It states ""To repeal certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and revive the separation between commercial banking and the securities business, in the manner provided in the Banking Act of 1933, the so-called ""Glass-Steagall Act"", and for other purposes."" There were 30 co-sponsors. [21]
Though generally reckoned as a liberal-to-progressive Democrat, Kaptur holds moderately conservative views on abortion. She has voted in favor of some proposals to restrict access to abortion but has opposed others. In January 2007, she was the only member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to vote against funding for stem-cell research.[22] Kaptur has expressed support for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, and voted in favor of it on November 9.[23] Kaptur was one of only sixteen Democrats to vote in favor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act on May 4, 2011.[24] Kaptur also voted in favor of banning partial-birth abortions in 2000 and 2003.[25][26] Kaptur voted against the Child Custody Protection Act in 1999 and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2005.[27][28] Kaptur voted against allowing privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals twice in 1995, as well as 1997, 1998 and 1999.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2005, Kaptur voted in favor of lifting the ban on abortions at overseas military hospitals.[34]
Kaptur is a staunch opponent of free trade agreements. She helped lead opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations for the People's Republic of China, and fast track authority for the president.
Marcy Kaptur expressed strong opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided a bailout for U.S. banks.[35] Addressing Wall Street banks, she said, ""You have perpetrated the greatest financial crimes ever on this American Republic.""
She also stated, ""America doesn't need to bail you out. It needs to secure real assets and property. Federal regional reserve banks should have a new job to help renegotiate . American people should get equity in any companies. Major job creation to rebuild our infrastructure. Regulate, we need a modern GlassSteagall Act. Refinancing must return a major share of profits to a new Social Security and Medicare lock box.""
Kaptur's opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was highlighted in Michael Moore's 2009 documentary Capitalism: A Love Story[36]
Marcy Kaptur backed The American Clean Energy and Security Act in the U.S. House after she was able to insert an amendment that would authorize the Secretary of Energy to create power marketing authorities in regions where none exist. One such area would be the Great Lakes region. Kaptur said the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation could serve as the vehicle for administering up to $3.5 billion in borrowing authority to stimulate economic development through creation of green energy such as solar power and wind power. Kaptur said the $3.5 billion in borrowing authority would promote ""regional equity"" and serve as a powerful engine for job creation in a region that has suffered from high energy costs, especially expensive electricity.
She has consistently supported military spending bills."

""Mike"" Turner (born January 11, 1960) is the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 10th congressional district, serving in Congress since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party.
The district, numbered as the 3rd District from 2003 to 2013, is based in Dayton and consists of Montgomery, Greene and Fayette counties.


Turner, a non-denominational Protestant Christian, was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1960 to Vivian and Ray Turner. His mother was a teacher in the Wayne School system in Huber Heights and his father worked as a member of IUE Local 801 for 42 years after serving in the military. Turner was raised in East Dayton and has one sister.[1]
Turner graduated from Belmont High School in 1978 and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the Ohio Northern University in 1982, a Juris Doctor from Case Western Reserve University in 1985, and an MBA from the University of Dayton in 1992. He practiced law with local firms and businesses in the Dayton area before entering politics. He also practiced law during the brief time between his service as Mayor of Dayton and as a Member of Congress.
Turner was elected Mayor of Dayton, Ohio in 1993, narrowly defeating incumbent Mayor Richard Clay Dixon. Prior to Mayor-Elect Turner taking office, the city suffered a number of economic setbacks. Upon taking office, Turner focused on attracting business to the city and on redeveloping vacant and underutilized real estate packages known as brownfields.
During Turners time as mayor of Dayton, the city reached an agreement to construct a baseball stadium for a class A minor league team affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds, known as the Dayton Dragons. Since its construction, Fifth Third Field stadium has been a linchpin of economic development in Downtown Dayton and has provided millions of dollars in revenue for the area.[2]
Turner was the mayor of Dayton during the planning and construction of the Schuster Center, which he supported for its contribution to reviving downtown. He facilitated discussions with key leaders from the projects conception to its completion.[3] The Schuster Center is a performing arts center located at the corner of Second and Main Streets in downtown Dayton. The Center has served as a forum for the Victoria Theatres Broadway Series, the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, the Dayton Ballet, and also as a speaking location for visiting political leaders, such as former New York Governor Mario Cuomo.
Turner also started a program called Rehabarama,[4] which attracted professionals to historic properties inside the city. Mayor Turner welcomed diplomats and leaders from all over the world to the region as part of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords.
He was reelected in 1997 over Democratic City Commissioner Tony Capizzi. He continued efforts to develop the economy of both the city and the surrounding region. Turner was narrowly defeated in 2001 by then-State Senator Rhine McLin.
Turner is currently a member of the Armed Services and Government Reform committees. In 2009, he was named Ranking Member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Armed Services.
In November 2002, Turner was elected to Congress, succeeding Democrat Tony Patrick Hall, who had been appointed by President Bush to the UN. After taking office, in January 2003 Turner was appointed to the Armed Services Committee, a position he has used to advocate for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base located in his district, and to the Government Reform Committee.
Due to his urban background, focus on the economic redevelopment of cities, and service as Daytons mayor, Turner is sometimes described as an urban Republican. Recognizing Turner's work on urban development, then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert appointed Turner as Chairman of the Saving Americas Cities working group. The group was formed to work with the Administration to ""foster economic development and redevelopment and streamline government services in America's cities to help them prosper and grow."" [5]
During the 109th Congress, Turner served on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, in addition to his work on his two other committees, the House Armed Services and Government Reform Committees.
Serving on the Armed Services Committee, Turner had advocated for an expansion to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, providing testimony to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). This effort proved successful in 2008, when the Air Force announced that 1,000 jobs and over $230 million in federal funding would move to Wright-Patterson AFB. Turner has said that this is the largest single investment in Wright-Patterson since World War II.[6]
In 2006, the Dayton Development Coalition (DDC), a non-profit and non-partisan group which advocates for economic development in the Miami Valley,[7] began a regional branding campaign. Turner's company Turner Effect bid on, and was awarded, the contract to conduct the marketing research associated with the campaign. Dayton Daily News publisher Doug Franklin and Democratic Montgomery County Commissioner Dan Foley both stated their support for the Coalition's contract award.[8][9] In April 2008, Turner Effect withdrew from the branding implementation contract.[10]
Citizens for Turner contracted with Turner Effect for professional services, such as the production of literature, a common and legal process according to the House Committee on Official Standards and Conduct.[11] But, watchdog groups and media reports raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest in these two cases. The DDC said that its members were ""unanimous"" in their decision that there was ""no conflict [of interest]"" in their having chosen Turner's company.[8][12]
On July 7, 2008, Turner wrote an op-ed in the Hillsboro Times-Gazette in support of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, referred to as the GI Bill.[13] In May of that year, Turner opposed an earlier version of the GI Bill. Turner has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC; he helped save a nursing home at the Dayton VA Medical Center.
In October 2008, Turner joined then Senator Hillary Clinton, First Lady Laura Bush, Senator Pete Domenici and Rep. Brad Miller to announce the introduction of bipartisan legislation that would permanently authorize two historic preservation grant programs.[14] The House bill, H.R. 3981, would permanently authorize the programs known as ""Save Americas Treasures,"" established by the Clinton Administration, and ""Preserve America,"" established by the Bush Administration. The bill was introduced in the House by Turner and Miller as co-chairs of the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus and in the Senate by Clinton and Domenici.[15] The two grant programs are complementary. Preserve America supports ""community efforts to demonstrate sustainable uses of their historic and cultural sites, focusing on economic and educational opportunities related to heritage tourism."" The Save America's Treasures grant program, ""funds ""bricks-and-mortar"" projects, by helping local communities develop sustainable resource management strategies and sound business practices for the continued preservation and use of heritage assets."" [16]
In June 2009, Turner introduced H.J. Res 57, the Preserving Capitalism in America amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment, which has 104 cosponsors in the House, would prohibit the United States government from owning any stock in corporations.[17]
In February 2010, Turner released a report on ""The Impact of the Housing Crisis on Local Communities and the Federal Response"" in conjunction with the Northeast-Midwest Institute and the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition.[18] The report included testimony and proposals from local Dayton community leaders such as Commissioner Dean Lovelace and Miami Valley Fair Housing Center CEO Jim McCarthy, who participated in an August 2009 housing and foreclosure crisis forum in Dayton.[19] Turner has indicated he will offer legislation based on the recommendations of the report.
Turner voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. He opposed the ""$1 trillion government takeover of our nations health care system"" because it will ""increase budget deficits and decrease the quality of our health care services,"" Turner said.[20]
In his emerging role as a senior Republican in the House of Representatives on issues related to missile defense, nuclear weapons and military space assets, Turner has been highly critical of the Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach[21] and Nuclear Posture Review regarding the protection and defense of the U.S. and our allies. In an April 12 USA Today editorial, Turner stated, ""Our nuclear deterrent serves an important role in protecting the United States from would-be aggressors. Telling our adversaries that we are unwilling to use the full extent of our assets to protect our nation is either disingenuous or dangerous."" [22] In fact, in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act, Turner successfully included language that stated the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review weakens the national security of the United States. The language was adopted by the Committee on Armed Services with bipartisan support and also received bipartisan support when passing the full House of Representatives.[23]
In 2012, Turner called for a missile defense site on the east coast of the United States, to defend against missiles that would be launched from Iran. The east coast site would be the third such site, joining two others on the west coast that are designed to defend against an attack from North Korea.[24]
Romanian Congressional Caucus
Turner was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2002.
Turner received 58% of the vote following the retirement of 23-year incumbent Democrat Tony P. Hall from Congress after Hall was named U. N. Special Envoy for Hunger Issues by President George W. Bush. Earlier that year, Turner won the Republican nomination when he decisively defeated Roy Brown with 80% of the vote in a heavily contested primary.[25] Brown was the son and grandson of a former area Republican Congressmen Bud Brown and Clarence J. Brown and operated a local newspaper company named Brown Publishing. The Federal Elections Commission ruled that Browns newspapers inappropriately slanted their coverage of the primary contest to favor Roy Brown.[26] Despite this, Turner still won the contest decisively. In the general election, Turner defeated Congressman Tony Halls chief of staff, Rick Carne, after Carne won the nomination to succeed his former boss. Turner got a substantial assist from the 2000s round of redistricting. The old 7th had been a fairly compact district centered around Dayton. However, redistricting added some Republican-leaning suburbs to the east.
In 2004, Turner defeated former businesswoman Jane Mitakides with over 62% of the vote. The district was considered a key area in the swing state of Ohio in that years presidential race. Turner ran on his record of advocacy for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and on the importance of his seat on the Armed Services Committee.
In 2006, the Democrats planned to target Turner for defeat. Three Democrats entered the Third District Primary to run against Turner in the general election. Veterinarian Stephanie Studebaker defeated local bankruptcy attorney David Fierst and recalled Waynesville Mayor Charles W. Sanders. Studebaker had previously affiliated with former Vermont Governor Howard Deans Presidential campaign in Ohio during the 2004 race. After winning the nomination, Studebaker and her husband Sam were both arrested for domestic violence.[27] Studebaker subsequently dropped out of the race citing her family concerns and impending legal issues. Following Studebakers withdrawal, four Democrats entered a special election primary to face Turner, eventually settling on former Assistant United States Attorney Richard Chema. Turner defeated Chema with 58% of the vote.
Jane Mitakides beat Sanders in a primary in 2008 and faced Turner in a rematch from 2004. Turner again focused largely on economic issues of job creation and protection for workers impacted by the national and regional recession. In a difficult political climate for Republicans, Turner defeated Mitakides with 64% of the vote, his largest margin of victory in any election.
Turner was challenged by Democratic nominee Joe Roberts in the general election and won with 68 percent of the vote.
After redistricting, Turner's district was renumbered as the 10th district. It absorbed much of the neighboring 7th district, represented by fellow Republican Steve Austria. The district was made significantly more compact than its predecessor, absorbing all of Dayton.
It initially looked like Turner would face Austria in a primary.[28] However, Austria dropped out of the race, handing the nomination to Turner.[29] Turner then went on to defeat Democratic attorney Sharon Neuhardt with 60 percent of the vote.
*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2002, Ronald Williamitis received 14 votes.
On march 3, 2015 Montenegrin, Bosnian and other major Balkan based news agencies reported that Turner invoved himselft into Sutorina dispute between Bosnia and Montenegro. According to news agencies Turner sent a letter of warring to Bosniak member of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegovic where Turner suggested Bosnia to give up territorial dispute over Sutorina or otherwise United States could suspend aid to Bosnia.[31][32] As a result of this Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina will consider threats by congressman Turner. [33]
Turner has been married to his wife Lori, Vice President of Network Marketing at Kettering Health Network, since 1987 and is the father of two daughters, Jessica and Carolyn.

Fudge has also worked as an auditor for the estate tax department and has occasionally served as a visiting judge and as a chief referee for arbitration. [9]
Fudge was the Mayor of Warrensville Heights, a middle-class and mostly African-American suburb of Cleveland, from January 2000 until November 18, 2008.[1][10] She was victorious in her first ever run for elective office, becoming the first woman and first African-American elected mayor of the town.[11]

After Jones' unexpected death on August 20, 2008, Fudge was selected as Jones' replacement on the November ballot by a committee of local Democratic leaders. This virtually assured her of election in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district.[13][14] Fudge won the November 4 general election, defeating Republican Thomas Pekarek with 85 percent of the vote.[15] She was unopposed in a November 18 special election for the balance of Jones' fifth term, and won with less than 9,000 votes cast.[16] [17] She was sworn in on November 19, 2008.[18][19]

Fudge said, ""If we don't vote, believe it or not they are going to file articles of impeachment against our President. If we don't vote, the street in front of your house is not going to get fixed. If we don't vote, we're going to have hungry children across this country"".[21]
She also predicted GOP members of Congress would ""try to make our president an illegitimate president"" with claims that he isn't born in the United States, wasn't smart enough to go to Harvard, and ignores the laws. [22]
""We will have two more years of that foolishness if they take back the Senate and get a few more seats in the House,"" said Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat, who predicted voters ""will be standing in the line waiting for the doors to open"" at the polls when they hear what members of her group have to say. [23]
Rep. Fudge, during the Congressional Black Caucus town hall meeting chastised voters for complaining and reminded them the Congressional Black Caucus was doing fighting for them. Rep. Fudge commented; ""The black caucus fights for you every day. Even when you wont fight for yourself. We fight for you. Whether its immigration or education, whether its food stamps or housing, we fight for you every day. So my message to you is to contain your complaining."" [24]

He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Ohio House of Representatives.
The district includes many Columbus suburbs north and east of the City.


The son of Italian immigrants, Tiberi was born in Columbus and attended the city's Woodward Park Middle school, then Northland High School. Tiberi attended The Ohio State University where he was a member of The Ohio State University Marching Band. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1985 with a degree in journalism and was the first in his family to graduate from college.[1] He was later awarded an honorary doctorate in the Humanities by Capital University in May, 2005.
Upon graduation from college, Tiberi worked as a realtor for RE/MAX Achievers, a franchise of RE/MAX, located in Lewis Center, Ohio. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1993, and he soon rose to the position of House Majority Leader.
Tiberi has authored legislation that made it easier for returning military veterans to receive federal jobs and provided for more federal assistance to caregivers of incapacitated adults. Both of the bills were passed in 2006.
Tiberi voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, saying the bill was ""loaded with Nancy Pelosi's grab bag of big spending wishes."" Following passage of the bill, Tiberi wrote a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in an effort to bring stimulus money to his district.[2][3]
Tiberi has been described as loyal to Speaker John Boehner.[4]
Then-chairman of the Select Education Subcommittee, Pat Tiberi wrote the bill that reauthorized the Older Americans Act through fiscal year 2011. This bill provides most of the funding for social services and nutritional programs for the nations seniors.[5] Pat Tiberi received an 86 from the Retire Safe-Positions and a 10 from Alliance for Retired Americans-Lifetime Score.[6] Congressman Tiberi has introduced other legislation to improve care for older Americans including writing and sponsoring The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006. Pat Tiberi supports a full repeal of Obamacare under the statement that government has no place in getting between a patients relationship with their doctor.[7]
Pat Tiberi supports reform to the No Child Left Behind bill. He has introduced legislation to improve local flexibility by allowing some school districts to go to the Secretary of Education and present their own plan for the allocation of Title 1 federal funding for approval. This amendment was signed into law in 2002.[8] During the 109th Congress, Congressman Tiberi served as the Chair the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Select Educationa subcommittee with jurisdiction over issues related to international and graduate education programs. The Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)-Positions rated Congressman Tiberi at 50%.[6]
During his first Congressional campaign, Pat Tiberi made the campaign promise to make government more accountable to citizens. During the 110th Congress he supported proposed reforms to make earmarks, lines inserted into a bill that direct money to a member of Congress, more transparent. Congressman Tiberis goal is to introduce reform to give the president the authority to rid congressional bill of unrelated spending in bills.[9] Congressman Tiberi also wants to bring reform through a searchable database that would include an assessment of every piece of federal funding and the Education Oversight Subcommittee that he was appointed Vice-Chairman to in his first year in Congress. Citizens Against Government Waste-Positions gave Pat Tiberi a 78% rating.[10]
Mr. Tiberi introduced a bill with Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) that gives a tax credit to law enforcement officers for any income they earn doing substitute teaching. Messrs. Tiberi and Kind introduced the bill as one way to add security to schools. The bill was introduced in Washington, D.C. on April 12.[11]
Mr. Tiberi received the title of Knight, which was conferred by the Italian ambassador to the United States Claudio Bisogniero, in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in May 2013.[12] The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italian: Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana) was founded as the senior order of knighthood by the second President of the Italian Republic, Luigi Einaudi in 1951.[13]
In 2014, Tiberi cosponsored legislation called the Save American Workers Act of 2013 that would make a 40 hours, instead of 30, the standard definition of full-time work.[14]
On April 10, 2014, Tiberi introduced the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased the cap on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from taxable income.[15] The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.[16]
In 2000, Tiberi ran for and won the House seat that was vacated by nine-term incumbent and Chairman of the House Budget Committee John Kasich, who retired to work as a consultant for Lehman Brothers. He only won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich's long tenure. However, Tiberi hasn't faced a close race since, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census. In 2006, Tiberi won reelection after defeating former Democratic Congressman Bob Shamansky.
Tiberi defeated Democrat David Robinson.
Tiberi defeated Democratic nominee Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks in the general election.
Tiberi defeated Democratic nominee James Reese and Green party nominee Robert Fitrakis in the general election.
Congressman Tiberi recently spoke at a Ripon Society forum and addressed the 2013 IRS scandal and tax reform. Tiberi declared the IRS is one of the worst scandals he has seen in American history, stating that ""...its not like any other. It has Democrats, non-political independents, business owners, other individuals and people who dont pay attention to government, kind of on their toes, because they know it can happen to them."" The Congressman went on to say that the only way out was to show bipartisan partnership among the Administration in order to ""...get this scandal off the front page [and] working with Republicans to get comprehensive tax reform done in a way that simplifies our code.""[19]"

The district, numbered as the 17th district from 2003 to 2013, takes in a large swath of northeast Ohio, from Youngstown to Akron. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He previously served in the Ohio Senate.


Tim Ryan was born in Niles, Ohio and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Warren, where he played football as a quarterback[1] and coached junior high basketball. Ryan is of Irish and Italian ancestry. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Bowling Green State University in 1995 and was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 2000, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire.[2] Ryan served on the staff of controversial U.S. Representative Jim Traficant (D-Ohio) in the mid-1990s. From 2000 to 2002 he served half a term in the Ohio State Senate.
After Jim Traficant was convicted on criminal charges in 2002, Ryan declared his candidacy for the 17th District. As the result of redistricting following the 2000 census, the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed to the west and now included much of Portage County and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th District, represented by eight-term Democrat Tom Sawyer. The 14th had been eliminated in the year 2000 redistricting; most of it was drawn into the 13th District of fellow Democrat Sherrod Brown, but Sawyer's home was drawn into the 17th. In the 2002 Democratic primary, Ryan defeated Sawyer, who was seen as insufficiently labor-friendly in the newly-drawn district. In the November 2002 general election, he faced Republican Insurance Commissioner Ann Womer Benjamin as well as Traficant, who ran as an independent from his prison cell. He won with 51 percent of the vote, besting Benjamin by a solid 14-point margin. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age. He has been reelected five times, [3][4] only once facing another contest nearly as close as his first one. In 2010, he was held to 53 percent of the vote; Traficant, running as an independent, took 16 percent of the vote. It is the only time since Ryan's first run for the seat that he has not tallied at least 70 percent of the vote.
In his first year in office, Ryan was one of 7 members of Congress who voted against the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, and one of 8 Congressmen who opposed ratification of FTC's establishment of a National Do Not Call Registry.[5]
Ryan is a member of the ""30 Something"" Working Group,[6] which is a Congressional caucus that includes those members of the United States House of Representatives who are Democrats and have not yet reached the age of 40. It was organized by the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to energize and engage younger people in politics by focusing on issues that are important to them.[7]
Ryan voted for the Stupak Amendment restricting federal funding for abortions. In March 2010, he stated that he would vote ""Yes"" on the Senate version of the Health Care bill lacking Stupak Amendment language.[8] In January 2015, Ryan announced that having ""gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and emotions that accompany the difficult decisions [about whether to end a pregnancy]"" over his time in public office, he had reversed his position on abortion and now identified as pro-choice.[9]
Before the 2004 presidential election, Ryan spoke on the House floor in an impassioned speech denouncing the Bush administration's denial of a draft reinstatement, comparing this to the administration's previous claims that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction, the Bush tax cuts would create jobs, and other such claims.[10] He repeated in September 2006 with an equally-heated speech criticizing what he felt to be the Bush administration's tendency to distract the public from key issues like the war in Iraq and the economy.[11]
In 2010, Ryan introduced the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which sought punitive trade tariffs on countries, notably China that, were engaging in currency manipulation. It passed the House overwhelmingly but never made it to the floor in the Senate. In an October 2010 interview with conservative magazine Human Events, Ryan said tax increases on small businesses were necessary ""because we have huge deficits. We gotta shore up Social Security. We gotta shrink our deficits"".[12]
Ryan has been repeatedly mentioned as a potential candidate for Governor of Ohio or for the Senate.[13]
Ryan is a member of the following committees:
Ryan is a member of the following caucuses:
In March, 2012, Hay House published Ryan's A Mindful Nation,[14] a book about the practice of mindfulness in both private and public life. He writes in his introduction:
If more citizens can reduce stress and increase performanceeven if only by a littlethey will be healthier and more resilient. They will be better equipped to face the challenges of daily life, and to arrive at creative solutions to the challenges facing our nation.
In October 2014, the same publisher published Ryan's ""The Real Food Revolution"".[15]"

""Jim"" Renacci /rnesi/ (born December 3, 1958) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 16th congressional district since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he is an Ohio entrepreneur and served for a time as Mayor of Wadsworth, Ohio.[3]
On November 6, 2012, Renacci defeated Betty Sutton, as redistricting forced the two incumbents to run against each other. Sutton was defeated by a vote of 181,137 to 165,636 in the new, Republican-leaning district.


Jim Renacci was born December 3, 1958, in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Renaccis father was a railroad worker and his mother was a nurse. Renacci earned a degree in business administration from Indiana University of Pennsylvania and became a Certified Public Accountant and financial advisor.[4]
A self-made millionaire, Renacci is currently worth between $35 and $100 million and made salary, interest and other income of between $500,000 and $4.3 million in 2008 and 2009.[5] In June 2006, the Ohio Department of Taxation assessed Renacci $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties for disclosed but unreported year 2000 income.[6] Renacci stated that the dispute stemmed from a change in Ohio tax policy which he disputed. He and his wife paid the State of Ohio more than $1.3 million, along with approximately another 1000 Ohio citizens who also fought the dispute.[7]
In 2003, Renacci formed the LTC Companies group, a financial consulting service which included a partial ownership of three Harley-Davidson dealerships in Columbus, the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion in Columbus, and Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth.
Renacci and LTC, over almost 30 years, have been a party in multiple legal cases,[7] including two wrongful death suits related to Renacci's nursing home business,[8] and a complaint filed by more than a half-dozen temporary employees alleging they were not paid for work they did for Renacci's medical billing firm.[9] In all cases, Renacci either settled out of court or the case was dismissed.[8]
Renacci became a partner and managing board member of the former Arena Football League's Columbus Destroyers. The team finished the 2007 season as the AFL Eastern Conference Champions with Renacci as President and General Manager.[10] Renacci also served as AFL Executive Committee Vice Chairman and is a partial owner of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team.
Renacci announced on August 24, 2009 that he would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in Ohio's 16th district,[11][12] officially filing on January 11, 2010.[13] Renacci ran as a ""Contender"" of the National Republican Congressional Committee in its ""Young Guns"" program.[14] Renacci defeated Democratic incumbent John Boccieri by 52% to 41% with 6% of the vote going to Libertarian candidate Jeffrey Blevins.
In a town-hall forum in Canton, in September, 2010, Renacci was accused of stating that civil rights issues should be addressed by local governments, stating that the solution is ""to get our federal government out of the way"" because ""it's not the federal government's job"". But a reporter from the Christian Science Monitor who was at the event noted Renacci's words were twisted by a reference to the blight in local communities.[15][16][17][18]
The Plain Dealer reported in September 2011 that the new district map of Ohio would place Congressman Betty Sutton in a largely Republican district that's being constructed to favor Renacci.[19] In December, Sutton filed to run against Renacci.[20] Later that month, Roll Call reported that a poll taken at least two months earlier showed the two congress members neck and neck at 45 percent.[21] On the Washington Post's list of top 10 House races in 2012, Sutton's was at #8.[22]
According to the Sunlight Foundation, Sutton had the highest staff turnover rate in the House.[23] The group's examination of House pay records for two years ending in the third quarter of 2011. reported the Plain Dealer, found that just 19 percent of Sutton's staffers remained throughout the period. The average House office had a 64.2 percent retention rate during that time, the study found.[24]
Renacci defeated Sutton by a 52% to 48% margin on Election Day.
In May 2012, a Renacci campaign contributor was the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into $100,000 of campaign contributions made by employees of an Ohio-based direct marketing corporation, Suarez Corporation Industries, to Renacci's campaign. Many of the non-executive employees had never donated to a campaign before and owned modest homes, yet were reported as donating the maximum legal amount of $5,000 to Renacci. The investigation was sparked by prior Toledo Blade reports of the alleged violations of federal campaign finance law prohibiting a donor from contributing in another's name and prohibiting a corporation from using bonuses or other methods of reimbursing employees for their contributions. Renaccis campaign returned all of the donations.[25][26]
In the 112th congress, Renacci served on the Committee on Financial Services, as vice chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, and a member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. [29]

In the wake of the latest outbreak in May that cost 48 lives, it is painfully clear that we must do more.""[15] Bridenstine claimed 30 times more money was being spent on climate change research than on weather forecasting and warning, a claim that is not true.[16]"

He owns several businesses, including Mullin Plumbing, which he took over from his father when he was 20 years old. Mullin, a member of the Republican Party, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2012 elections, succeeding Dan Boren.


Mullin was born on July 26, 1977 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1] He graduated from Stilwell High School in Stilwell, Oklahoma.[2] He attended Missouri Valley College in 1996.[1]
Mullin took over the family business, Mullin Plumbing, from his father at age 20, when his father fell ill.[2] When Mullin took over the business, they had six employees and had over $500,000 in debt. He expanded the company into a statewide business with more than 100 workers.[3] Mullin owns several other businesses, including Mullin Properties, Mullin Farms, and Mullin Services.[4] Mullin received his Associate in Applied Science in construction technology from Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology in 2010.[1] He hosted House Talk, a home improvement radio program based in Tulsa station KFAQ and syndicated across Oklahoma.[1][5]
Despite description of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as a horrible waste of tax dollars, Mullin's plumbing business took approximately $370,000 of government funds from that program.[6]
Incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Dan Boren decided to retire in 2012.[7] Mullin declared his candidacy for the 2012 elections to the United States House of Representatives to represent Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district in September 2011. In the six-candidate Republican primary, Mullin ranked first with 42% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold. State Representative George Faught ranked second with 22% of the vote.[8] In the run-off primary election, Mullin defeated Faught 57%-43%.[9][10]
The second has historically been a classic ""Yellow Dog"" Democratic district. However, it has steadily trended Republican as Tulsa's suburbs have spilled into the northern portion of the district. Additionally, it has always had a strong social conservative tint. For these reasons, Mullin was thought to have a good chance of winning the election. In the general election, Mullin defeated Democrat Rob Wallace, a former District Attorney, 57%-38%.[11] He became the first Republican to represent the district since Tom Coburn in 2001,[12] and only the second since 1921.
Mullin has vowed to serve no more than six years (three terms) in Congress.[3] He does not consider himself a traditional politician; his campaign slogan was ""A rancher. A businessman. Not a politician!""
On January 20, 2013, the CNN Politics Political Ticker stated that death threats have been made, of some type, for as yet unspecified motives, against Mullin and his family. Law enforcement authorities reportedly considered the threats serious enough due to their nature to take precautions to ensure his and his family's safety. The FBI, local law enforcement, and the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating.[13]
On February 5, 2014, Mullin introduced the bill To revoke the charter of incorporation of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma at the request of that tribe (H.R. 4002; 113th Congress), which would accept the request of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to revoke the charter of incorporation issued to that tribe and ratified by its members on June 1, 1940.[14]

Mullin is Pentecostal. He and his wife, Christie, live in Westville, a few miles from the Arkansas border, and have five children.[1][15] He is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, and is one of two Native Americans in the 113th Congress. The other Native American is fellow Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation.[16]"

He is a member of the Republican Party and chairs the House Committee on Agriculture. His district, numbered as the 6th district from 1994 to 2003, is the largest congressional district in the state and one of the largest in the nation that doesn't cover an entire state. It covers an area of 34,088.49 square miles and stretches from the Panhandle to the fringes of the Tulsa suburbsalmost half of the state's land mass.


Lucas is from Cheyenne, a town in western Oklahoma. He graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1982 with a degree in agricultural economics.
He first ran for the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1984, narrowly losing. A second attempt in 1986 also fell short, but he won the seat in 1988.
On April 7, 2014, Lucas introduced the Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress) into the House.[1] The bill would reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through 2018 and amend some provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[2][3]
In 1994, 6th district Congressman Glenn English stepped down to become a lobbyist for rural electric cooperatives. Lucas won the Republican nomination for the special election on May 10. He faced Dan Webber, press secretary to former Governor and U.S. Senator David L. Boren, now president of the University of Oklahoma. The 6th was already the largest in the state, stretching from the Panhandle to the town of Spencer, in the far northeastern Oklahoma City metropolitan area. However, the state legislature had redrawn it so that it included many poor Oklahoma City neighborhoods that had never voted Republican. Lucas scored a major upset; he won by eight percentage points, carrying 18 of the district's 24 counties. His victory has been seen by some pundits as an early sign of the wave six months later that saw the Republicans take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Lucas himself won a full term in that wave and has been re-elected seven times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote, and even ran unopposed in 2002 and 2004.
Lucas' district was renumbered as the 3rd after Oklahoma lost a district in the 2000 Census. His district, already by far the largest in the state, was made even larger. He lost most of his old district's share of Oklahoma City, which was home to 60 percent of the district's population. He once represented much of the downtown area, including the site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. He still represents that portion of the city located in Canadian County. To make up for this large population loss, the 3rd was pushed further to the east, picking up part of the Tulsa area (including a small portion of Tulsa itself) and some rural areas. As a result, his district now includes 48.5 percent of the state's land mass, and is large as the state's other four districts combined.
In the 2014 Republican primary, Lucas won 83% of the vote. 12% went to Robert Hubbard; and 5% went to Timothy Ray Murray.[4]
Frank has three children and one grandchild with his wife Lynda.[6]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. He is a Deputy Majority Whip. The chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 2006 to 2008, he was, during his tenure, the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the House. As of 2012, Cole  a member of the Chickasaw Nation  is one of only two registered Native Americans in Congress (the other being fellow Oklahoman Markwayne Mullin).


Cole was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Helen Te Ata (ne Gale) and John D. Cole.[1] He is a fifth-generation Oklahoman, having been raised in Moore, Oklahoma. He graduated from Grinnell College in 1971 with a B.A. in history. His postgraduate degrees include an M.A. from Yale University (1974) and a Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma (1984), both in British history. Cole did research abroad as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow and was a Fulbright Fellow (197778) at the University of London. He was a college professor in history and politics before becoming a politician.
Following his mother Helen, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole served in the Oklahoma Senate from 1988 to 1991, resigning mid-term to accept a job in Washington. From 1995 to 1999, he was Oklahoma's Secretary of State under Governor Frank Keating, and assisted with the recovery efforts following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He has also served as Chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party.
Cole has been heavily involved in national politics as well, having served both as Executive Director of the NRCC and as Chief of Staff of the Republican National Committee (RNC).
Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the United States Chamber of Commerce, but his primary involvement in politics was as a political consultant for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in the reconstruction of Oklahoma's political landscape, and backed a number of candidates that took office during the Republican Revolution of 1994. Among their clients have been Keating, J.C. Watts, Tom Coburn, Frank Lucas, Mary Fallin, Wes Watkins, Steve Largent, former Mississippi congressman Chip Pickering, and Hawaii governor Linda Lingle.
During his initial campaign for the House of Representatives in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win a hard-fought general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts. Cole subsequently won easy re-election campaigns in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.
His voting record during his nine years in the House marks Cole as a solid conservative with occasional libertarian sympathies. He has consistently voted pro-life and pro-business positions, and established himself as a supporter of free trade, gun rights, the military, veterans, and American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds. In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912 which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions. The legislations passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.[2]
Cole has consistently voted against positions supported by lobbies for senior citizens, labor unions, and teachers' unions. However, he was critical in brokering protections for DOD civilian workers.[1]
In June 2013, after another failure of the United States farm bill in Congress, Cole called the failure of the legislation inexcusable. His district in Oklahoma includes some of the states farming communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.[3]
As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress).[4] The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.[5] According to Cole, the bill meets its goals ""in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion.""[6]
As of the 114th United States Congress, Tom Cole is a member of the following U.S. House committees:
In 2013, Cole introduced the Home School Equity Act for Tax Relief. The bill would allow some homeschool parents to take tax credits for purchasing classroom materials.[8]
Cole and his wife, Ellen, have one son, Mason. He is a member of the United Methodist Church and lives in Moore.
Cole has said, ""I was raised to think of myself as Native American and, most importantly, as Chickasaw.""[9]
Cole has said that a great-aunt of his was the Native American storyteller Te Ata.[9]
Cole has said, ""... [My] mother Helen Cole[10] was... extraordinarily proud of our Native American history and was, frankly, the first Native American woman ever elected to state senate in Oklahoma.""[9]

Russell was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Clyde E. ""Gene"" Russell and Donna J. Porter Russell on May 25, 1963. Russell grew up in Del City, Oklahoma. The youngest of three, Russell nearly died at birth due to an opposite blood type with his mother. After weeks of intensive care, he recovered and would face several other brushes with death. At the age of seven, Russell was nearly killed by the deadly tornado that hit near Lake Eufala, Oklahoma on June 11, 1970 while visiting his grandparents. Later that year, Russell nearly died from a ruptured appendix and underwent two surgeries with weeks of intensive care at Midwest City Hospital.
Russell attended school at Del City Elementary and Kerr Junior High. He became a Christian reading a Gideon's New Testament he picked up at Kerr in 1977. Graduating from Del City High School in 1981, Russell was President of his senior class and voted most likely to succeed.[3] After earning a four-year Army ROTC scholarship, Russell attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. After graduating with a degree in Public Speaking, Russell was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Infantry.
Receiving his Infantry training at Fort Benning, Georgia, Russell married Cindy Myers, whom he met at Ouachita, on December 21, 1985. Russell would graduate from the U.S. Army Infantry School Officers Basic Course, Airborne School, Mortar School and a year later from the rigorous U.S. Army Ranger School in Class 1187.[4]

During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Russell commanded the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry 'Regulars' and conducted combat in Tikrit, Iraq from the spring of 2003 to the spring of 2004. His task force was a part of Colonel James Hickey's 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. Russell's battalion was broadly covered during the first year of the war by CNN, Fox News Channel, ABC, NBC, CBS, TIME, Associated Press and Reuters. His unit was a central player in the hunt and capture of Saddam Hussein and has been featured in the Discovery Channel's Ace in the Hole[5] and BBC Panorama's 'Saddam on the Run' documentaries.
Russell is highly decorated,[6] having received the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with Valor Device[7] and Oak Leaf Cluster, the Combat Infantryman's Badge and his unit in Iraq was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for its role in the hunt and capture of Saddam Hussein.[8]
Turning down a Queen's University Fellowship to Kingston, Canada for the U.S. Army War College and promotion to Colonel, Russell retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 2006. He returned to Oklahoma with his wife and five children.
Russell began an active veterans advocacy career upon retirement and worked closely with other veterans to bolster the soldiers voice in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He formed Vets for Victory with several decorated warriors holding rallies in several states to embolden the public to support the troops.[9] Russell also toured the country with many distinguished and highly decorated veterans such as David Bellavia, author of House to House; Marcus Luttrell, author of Lone Survivor; Jeremiah Workman, author of Shadow of the Sword; and Sean Parnell, author of Outlaw Platoon.[10][11]

He was also the lawmaker most known for the defense of the 2nd Amendment, restoring lost firearms freedoms and as a staunch defender of the Bill of Rights. Shortly after the publication of his book, Russell announced he would not seek reelection and he decided to focus on his business, public speaking and veterans advocacy.[21]
In January 2014, Russell announced he would seek the seat of the United States House of Representatives in Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, which was being vacated by James Lankford in his US Senate bid.[22][23] On June 24, 2014, Russell led the field in the six-way Republican Primary.[24] On Tuesday, August 26th, 2014, Russell won a major victory despite being heavily outspent to win the Republican nomination.[25] On November 4th, 2014, Russell was elected to Congress with 60.1% of the vote, handily defeating Democratic State Senator Al McCaffrey and three Independent candidates, Buddy Ray, Tom Boggs and Robert Murphy.[26]

She is the U.S. Representative for Oregon's 1st congressional district and was first elected in a special election on January 31, 2012. The district includes most of Portland west of the Willamette River, as well as all of Yamhill, Columbia, Clatsop, and Washington counties.
Bonamici previously represented District 17 in the Oregon State Senate from 2008 to 2011.[1] She was first elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 2006.


Bonamici was born in Detroit and raised in a small Michigan town. Her father worked for a local bank and her mother was a small-business owner and piano teacher. She earned an A.A. from Lane Community College, a B.A. in journalism from the University of Oregon, and a J.D. from the University of Oregon School of Law.
During college, she was a legal assistant at Lane County Legal Aid in the city of Eugene. After getting her law degree, she became a consumer protection attorney for the Federal Trade Commission in the nation's capital. She went into private practice in Portland and represented small businesses.[2]
In 2006, incumbent Democratic State Representative Brad Avakian decided to retire to run for the Oregon Senate. She ran for the open seat in Oregon's 34th House District and defeated Republican Joan Draper 62%-36%.[3]
On April 30, 2008 Bonamici was appointed by Commissioners from both Washington and Multnomah counties to represent Oregon's 17th Senate District. The seat became vacant when Avakian was appointed Commissioner of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries.[4] She was sworn in on May 19, 2008.
Bonamici was unopposed in the November 2008 special election for the balance of Avakian's four-year term, and was elected with 97 percent of the vote.[5] In 2010, she won re-election with 64% of the vote.[6]
In the 2009 Legislative Session, Bonamici served as the Chair of the Senate Consumer Protection and Public Affairs Committee and as a member of the Senate Judiciary and Education Committees.
In early 2011, Bonamici's name was floated as a possible successor to then-Congressman David Wu after The Oregonian and Willamette Week reported Wu exhibited odd behavior and clashed with his staff in the midst of apparent mental illness during the 2010 election cycle.[7] Following Wu's resignation from Congress, Bonamici announced her candidacy for the special election to replace him,[8] touting endorsements from former Governor Barbara Roberts, former Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse, and incumbent Oregon Attorney General John Kroger, among others.[9]
On November 8, 2011, Bonamici won the Democratic Party of Oregon's nomination, winning an outright majority of the vote in every county in the district and capturing 66% of the vote overall, with a 44-point margin over second-place finisher Brad Avakian.

He is a member of the Republican Party. He is the only Republican representative in the state of Oregon.
The district covers more than two-thirds of the state (generally, east of the Cascades). He is the son of Paul E. Walden, three-term Oregon state representative.[1]


Walden earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Oregon in 1981.[2] Before being elected to Congress, Walden owned and ran radio stations.
Walden served as Press Secretary and Chief of Staff to Congressman Denny Smith from 1981 to 1987. He was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the Oregon State Senate to fill a vacancy. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. However, upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate. Their son died soon after birth.[3]
In 1996, Walden announced he was running for the 2nd District as an independent. The district's freshman Republican incumbent, Wes Cooley, whose 1994 campaign Walden had managed, had been caught in several lies about his military service. Cooley's reelection chances were already in serious jeopardy, but it was generally believed that an independent bid by Walden would allow the Democrats to sneak up the middle and win a seat they hadn't held since 1981.[citation needed] Ultimately, the Republicans persuaded Cooley's predecessor, Robert F. Smith, to come out of retirement.[citation needed]
Smith didn't run for reelection in 1998, and endorsed Walden as his successor.[citation needed] Walden easily won the Republican primary and breezed to election in November and has been reelected five times. Though his district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as Ashland, most of the district leans heavily Republican, and Walden has always been reelected easily. In 2002, he defeated Democrat Peter Buckley, who later became a member of the Oregon House of Representatives. In 2006, Walden defeated Democratic candidate Carol Voisin, and in 2008 he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and Pacific Green Tristin Mock. Following the defeat of Senator Gordon Smith in the 2008 elections, Walden became the only Republican to represent Oregon in the United States Congress.
Walden has been chosen by Speaker John Boehner to be chairman of the House Majority Transition Committee. He served as chairman of the House Republican Leadership through most of 2010.[4]
Following the 2012 Elections, Walden became chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. In July 2014, he announced he would seek a second term as chairman of the committee, arguing he would help provide continuity in a changing leadership team after the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. [5]
From 2010 to 2011, Walden gave up his seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, at Republican leadership request so that Parker Griffith, who had recently switched parties, could take his spot on that committee.[6]
Walden founded the Small Brewers Caucus (see Alcohol in Oregon) and the Digital Television Caucus; as of 2007, he was a member of 39 congressional caucuses:[7]
Walden is also a member of the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership.
The following is an incomplete list of legislation that Walden introduced into the House of Representatives.
Walden and his wife, Mylene, live in Hood River with their son Anthony. They are members of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and participate in local civic groups such as the Rotary Club and the Chamber of Commerce.[citation needed]
Walden is a licensed amateur (ham) radio operator, W7EQI.[16]
On October 20, 2009, it was reported that Walden was the first Member of Congress to contract the H1N1-A (Swine Flu) Virus.[17]
On January 31, 2007, Walden sold Columbia Gorge Broadcasting, which runs five stations in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, to Bicoastal Columbia River LLC in order to avoid any conflict of interest that might arise with his congressional duties.[18]"

In 1966, he graduated from Centennial High School on the eastside of Portland and then enrolled at Lewis & Clark College in the southwest part of the city.[1] He majored in political science and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lewis & Clark in 1970.[2] Blumenauer completed his education in 1976 when he earned a Juris Doctor degree from the school's Northwestern School of Law (now Lewis & Clark Law School).[3] Starting before law school in 1970 and continuing until 1977, he worked as an assistant to the president of Portland State University.[1][4]
In 1969-70, Blumenauer organized and led Oregon's ""Go 19"" campaign, an effort to lower the state voting age (while then unsuccessful it supported the national trend which soon resulted in the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution which lowered the voting age to 18). In 1972, he was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat representing District 11 in Multnomah County.[5] He won re-election in 1974 and 1976, and continued representing Portland and Multnomah County until the 1979 legislative session.[1] From 1975 to 1981 he served on the board of Portland Community College.[1] Following his time in the Oregon Legislature, he served on the Multnomah County Commission from 1979 to 1986.[1] He lost a race for Portland City Council to Margaret Strachan in 1981. He left the county commission in March 1986 to run again for city council.[6]
Blumenauer was elected to the Portland City Council in May 1986.[7] His first term began in January 1987,[8] and he remained on the council until 1996.[4] From the start of his first council term, he was named the city's Commissioner of Public Works,[4] which made him the city council member in charge of the Portland Bureau of Transportation (also known as the Transportation Commissioner).[9] During his time on the city council Blumenauer was appointed by Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt to the state's commission on higher education, and he served on that board in 1990 and 1991.[10] In 1992, Blumenauer was defeated by Vera Katz in an open race for mayor of Portlandto date, only the second time that Blumenauer has ever lost an election. At the time he was described as ""the man who probably knows the most about how Portland works"", but left local politics to run for Congress.[11] After winning election to Congress, he resigned from the city council in May 1996, to take up his new office.[12] In 2010, Earl Blumenauer received The Ralph Lowell Award for outstanding contributions to Public Television.[13][14]
Blumenauer was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1996 in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the election of then-U.S. Representative Ron Wyden to the U.S. Senate.[11] He received 69% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark Brunelle.[15] He was elected to a full term that November, and has been re-elected eight more times by wide margins in what has long been the most Democratic district in Oregon. He was most recently reelected in 2012, winning almost 78% of the vote over Republican Ronald Green, who won 16%.[16]
Blumenauer served as Oregon campaign chair for both John Kerry's and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.[17]
In Congress, Blumenauer is noted for his advocacy for mass transit, such as Portland's MAX Light Rail and the Portland Streetcar,[18] and, as a strong supporter of legislation that promotes bicycle commuting, cycles from his Washington residence to the Capitol and even to the White House for meetings.[19]
Among the bills that Blumenauer has sponsored that have become law are the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004[20] and the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005.[21] In addition, the Legal Timber Protection Act passed as part of the 2008 Farm Bill, while the Bicycle Commuter Act passed with the 2008 bailout bill.
He is active in pressuring the United States to take greater action on the Darfur conflict.[22]
In the political aftermath of Hurricane Katrina Blumenauer noted that he was among those who had pointed out the vulnerability of New Orleans and encouraged Congress to help that city and the gulf coast get better prepared:
Blumenauer is a supporter of the World Trade Organization (WTO)[25] and has voted for ""free trade"" agreements with Peru, Australia, Singapore, Chile[26] as well as Africa and the Caribbean.[27] Blumenauer's support for these free trade agreements has angered progressives, environmental and labor activists. In 2004, he voted against the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). On September 24, 2007, four labor and human rights activists were arrested in Blumenauer's office protesting the congressman's support for the Peru Free Trade Agreement.[28]
In February 2009, after an incident in Connecticut wherein a domesticated chimpanzee severely mauled a woman gained national attention, Blumenauer sponsored the Captive Primate Safety Act to bar the sale or purchase of non-human primates for personal possession between states and from outside of the country.[29] The previous year, in June 2008, Blumenauer had sponsored legislation to ban interstate trafficking of great apes, which had passed in the House but been tabled by the Senate.[30]
Blumenauer has received some media attention during the political debate over health care reform for sponsoring an amendment to the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 to change current procedures to mandate that Medicare pay for end-of-life counseling.[31] The amendment, as introduced, is based on an earlier proposal cosponsored by Blumenauer and Republican Representative Charles Boustany of Louisiana.[32] The amendment has generated controversy, with conservative figures as well known as 2008 vice presidential candidate and former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin suggesting that the amendment, if made law, will be used as a cover for the United States federal government to set up ""death panels"" to determine which people will receive medical treatment.[33] Blumenauer sharply criticized the claim as ""mind-numbing"" and called it an ""all-time low"". His rebuke was echoed by Republican Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who scorned the ""death panels"" claim as ""nuts"".[34]
On July 24, 2014, Blumenauer introduced the Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 (H.R. 5195; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize an additional 1,000 emergency Special Immigrant Visas that the United States Department of State could issue to Afghan translators who served with U.S. troops during the War in Afghanistan.[35][36] Blumenauer argued that ""a failure to provide these additional visas ensures the many brave translators the U.S. promised to protect in exchange for their services would be left in Afghanistan, hiding, their lives still threatened daily by the Taliban.""[36]
In 1996, during Blumenauer's first year in congress, he voted in support of the Defense of Marriage Act which was ultimately passed that same year. The law was found unconstitutional in 2013 and repealed.[37]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes Eugene, Springfield, Roseburg and part of Corvallis. As Oregon's most senior member of Congress, he is the dean of Oregon's House of Representatives delegation. A native of Massachusetts and a veteran of the United States Air Force, he previously served as a county commissioner in Lane County, Oregon.


DeFazio was born in Needham, Massachusetts in 1947,[1] a suburb of Boston.[1] He credits his great-uncle with shaping his politics; as a boy, that great-uncle almost never said ""Republican"" without including ""bastard"" at the end (or ""bastud,"" as it usually sounds in the Boston accent).[2] He served in the United States Air Force from 1967 to 1971.[3] He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tufts University in 1969[1] and a Master of Arts degree from the University of Oregon in 1977.[1]
After graduation, DeFazio worked as a gerontologist. From 1977 to 1982, DeFazio worked as an aide for U.S. Representative Jim Weaver.[1] He was elected as a Lane County Commissioner in 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 to 1986.[1]
In 1986, DeFazio ran for Oregon's 4th congressional district, vacated by retiring incumbent Democratic congressman Jim Weaver.[1] DeFazio narrowly won in a competitive three-way primary against State Senators Bill Bradbury and Margie Hendriksen 34%-33%-31%.[4] He won the general election with 54% of the vote.[5]
He didn't face another contest nearly that close until 2010, winning every election before then with at least 61 percent of the vote.[6] He has forged a nearly unbreakable hold on a district which is only marginally Democratic on paper; it narrowly voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004.
DeFazio won 82% of the vote over two minor party candidates.
Earlier, he reportedly considered and re-considered running against Smith for the 2008 Senate election.[7][8][9] On April 20, 2007, DeFazio announced he would not run for Smith's seat.[10]
After Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, it was reported that DeFazio was under consideration for nomination as Obama's Secretary of Transportation.[11] However, fellow U.S. Representative Ray LaHood was named to the post in December 2008.
In 2010, DeFazio was challenged by Republican Art Robinson and Pacific Green candidate Michael Beilstein. As a result of the SCOTUS decision on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a so-called Super PAC group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $300,000 for ads attacking De Fazio and $150,000 for ads attacking Frank Kratovil of Maryland. It was not revealed until the mid-October 2010 quarterly FEC filings that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in Owings Mills, Maryland, and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of Setauket, New York. The FEC filings prior to then listed only a Capitol Hill address and Republican political consultant Jason Miller as treasurer. According to Dan Eggen at The Washington Post, the group claims ""it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'"" The only expenditures have been for these ads.[12][13][14][15]
DeFazio won with 54% of the vote, his lowest winning percentage since he was first elected in 1986.[16] The Oregonian noted that the reelection of DeFazio to his 13th term was more notable for the amount of outside money spent on the campaign than the candidates themselves.[17]
In September 2011, the National Journal cited DeFazio as an example of swing-district Democrats seeking reelection in 2012,"" and who, in begin[ning] to focus on their reelection bids after Labor Day...are increasingly calculating how close is too close to an unpopular President Obama. It also noted that DeFazio's district nearly went for Republican George W. Bush in 2004.""[18]
DeFazio has a progressive voting record. He voted against the Telecommunications Act of 1996one of only 16 congressmen to do so.[19] DeFazio particularly objected to a provision that deregulated the cable television industry. According to DeFazio, many of his fellow Democratic congressmen later realized ""they were idiots"" for backing the bill. He was also the only Oregonian who voted against both NAFTA and GATT.[20][21] In 1995, he challenged President Bill Clinton's stance on Bosnia, claiming Clinton and his Cabinet did not make a convincing claim for the operation. On the issue of abortion, DeFazio is strongly pro-choice, earning a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood in 2010.[22][23] He is a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and was its chairman from 2003 to 2005.
DeFazio has shown a propensity to vote against legislation that would increase the militarism of the United States. In 2000, he voted no on legislation to create a national missile defense network, describing the system as a ""comic book fantasy.""[24] He has consistently voted against the Patriot Act, including its inception after 9/11 and the recurring reauthorization bills, citing the infringement on the civil rights of Americans.[25] He voted multiple times to set an itinerary for exiting Iraq, and to bring the troops home.[26]
In 2008, DeFazio and California Representative Pete Stark signed a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposing a one quarter of one percent transaction tax on all trades in financial instruments, including stocks, options, and futures. Subsequently, DeFazio introduced the ""No BAILOUT Act.""[27][28]
Somewhat controversially, DeFazio declined to support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, voting against the final stimulus package on February 13, 2009. He was one of only seven Democratic House members to vote ""nay"" on the bill.[29][30] DeFazio said that his vote against the bill was due to his frustration over compromises made to win support from moderate Republicans in the Senate, saying, ""I couldn't justify borrowing money for tax cuts,"" in reference to a bipartisan group's decision to cut funding for education and infrastructure initiatives the Oregon congressman had supported in favor of more tax reductions.[31] He also advocated that the U.S. Senate change its cloture rules, doing away with the filibuster that, in the current 5941 Democratic majority, gives Republicans the ability to block legislation from coming to a vote.[32]
DeFazio, speaking to press after the exchange, professed that he was honored that Obama recognized him and the issues of his constituents.[33]
DeFazio made headlines in mid-November 2009 when he suggested in an interview with MSNBC commentator Ed Schultz that President Obama should fire Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers. ""We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get back millions for Americans,"" said DeFazio.[34] The quote made top headlines at progressive news blog The Huffington Post.[35] DeFazio also suggested that a formal call by the Congressional Progressive Caucus for Geithner and Summers to be removed might be forthcoming. A year later he called for the impeachment of Chief Justice John Roberts because of the Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.
In 2009, DeFazio proposed a financial transaction tax for within the United States only (not internationally).[36] (See DeFazio financial transaction tax.)
During his tenure, DeFazio has butted heads with fellow Democratic politicians, including President Barack Obama, on key Democratic legislation. In December 2010, DeFazio told CNN that The White House is putting on tremendous pressure about legislation extending the Bush tax cuts, the president is making phone calls saying this is the end of his presidency if he doesn't get this bad deal. According to The Hill, ""The president hasnt said anything remotely like that and has never spoken with Mr. DeFazio about the issue,"" said White House spokesman Tommy Vietor.[37] In August 2011, Defazio stated the President lacked the fight to follow-through in restoring the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, citing the pressure placed on him by the Republicans as the reason.[38] DeFazio, along with fellow congressman Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bernie Sanders, stated that it would be good for the Democratic party if the president faced a meaningful primary, where all the issues would be aired out.[39]
In October 2011, Think Progress noted that DeFazio, Echoing the demands of the Occupy Wall Street protesters,...is proposing to tax the trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives. DeFazio, along with his Senate co-sponsor Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), has proposed the tax several times in the past. But this time around, the idea is getting a boost of momentum from the popularity of a similar measure in Europe, as well as renewed national media focus on Wall Street profiteering as a result of the 99 Percent Movement.[40]
Also in October 2011, the Daily Caller used DeFazio as an example of the increase in institutional support being enjoyed by the Occupy movement. Speaking on the House floor, DeFazio said, Something is happening. Something in this land is happening. I call it the 'American Awakening.' He added that I think the young people and the others who are joining them on Wall Street get it. They may not be totally focused, but they know that this is not a country that gives them a fair shot at the American dream anymore  it is a stacked deck.[41]
DeFazio opposed the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress), a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.[42] The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.[43][44] DeFazio argued that the bill did not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on ""Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street.""[43] DeFazio called the bill the ""drill everywhere"" bill.[44]
After Senator Bob Packwood resigned in early September 1995, DeFazio ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in a special primary, losing to 3rd District Congressman Ron Wyden. Wyden started out with clear advantages over DeFazio; more seniority, a base in the large Portland media market and more cash on hand in his campaign committee. However, DeFazio's scrappy campaign style, underscored by his TV ads featuring his populist musings while driving in his Dodge Dart, made him a favorite among many Democratic activists.[citation needed] Ultimately, DeFazio lost to Wyden by only 6% in the Democratic primary,[46] despite his early lead of 20%.[citation needed] Wyden, bruised by the primary and trailing State Senator Gordon H. Smith, managed to pull off an upset against Smith in the January 1996 special election.
DeFazio had been mentioned to run for the seat of Senator Mark Hatfield, who announced after the special primary election that he would not seek re-election in 1996. However, faced with the prospect of having to take on well-funded millionaires in both the primary and general election, DeFazio announced in February 1996 that he would not run.[citation needed]
DeFazio is a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He and his wife, Myrnie Daut,[3] reside in Springfield."

He is a member of the Democratic Party and previously served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly.


Schrader was born in Connecticut and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1973. While at Cornell, Schrader met Martha Northam and the two were married in 1975.[3] Schrader earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from the University of Illinois in 1977. A year later, the Schraders moved to Oregon, and Kurt opened the Clackamas County Veterinary Clinic in Oregon City, to begin his veterinary practice.[3]
Schrader served for 16 years on the Canby Planning Commission.
After winning his first election in 1996, Schrader served four terms in the Oregon House of Representatives. Schrader ran for the Oregon House of Representatives in 1994, where he lost to Republican Jerry Grisham in the general election by 38 votes.[4] In 1996, Schrader ran again; and this time defeated Paul Kraxburger.[5] He was subsequently reelected to the House in 1998 and 2000.
In 2002, Schrader ran for the Oregon State Senate seat vacated by the retiring Verne Duncan, representing the 20th district in southwestern Clackamas County, including the cities of Barlow, Canby, Gladstone, Johnson City, Oregon City and portions of Milwaukie. He defeated fellow Oregon House member Kathy Lowe in a contentious Democratic primary, and then faced no Republican opposition in the general election.[6] Martha Schrader was the Democratic nominee to succeed her husband, but lost in the general election to Wayne Scott.[6] She served as a Clackamas County commissioner until 2009, when she was appointed by the same commission (with Martha recusing herself from voting) to replace her husband in the State Senate.[1]
In the Oregon Senate, Schrader served as co-chair of the Joint Ways and Means Committee in the 2003[7] and 2005 sessions, as well as chair of the Interim Joint Legislative Audit Committee in the 2005 session.[citation needed] To prepare for his House seat, Schrader resigned effective December 17.[1]
In May 2008, Schrader won the Democratic nomination for Oregon's 5th congressional district for the seat being vacated by Darlene Hooley.[1] In the general election, Schrader defeated Republican Mike Erickson, winning election to the U.S. House.[8] Schrader won the election with 54 percent of the vote to Erickson's 38 percent. Schrader won all seven of the counties in the 5th congressional district, though he posted a plurality win in Polk County.
Schrader was challenged by Republican nominee and Oregon State Representative Scott Bruun and Pacific Green nominee Chris Lugo. Despite several polls showing Bruun ahead and expert tracker Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight predicting Schrader would likely lose his bid for reelection, the final vote tally had Schrader winning by a fairly comfortable five-point margin, picking up 51% of the vote to Bruun's 46%. It was the closest House race in Oregon in 2010, a year in which Republicans picked up at least 63 House seats, but only one on the West Coast.
Schrader voted for the Budget Control Act. He voted both in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and for funding SCHIP.[9][10]
Schrader is a political moderate, breaking with his party more frequently than 63% of the Democratic Caucus.[11]
On December 17, 2009, Schrader announced that he would become a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.[12]
Representative Schrader is pro-choice and has gotten a 100 rating from both Planned Parenthood and the NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League).[13] In May 2012, Representative Schrader opposed and voted against the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, introduced by Republican Representative Trent Franks of Arizona.[14] The bill proposed imposing criminal penalties for giving abortions in special cases, notably when based on gender, race or color of the child or parent.[15]
Representative Schrader has received a score of 66% from the Environment America and an 83% from the Sierra Club for his position on Clean Water.[13] The League of Conservation Voters gave him a score of 93. Representative Schrader is a strong supporter of alternative energy. He, along with Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, helped award a grant in September 2012, from the Department of Energy to the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC). The grant will be used to create a new ocean energy test facility to test wave energy. The expansion of Oregon State Universitys wave energy technology research furthers our tradition of blazing the trail to a secure energy future, Schrader said of the grant.[16]
Representative Schrader received a 100% rating from the Childrens Health Fund. In 2010 he received a 100% from American Public Health Association.[13] He firmly supports the Affordable Care Act. Schrader is the Co-Chair (along with Pennsylvania Representative Allyson Schwartz) of the New Dem Health Care Task Force, which set forth an agenda of increasing the health care system efficiency to more effectively implement health care policy in this country that improves payment and delivery systems Representative Schrader said. The New Democrats introduced legislation to improve research for doctors and nurses to give them tools to make the best decisions for their patients. Under the leadership of Representative Schrader, this legislation was included in the Affordable Care Act.[17]
Schrader coauthored the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2014 (H.R. 1528; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify that veterinarians are not required to have separate registrations to dispense controlled substances outside of their principal place of business, such as when treating animals on a farm.[18][19][20]
Schrader and former Oregon state senator Martha Schrader divorced in 2011.[3][21] Every one of Schrader's predecessors in the 5th District has also divorced while serving in that office: Denny Smith, Mike Kopetski, Jim Bunn and Darlene Hooley.[22] He has five children.[23]
Schrader's district residence is the Kraft-Brandes-Culberston Farmstead in Canby, also known as Three Rivers Farm, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[24]"

""Bob"" Brady (born April 7, 1945) is the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district, serving since 1998, and the ranking Democrat on the United States House Committee on House Administration since 2007. He has been the Chairman to the Philadelphia Democratic Party since 1986, and is one of the few members of Congress who is also a county chairman (Philadelphia Democratic City Committee).


Brady was born in Philadelphia, the son of Enez (ne Caterini) and Robert G. Brady, a police officer. His father was of Irish descent, and his maternal grandparents were immigrants from Italy.[1][2] He graduated from St. Thomas More High School, but did not attend college, but went to work as a carpenter, becoming a part of the leadership of the union, and remains a member of several unions.[3]
He was elected a precinct committeeman for the Democratic Party in 1968. When wardleader and then-City Council President George X. Schwartz was convicted and imprisoned in the Abscam scandal, Brady was elected to succeed him as Democratic Leader of the 34th Ward, a position that he still holds today.[4] Since June 1986, Brady has been the Chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. He served as a staff aide in the Philadelphia City Council and a staff aide in the Pennsylvania State Senate. Brady has been an instructor at the University of Pennsylvania. He was also a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission from 1991 until his election as a Congressman.
When 17-year U.S. Congressman Tom Foglietta resigned from the House of Representatives upon being named U.S. Ambassador to Italy by Bill Clinton, Brady was unopposed in the primary and won the general election with 74% of the vote. Brady was sworn in on May 19, 1998. He has won re-election since, with at least 81% of the vote.
Brady is pro-choice and voted against President Bush's restrictions on funding to family planning groups in 2001. Over the years, he has supported minors abortion rights, voting in 2005 for the right for those under 18 years of age to obtain abortions across state lines without parental consent.[5] He voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which prohibits health insurance companies from offering abortion coverage in a plan to any citizen. He opposed a proposal to prohibit federally funded abortion services.[6] Over the past fifteen years, organizations such as the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, and Planned Parenthood rated him 100%.[7]
Brady supports the growth of small businesses and voted in favor of the Small Business Lending Fund and Tax Law Amendment. The recent amendment, passed in September 2010, provides loans to small business through financial institutions.[7] He, along with the House, passed the Small Business Jobs Bill in October 2010 to provide millions of small businesses with the tax relief and access to credit that they need to expand, grow, and hire workers.[7]
Brady supports a liberal stance on immigration as well. He voted against the Secure Fence Act (2006), which authorized the construction of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the Immigration Law Enforcement Act of 2006.[7] He does continue to support Homeland Security Appropriations for border protection, in addition to the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Technology project.[7] The program works towards improving the nation's capability to keep track of immigrants and control their entry and exit.[8] Groups such as the National Latino Congreso/William C. Velsquez Institute, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform have rated Brady between 50% and 100% for his pro-immigration political stances.[7]
On January 25, 2007 Brady announced that he would seek the Democratic Party nomination for mayor of Philadelphia. He was the second sitting U.S. Congressman after Chaka Fattah to announce his candidacy for mayor.[9] On March 6, Brady failed to list his city pension on the financial-interests statement he filed with his nominating petitions. Within a week Milton Street filed a petition challenge to remove Brady from the ballot for failing to disclose his pension income. Another challenge was brought by a group of voters, and supported by mayoral candidates Tom Knox and Dwight Evans. On April 13, 2007, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that Brady's failure to not list part of his income would not keep him off the primary ballot.[10] On May 15, 2007, Brady lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Michael Nutter.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. He previously served in the Pennsylvania Senate and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
The district includes portions of North Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia along with Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County.
In late August, Fattah's longtime aide and close confidante Gregory Naylor pleaded guilty to federal charges in a complex money laundering scheme used to hide an illegal million dollar loan that a currently unnamed candidate received for his failed mayoral campaign in 2007 and then paid back using federal grant money intended for nonprofit organizations that Fattah is affiliated with.[2] While Fattah is not specifically named in the so far released documents, the politician described in them challenged campaign fundraising limits in a lawsuit. Since Fattah is the only 2007 mayoral candidate to file such a lawsuit, and since Naylor was his aide at that time, it is clear that the candidate described in the documents is Fattah.[3] A subsequent Philadelphia Daily News investigation revealed that nonprofits receiving federal funding and connected to Fattah paid out over $5.8 million to Fattah allies and alleged that many of these payments are ethically dubious.[4]


Fattah has lived all his life in the city, attending Overbrook High School, the Community College of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government, where he received an MGA in 1986.[5] He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[citation needed]
His parents, David Fattah (born Russell Davenport) and Sister Falaka Fattah (born Frances Brown, also known as Queen Mother Falaka Fattah), are community activists in West Philadelphia, where they are building an ""urban Boys' Town"" through their organization, the House of Umoja.[6] He has five brothers.[7]
Fattah served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1983 to 1988, and as a State Senator from 1988 to 1994.
In 1987, Fattah founded the Graduate Opportunity Initiative Conference, an annual three-day informational and scholarship conference which aims to significantly increase the enrollment of under-represented graduate students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM fields). The conference was designed to encourage minority students interest in STEM graduate and professional schools. More than 12,000 students have been served[citation needed] and notable Pennsylvania participants in the program include Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams and City Council Kenyatta Johnson.[citation needed]
In 1991, then-State Senator Fattah decided to run for the Pennsylvania's 2nd congressional district in the 1991 special election that was held after Democrat U.S. Congressman William Gray decided to resign. On November 5, 1991, Lucien Edward Blackwell won the election with a plurality of 39% of the vote defeating Fattah (28%), John F. White (28%), and Nadine Smith-Bulford (5%).[8]
In 1994, Fattah decided to challenge Blackwell in the Democratic primary. He defeated the incumbent 58%-42%.[9] He won the general election with 86% of the vote.[10] After that, he has been re-elected every two years with at least 86% of the vote. He has never been challenged in the Democratic primary.[11]
Fattah has represented the 2nd district in Pennsylvania, an overwhelmingly Democratic district, in the United States House of Representatives since 1995. Fattah endorsed Barack Obama for President in 2008.[12]
He is the architect of the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs.
In his first years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Fattah introduced and passed into law Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) an early college awareness program. Since its inception, more than $4 billion in federal funds have been distributed to assist 12 million students in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Fattah sponsored H.R. 4207, American Dream Accounts Act which would authorize the Department of Education to award three-year competitive grants to support partnerships that provide financial support and preparation for low-income students as they plan for their college education.[13][14] The bill is co-sponsored in the U. S. Senate by Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Mark Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Specifically the legislation creates personal online accounts for students that monitor higher education readiness and includes a college savings account. The accounts follow students from school to school and through college. Parents can grant vested stakeholders (including counselors, teachers, coaches, mentors, and others) access to the account to update student information, monitor progress, and provide college preparatory support.
Fattah has introduced a few bills targeting the equity of resource allocation within and between school districts. In 2002, he introduced the ""Student Bill of Rights"", H.R. 2451.[15] The measure calls for States to provide highly effective teachers, early childhood education, college prep curricula and equitable instructional resources to all students who attend public schools. Current law requires that schools within the same district provide comparable educational services; this bill would extend that basic protection to the State level by requiring comparability across school districts.
The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act, H.R. 5071  amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to requires school districts to equalize the real dollars spent among all schools within its jurisdiction  with the imperative to raise the resources allotted to schools in the poorest neighborhoods to meet those in well-off schools  before receiving federal aid.[16][17]
Congressman Fattah introduced ""Communities Committed to College"", H.R. 1579.[18] The legislation provides a 50% tax credit to donors who contribute to qualifying scholarship trusts that are recognized and registered with the Secretary of the Treasury.
He also wrote the legislation for the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). The tax credit assists any full-time college or university student or their families that claim the credit. Since 2011, it has assisted 4.5million students and their families.[citation needed] AOTC provides up to $2500 tax credit for families to assist them with the cost of college. The credit is unique in that families under a set income without a tax liability are eligible for a tax rebate. President Obama has called for making the tax credit permanent.[citation needed] Outside of legislative work Congressman Fattah has created a few local education initiatives for Philadelphia and Pennsylvania families as a state legislator and in cooperation with state and municipal governments, including the CORE scholars program and the annual Grad Conference.[citation needed]
College Opportunity Resources for Education (CORE) is a Philadelphia city-wide[which?] initiative providing almost $27 million in last-dollar scholarships to over 18,000 students.[19] The program encourages the students to participate in service to the local community and provides technical assistance to the families of program participants ensuring that they apply for educational assistance programs (Pell Grants, PHEAA grants, etc.) offered by the state and federal government.
A report issued by the National Student Clearinghouse concludes that participants in CORE are more likely than their fellow non-CORE classmates to complete their college education in four years.[20]
Congressman Fattah is the lead Democrat responsible for the funding of the United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney General.[21] Since 2011, the Congressman was able to negotiate an increase of $30M to investment in DOJ programs that fund groups including the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.[citation needed]
In 2012, Fattah negotiated a partnership between FIRST and Boys & Girls Clubs of America to provide robotics programs to 4 million youth by 2015.[22]
Congressman Fattah is the lead Democrat responsible for funding some of the largest science agencies in the federal system (NASA, NSF, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).[23] In December 2011, Fattah through his role on the Appropriations Committee, directed the OSTP to establish an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN].[24] Housed within the White House and chartered on June 20, 2012, the IWGN convenes representatives across the Federal government to make recommendations about the future of neuroscience research.
The Fattah Neuroscience Initiative is a policy initiative designed to make major progress understanding the human brain by intensifying, in a collaborative fashion, federal research efforts across brain disease, disorder, injury, cognition and development.[25] The initiative aims to coordinate Federal research across agencies and draw upon public-private partnerships and the world of academia. The initiative promotes research and discovery across brain cognition, development, disease and injury.
Fattahs priority is ensuring that small and medium businesses have the tools they need to prosper in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. He is the lead Democrat responsible for funding the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. In his role on the Appropriations Committee the Congressman has advocated to $128 million in funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a program that assists small and mid-sized manufacturers create and retain jobs, increase profits, and save time and money. He is also an advocate for the SelectUSA program, an initiative that encourages U.S. businesses operating off-shore to return to the U.S. and promote the U.S. marketplace.[26]
Congressman Fattah is considered a true champion of the co-op movement by the American Co-op Association.[27]
In May 2013, Congressman Fattah introduced the Creating Jobs through Cooperatives Act (HR 2437). This legislation will provide means to catalyze cooperative development,provide tools to entrepreneurs to bring cooperative to their communities,partner with financial institutions to provide grants a loans to developing businesses,offer technical training and professional development.[28] His bill calls for $25 million federal investment and technical assistance to cooperatives through a new National Cooperative Development Center. The bill has national support from co-op and EOB advocates and members.[29] Co-ops have a broad base and connection to community in the Philadelphia area.[30]
In November 2013, Congressman Fattah was invited to attend as Keynote speaker at the Annual Cooperatives Conference, hosted by the NCBA. The conference brought together national leaders in cooperative development to share best practices to create powerful change for their organizations.[31]
As a member of Pennsylvanias state House Fattah wrote and passed into law Pennsylvanias Homeowners Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program (HEMAP).[32] HEMAP is a loan program designed to protect Pennsylvanians who, through no fault of their own, are financially unable to make their mortgage payments and are in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. Started in 1983 by Pennsylvanias Act 91 of 1983, it was only one of its kind until 2010 when Congressman Fattah added language to the Dodd Frank bill to provide similar assistance, to homeowners nationwide.[33] The Emergency Homeowners Loan Program provides up to 24 months of assistance, through bridge loans, for distressed homeowners and is a scaled up version of the HEMAP program.[34][35]
In 2013, Fattah served as a Vice Chair on the House Gun and Violence Taskforce, a taskforce created under the direction of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The taskforce included both liberal and conservative Democrats, gun owners and Representatives from cities plagued with gun violence. Congressman Fattah received an A+ from the Coalition on Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for his positions on gun control.[36][37]
Since 2006, Fattah pioneered gun-buyback programs in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Police. The program offers Philadelphians the chance to turn in guns, no questions asked, in exchange for vouchers for groceries or other goods.[38]
In 2004, Fattah introduced a bill titled the ""Transform America Transaction Fee,"" (H.R. 3759) which proposed to have the U.S. Treasury conduct a one-year feasibility study of a 1 percent transaction fee imposed on transactions made at any financial institution. He touted the possibility that such a system would bring in so much money it would allow for greatly increased federal spending, saying the ""excess funds"" would ""provide universal health care, support an equitable public school finance system, and fund economic development in urban and rural areas,"" in addition to extinguishing the national debt and eliminating all other federal taxes.[39] The bill died without becoming law, or even attracting a single co-sponsor. In 2005, Fattah introduced the bill again with H.R. 1601, and again in 2007 with H.R. 2130 which had a single cosponsor, Democratic Rep. Brian Baird of Washington. Both bills died without any action being taken. In 2009, Fattah introduced a fourth bill to require having a study conducted, H.R. 1703, which attracted no cosponsors. On February 23, 2010, Fattah reintroduced the bill as the ""Debt Free America Act,"" (H.R. 4646) which proposed to repeal the federal income tax and replace it with a 1 percent ""transaction tax"" on every financial transaction  whether paid by cash, credit card or any form of financial transfer, the only exception being transactions involving the purchase or sale of stock.[40] The latest bill places more focus on eliminating the federal debt. Fattah has also added a 1 percent tax credit designed to eliminate the impact of the measure on couples making less than $250,000 a year. As of September 5, 2010, none of the House committees have scheduled any action on the latest bill.
In 2005, Fattah opposed the War in Iraq and supported Congressman John Murtha's call for troop withdrawal.[41] He publicly supported the Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Act a bill that called for bringing the troops home within six months and transitioning the Iraqis to self-government.
In November 2006, he declared his candidacy for Mayor of Philadelphia,[42] where two-term incumbent Mayor John F. Street was barred from re-election by term limits, amid pressure from Democratic voters to keep his Congressional seat in order to maintain a Philadelphia representative on the powerful Appropriations Committee in the House. His candidacy announcement took place next to the recently completed Microsoft School of the Future in the city's Parkside neighborhood to emphasize his campaign platform of better educational opportunities for city youth.
After emerging as a mayoral candidate, Fattah came under fire from the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police for his repeated calls to grant a new trial to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murdering police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981;[43] he also was criticized for possibly unethical campaign spending, based on new campaign finance rules adopted by the city of Philadelphia. The Fattah campaign defended itself, claiming that it had followed less restrictive federal rules in spending the money,[44] but eventually returned a portion of the excess contributions to the exploratory committee following a settlement with the city's Board of Ethics.[44] Fattah eventually came in fourth in the Democratic primary, close behind fellow Congressman Bob Brady but well behind former city councilman Michael Nutter, who went on to win the fall general election handily.
In the 2014 election, Congressman Fattah received 181,141 votes, or 87.7% of the vote, to 25,397, or 12.3%, to his Republican opponent, Armond James, a school teacher with no prior political experience.[45] This was a significant decrease from the 2012 election, when Congressman Fattah received 302,746 votes; more votes than any other member of the House of Representatives and, some researchers indicate, in the history of the House.[46] Fattah was challenged by Republican nominee Robert Allen Mansfield, Jr. and Independent candidate and publisher of the Germantown Newspapers, Jim Foster.[47]

His current wife is Renee Chenault-Fattah, a local Philadelphia television news broadcaster on WCAU-TV (NBC 10).[citation needed] He is the father of three daughters, Frances, Cameron and Chandler, and one son, Chaka Fattah Jr. Chaka Fattah is Baptist.
In 2002, he was named to the PoliticsPA list of Best Dressed Legislators, noting his ""excellence in haberdashery.""[50]
He has also proclaimed that NASA's voting contest for naming rights for a module on the International Space Station should be honored by naming one ""Colbert"" in honor of TV personality Stephen Colbert.[51][52]

On August 1, 2012, Rep. Kelly held a press conference to mark the effective date of the controversial HHS mandate, which is the subject of more than 20 lawsuits and which has been decried by religious freedom advocates as a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In his remarks, he said the mandate was an attack on Americans' constitutionally protected religious rights and that August 1, 2012, would go down in infamy as ""the day that religious freedom died"".[9]
Committee on Ways and Means
In addition, Rep. Kelly is serving as the co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, a bipartisan group of U.S. Representatives from the 18 Northeastern and Midwestern States.

The district includes parts of Delaware County, Chester, and Montgomery Counties. He succeeded Democrat Joe Sestak, who ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate.
Congressman Meehan sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure, Oversight and Government Reform, and Homeland Security Committees. On the Homeland Security Committee, Meehan chairs the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies.
A graduate of Bowdoin College and Temple University, Meehan previously served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (20012008) and as district attorney of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (19962001).


Born and raised in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania by his parents Leo and Julia, and is one of 4, Julia Meehan, Mike Meehan, and Tom Meehan. Pat Meehan attended Bowdoin College in Maine and graduated in 1978 with a Bachelors of Arts (B.A.). While at Bowdoin, he was a standout hockey player and went on to spend two years in the National Hockey League (NHL) as an official. Meehan attended Temple Law School in Philadelphia, and graduated with his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1986.
After he earned a JD in 1986, he went to work as an associate at the law firm Dilworth Paxson LLP.
On July 7, 2008, Meehan announced to his staff that he would be stepping down from his position. On July 16, 2008, Meehan announced that he was joining the Philadelphia law firm of Conrad O'Brien Gellman & Rohn.[1]
Meehans career in public service and politics began in 1979 with the Philadelphia mayoral race working for Republican candidate David Marston. A year later he worked on Roy Zimmerman's campaign for Pennsylvania Attorney General.
Meehan went on to serve as Special Counsel to U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. He was a campaign manager for U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, Philadelphia D.A. Ron Castille, and State Attorney General Ernie Preate.[2]
In 1995 he was elected the District Attorney (D.A.) of Delaware County as a Republican. During Meehan's tenure as DA, his staff prosecuted several high-profile cases, including the Du Pont Murder Trial, (a case involving the murder of Olympic wrestler David Schultz by his millionaire benefactor John Eleuthre du Pont) and the 1996 murder of a 22-year-old college student named Aimee Willard (who was abducted from Route 476 and found in an abandoned lot in North Philadelphia).[2]
While serving as D.A., Meehan set up the Special Victims Unit for Domestic Violence in Delaware County, offered protection from the alleged abusers allowed the prosecution occur without the victims testifying in open-court.[3][citation needed] As D.A. he also focused on protecting youth by expanding the Youth Aid Panel program for first time offenders and creating a truancy project to limit youth-related crime during the day. Meehan established the United States Department of Justices Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) in Pennsylvania. The ICAC is a special unit of detectives that investigate online predators on the web and bring them to justice; it has become a model across the country.
Pat Meehan became the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, six days after the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate. Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staffed backed up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Office. As U.S. Attorney, Meehan has made terrorism, gang-crime, child internet-safety, and public-corruption priorities for his criminal division. Public-corruption in Philadelphia in particular was brought to the spotlight in 2003 when a FBI electronic listening device was found in the Philadelphia Mayors Office.
In light of the 9-11 Attacks, Meehan formed the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF), later renamed the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council (ATAC) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to evaluate and prevent future terrorist attacks. This initiative was done in partnership with local, state and federal law-enforcement and emergency responders. The ATAC has led large-scale table-top and field exercises on biological attacks and the poisoning of the food-supply in partnership with Saint Josephs University in order to help Eastern Pennsylvania to prepare for terrorist attacks.[4][broken citation]
Recognizing the expansion of gang-related activity in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, Meehan sought a $2.5 million dollar Department of Justice grant to fight and prevent gang violence for the region. The unique Route 222 Corridor Anti-Gang Initiative brought together elected officials, federal, state and local law-enforcement with community groups to fight gangs in a rural area unfamiliar with big-city gang violence. The money was divided among enforcement, prevention and rehabilitation. The program aimed not only to increase arrests, but also to fund school programs and community centers to educate youth about the alternatives to gang life.[4][broken citation]
Continuing the work he began while he was Delaware County D.A., Meehan continued to make child safety on the Internet a priority, sponsoring Internet safety training seminars with Web Wise Kids and visiting local schools. Meehans office has prosecuted sub-standard nursing homes and elder care facilities, and nefarious lenders who offered ill-advised loans to disadvantaged homeowners. (Bio) The U.S. Attorneys Office under Meehan has been nationally recognized for its work in the field of health-care fraud. The office has won more than half a billion dollars in settlements against some of the largest pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers, ensuring better self-policing and oversight by the industry.[5][broken citation]
Though he has been active in a wide variety of areas, it has been several high-profile public corruption cases that have put Meehan in the headlines. Philadelphia is well known for its pay to play culture that rewards patronage rather than merit. Since taking office, Meehan and his office have been actively prosecuting corrupt Philadelphia city officials. Meehan has said, ""Pay to play cannot be standard operating procedure in city government.[6]
This was brought to national attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor John F. Streets office and found an electronic listening device. It was later discovered that the bug had been planted by the FBI as part of a city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation. Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia Mayoral Election on November 4, 2003. Streets campaign spokesman went so far as to accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway).[7] Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including Street confidant Ronald White (who later died before he could stand trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.[8]
Other city officials prosecuted by Meehans office included former city councilman Rick Mariano (who was sentenced to six and half years in federal prison for accepting bribes and attempting to influence city contracts), the President of the Independence Seaport Museum John S. Carter (who was sentenced to 15 years for cheating the museum from $1.5 million), Montgomery County accountant Denis Shusterman (for embezzling $10 million, he received a 14-year sentence),[9] and State Senator Vincent Fumo (who has recently been convicted on a 139-count indictment including fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges carrying a ten-year sentence).[10]
Meehan began his campaign for Pennsylvania governor in 2008.[11] On August 7, 2009, however, he announced that he was ending his exploratory bid and would instead run for Congress. Reports indicated that another candidate, Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett, was too far ahead of Meehan in fund-raising and endorsements.[12]
Meehan decided to run in Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district election, vacated by Joe Sestak, who defeated U.S. Senator Arlen Specter in 2010 in the Democratic Party primary, but lost to Republican Pat Toomey in the general election. Meehan ran unopposed for the Republican Party nomination in the May 18, 2010 Republican primary.
To appear on the primary election ballot a candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania is required to collect valid signatures of 1,000 registered voters in the congressional district. When evidence of fraud in some of Meehan's petitions was discovered by the Meehan campaign, Meehan alerted the Delaware County District Attorney. Michael Green, the District Attorney and Meehan supporter, turned over the matter to the office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Because the Attorney General, Tom Corbett, is the Republican candidate for governor, Lentz requested that the United States Department of Justice take over the investigation.[13] Paul Summers, a Republican campaign operative and volunteer, was charged with seven counts of forgery and seven counts of making false signatures.[14] He was convicted on seven of the charges after pleading guilty as part of a plea-bargain deal.[15]
Meehan defeated Democratic State Representative Bryan Lentz 55%-44%.[16][17][18]
Meehan won re-election to a second term with 60% of the vote over Democrat George Badey.[19]
Meehan was sworn in on January 5, 2011. He was appointed to serve as one of just three freshman members on the House Republican Steering Committee, and is one of a select few House freshmen to chair a subcommittee. He has joined the Republican Main Street Partnership.[20]
As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Meehan chairs the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. Chairman Meehan has held hearings to investigate issues such as Iran's ties to terrorism and the risks posed by extremists in Pakistan.[21]
Meehan voted to repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As far as fiscal policy, he voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011,[22] Cut, Cap and Balance Act,[23] and voted to defund NPR.[24] Among bills that became law, he voted for the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act[25] and to extend the Patriot Act.[26]
Meehan has introduced the Jump Start for Job Creators Act, legislation that would encourage entrepreneurs to create jobs by increasing the maximum tax deduction for small business start-up expenses.[27] Meehan has led the effort to preserve funding for the V-22 Osprey.,[28] an advanced military aircraft manufactured in Meehan's district.[29]
In June, Meehan announced that six Chester County fire companies in Pennsylvania will receive $430,000 in federal grants to purchase new radios and rescue equipment.[30]
On July 24, 2013, Meehan voted to continue funding an NSA surveillance program gathering metadata from the telephone calls of U.S. citizens.[31]
Meehan supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.[32]
On November 14, 2013, Meehan introduced the Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 3488; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish preclearance facilities, conduct preclearance operations, or provide customs services outside of the United States of America to prevent terrorists, terrorist instruments, and other national security threats from gaining access to the United States.[33]
On February 6, 2014, Meehan introduced the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4007; 113th Congress), a bill that would make permanent the United States Department of Homeland Securitys (DHSs) authority to regulate security at certain chemical facilities in the United States.[34] Under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, DHS collects and reviews information from chemical facilities in the United States to determine which facilities present security risks and then requires them to write and enact security plans.[34]
Meehan introduced legislation, titled the 'Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013' (CIRDA), that passed the subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies in 2013. The bill aims to make key improvements in security for important infrastructure. The measure calls for expansion in research and development for security technology as well as implementing a new strategy in dealing with cyber threats that the Department of Homeland Security faces. This bill would also streamline sharing of these technologies to many other branches of government, thus making them more secure as a whole.[35][36]
In 2013, Congressman Meehan introduced a bill called the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2952; 113th Congress). If signed into law, the bill would require more oversight of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity goals, according to Ripon Advance. The bill would require DHS to transmit to the Congress a strategic plan for research and development efforts addressing the protection of critical infrastructure and a report on departmental use of public-private consortiums to develop technology to protect such infrastructure.[37] On January 16, 2014, the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies passed the bill,[38] and in February the full Homeland Security Committee approved the bill.[39] On July 28, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote.[40][41]
Meehan, his wife Carolyn and their three sons live in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.[42][broken citation]"

""Mike"" Fitzpatrick (born June 28, 1963) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party who serves as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district for from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by Democrat Patrick Murphy in 2006. He declined to seek a rematch with Murphy in 2008 but ran again in 2010, defeating Murphy and reclaiming the seat. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of term limits, he will be retiring in 2016.


Fitzpatrick was born and raised in Bucks County. He graduated from Bishop Egan High School, now Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, in Fairless Hills. He moved to Florida to attend St. Thomas University with an academic scholarship where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1985 from the school's honors program. He then earned his law degree from the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State University. He was named business manager of the Dickinson Journal of International Law.[citation needed]
After graduating law school in 1988, Fitzpatrick was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the Bucks County Board of Commissioners by an 11-member panel of county judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of Mark Schweiker, who had been elected lieutenant governor. Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders.[2] The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party.[3]
In July 2004, popular moderate Republican James C. Greenwood unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood's replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood's choice, state Senator Joe Conti, thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia ""Ginny"" Schrader (something of a ""sacrificial lamb candidate"", chosen before Greenwood withdrew) in the general election.[4][5] Fitzpatrick won the general election against Schrader 55.3%-44.3%, with the remaining vote split between two minor candidates.[6] The Pennsylvania 8th District includes all of Bucks County, a sliver of Montgomery County, and parts of two wards in Northeast Philadelphia.[7]
Fitzpatrick faced Democrat Patrick Murphy in the November general election of 2006.
In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives Bob Ney (R-OH), Tom DeLay, (R-TX), and Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham (R-CA).[8]
Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the Sierra Club. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election.
The Cook Political Report rated the race as ""Leans Republican"". However, Congressional Quarterly pegged the contest as a ""Toss-up"". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.[9]
In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast.
On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.[10] He along with Mike Sodrel (R-IN) and Joe Schwarz (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (the latter albeit in a primary).
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006, which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to ""Commercial Social Networking Websites"" and ""Chat Rooms.""
In late July, the DOPA Act overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, ""The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators"".[11]
Fitzpatrick served on the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Committee on Small Business.
After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firmand major Republican Party contributor[12]Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.[13][14] In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner Andy Warren and former Common Pleas Judge William Hart Rufe to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.[15] The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.
Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy.[16] Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January, 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative Chris King in the 142nd District. Despite charges by some Democrats that he was ""afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose,"" Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his ""passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community,"" as well as a desire to ""change the way business is done in Harrisburg."" [17]
However, family health problems forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist Frank Farry (who went on to win the seat), and supported Doylestown pharmaceutical company executive Thomas Manion for the congressional seat he once held.
On January 23, 2010, Fitzpatrick announced he would once again run for his old seat in the House of Representatives.[18][19] He pledged that if elected, he would only serve for a maximum of three more terms, for a total of four terms. He described Washington, D.C. as ""a town of embedded politicians"" with a seniority system that ""rewards congressmen for political careers lasting decades and encourages members to serve in perpetuity."" He called for ""real reform of house rules and procedures"" and ""congressional term limits.""[20]
He won the Republican nomination with 77% of the vote in the May primary.[21] A Franklin and Marshall poll taken in mid-September 2010 suggested the race was leaning towards Fitzpatrick at that time. On November 2, Fitzpatrick defeated Murphy and was elected the Congressman for the 8th district.[22]
On November 2, 2010, Fitzpatrick defeated Patrick Murphy to reclaim his old seat. He was sworn in on January 5, 2011 and has joined the Republican Main Street Partnership.
Fitzpatrick defeated Kathryn Boockvar 57%43%.[23]
Before the election, Fitzpatrick reiterated a pledge he made in 2010[20] that this will be his last re-election bid, due to self-imposed term limits.[24] In the Democratic primary, former Army Ranger Kevin Strouse defeated businesswoman Shaughnessy Naughton. Fitzpatrick comfortably beat Strouse in the general election. After he won, he again confirmed that he would not run for re-election in 2016.[25]
On January 5, 2011, Fitzpatrick failed to attend the swearing-in ceremony for members and instead attempted to take the oath-of-office remotely at a reception.[26] However, House rules require that the oath be taken within proximity of the Speaker.[26] The oath was administered the following day, but two votes that he cast prior to taking the oath were nullified according to the Constitution.[27][28] Some Congressional ethics experts contend that the reception was in fact a fundraiser and have called for an investigation by the House Ethics Committee.[29][30] A spokesperson for Fitzpatrick denied the event was a fundraiser and asserted that donations made went to cover the cost of campaign-provided buses to Washington.[31]
Fitzpatrick supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.[32]
Fitzpatrick and his wife Kathleen, a former teacher, reside in Levittown, Pennsylvania, with their six children.
He is affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America and is a member of the Temple Lower Bucks Hospital Board of Directors, the Conwell-Egan Catholic Board of Advisors, the Knights of Columbus, the Levittown Bristol Kiwanis Club, the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Brehon Law Society. He is also an eagle scout from the Bucks County Council and former president of that council, and was honored with the Silver Beaver Award for his services to scouting.[33][34]
Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with colon cancer in June 2008. He reported in November 2008 that the cancer went into remission after chemotherapy.[35]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.
The district, located in northern Pennsylvania, includes Bradford County, Juniata County, Lycoming County, Mifflin County, Pike County, Snyder County, Sullivan County, Susquehanna County, Union County, Wayne County, and portions of Perry County, Tioga County, Lackawanna County, Monroe County, and Northumberland County.


Marino was born and raised in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania.[2] Marino received his undergraduate degree from Lycoming College and his juris doctor from Dickinson School of Law.[3]
Marino served as a Lycoming County District Attorney from 19922002, and was then selected as a U.S. Attorney.
In 2007, Marino resigned from office as the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Anonymous sources claimed that Marino resigned his position while under review by the Department of Justice. [4] In 2013, the current US Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Peter Smith, confirmed in United States v. Healy[5] that neither Marino, nor his office, were ever under review or investigation, saying, ""Mr. Marino was never under investigation by this office... there was no investigation of Mr. Marino by the Department of Justice."" [6] After his resignation, Marino accepted a position as an in-house attorney for DeNaples Management for $250,000 per year.[7]
In 2010, Marino decided to challenge incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Chris Carney of Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district. He won the three-candidate Republican primary with 41% of the vote, defeating Dave Madeira (31%) and Snyder County Commissioner Malcolm Derk (28%).[8] On November 2, 2010, Marino defeated Carney 55-45%. He won every county in the district except Luzerne and Lackawanna.[9][10]
After redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn 10th district, which is more reliably Republican and includes more counties in the central part of the state. He won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Philip Scollo 66%-34%.[11]

Jim Sensenbrenner, an author of the Patriot Act, considers un-American.[21]
In August 2014, Marino had a confrontation on the House floor with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, after he blamed her for the current immigration crisis, claiming that she could have dealt with the issue when the Democrats held a majority in both houses of Congress at the beginning of President Barack Obama's first term.

Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Barletta","Lou Barletta","Republican","Mayor of Hazleton","Roman Catholic","Louis J. Barletta (born January 28, 1956) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. He served as Mayor of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, from 2000 to 2010, and as Mayor he was known for his vocal opposition to illegal immigration and his efforts to keep undocumented immigrants out of the city.


Barletta was born in Hazleton, Pennsylvania to Rocky and Angeline Barletta. After graduating from high school, he attended Luzerne County Community College and Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. After an unsuccessful tryout for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team,[3] Barletta went to work for his family's construction and heating oil business.
In 1984, Barletta founded a pavement marking company, Interstate Road Marking Corporation, which he sold in 2000. At the time of the sale, his firm had grown to become the largest of its kind in Pennsylvania.
He was defeated for a seat on the Hazleton City Council in 1996, but won two years later. In 1999, he defeated Jack Mundie for mayor, taking 66% of the vote[4] and overcoming a Democratic registration edge in the city.[5]
Barletta was reelected as mayor in 2003 and 2007. In 2007, Barletta was nominated in both the Republican and Democratic primary elections. Barletta defeated the Democratic candidate, former Mayor Michael Marsicano, on the Democratic ballot as a write-in.[6]
In 2006, Barletta made headlines for his efforts opposing illegal immigration in Hazleton vowing to make the city one of the toughest places in the United States for illegal immigrants.[7] Barletta introduced and the city council approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act.[8] The ordinance allowed the city to deny a business permit to employers who hired illegal immigrants and gave the city authority to fine landlords up to $1,000 for leasing to illegal immigrants.[7][9] The act also made English the official language of Hazleton, prohibiting city employees from translating documents into any language without official authorization.[10] In response, the ACLU and Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund sued in Federal District Court to block the ordinance.[10] In July 2007, District Court Judge James M. Munley ruled that the act was unconstitutional for interfering with Federal immigration laws and violating the due process of individuals, employers and landlords.[7] The ruling was upheld on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals on September 9, 2010.[11] In a public statement shortly after the decision, Barletta vowed to appeal.[12]
In 2002, Barletta ran as the Republican candidate in the 11th District against nine-term Democratic incumbent Paul Kanjorski. The 11th had long been considered the most Democratic district in Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. However, Barletta was viewed as a very strong candidateindeed, the first credible Republican challenger Kanjorski had faced since his 1986 reelection bidsince he was a very popular Republican mayor from a heavily Democratic city. Barletta lost, taking 42.4% of the vote. The race might have been much closer had the state legislature not decided to move heavily Democratic Scranton, previously the heart of the 10th District, to the 11th. Barletta lost the district's share of Lackawanna County, home to Scranton, by 32 points; he only trailed in the old 11th by 9,000 votes.[13]
Barletta faced Kanjorski again in 2008.[14] Multiple polls had shown Barletta leading Kanjorski by as many as 5 percentage points,[15] and the race has been pegged as one of the nation's most competitive leading into the November elections. That race was one of very few nationwide where a Republican challenger had a credible chance at unseating a Democratic incumbent. Barletta lost to Kanjorski 48%-52%,[16] largely due to losing Lackawanna County by 12,800 votes. Barletta won the territory that had been in the district prior to the 2000s round of redistricting by almost 4,000 votes.[17]
Barletta announced on December 9, 2009, that he would once again run for Congress in 2010. He won his party's nomination on Tuesday, May 18, 2010. Barletta won the General Election on November 2, 2010 against Kanjorski by a 55%-45% margin. City Council President Joe Yannuzzi succeeded Barletta as Mayor of Hazleton on December 15, 2010.[18]
Before the 2012 election, it was widely expected that the state legislature would gerrymander Barletta's district to make it safer for him. President Barack Obama carried the old 11th with 57%.[19] The new map, as expected, significantly altered the 11th. Heavily Democratic Scranton and Wilkes-Barre were shifted to the 17th District. To make up for the loss of population, the 11th absorbed some heavily Republican territory to the north and south that had previously been in the neighboring 5th, 10th, 17th and 19th districts, pushing it as far south as the suburbs of Harrisburg. The new district is approximately ten points more Republican than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2008, President Obama would have only won 47 percent of the vote here to John McCain's 51 percent.[20] It appeared that the legislature wanted to protect Barletta by packing as many of northeast Pennsylvania's Democratic voters into the 17th as possible.
Barletta won reelection with 58 percent of the vote.[21]
On April 15, 2011, Barletta voted with the Republican majority for Paul Ryan's budget. Barletta has characterized a balanced budget amendment as a gimmick and said he will not vote to raise the debt ceiling.[22]
On January 31, 2014, Barletta introduced the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act (H.R. 3979; 113th Congress) into the House.[23] The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude volunteer hours of volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel from counting towards the calculation of the number of a firms full-time employees for purposes of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act.[24] This mean that there was no requirement that volunteer emergency responders be offered health care by the organization they volunteer with.[25] Barletta argued that the bill was necessary because the Internal Revenue Service had initially said that it would be requiring organizations to provide these volunteers with insurance, something that would be prohibitively expensive for some of them.[25]"

Keith Rothfus was born in 1962 in Endicott, New York. He graduated from West Seneca West Senior High School in 1980. He attended the State University of New York College at Buffalo for his bachelor's degree in Information Systems. He later earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School in 1994.[4]

Boyle","Democratic","Pennsylvania House of Representatives","Roman Catholic","Brendan Francis Boyle (born February 6, 1977) is a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district, having won 67% of the vote on November 4, 2014. The district covers parts of Philadelphia and Montgomery County. He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 170th District since 2009, and resigned on January 3, 2015 to serve in Congress.[2]


The oldest son of Francis, an Irish immigrant, and Eileen Boyle, Brendan was born and raised in the Olney neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Roman Catholic parochial schools before receiving an academic scholarship to the University of Notre Dame. He graduated from Notre Dame with a degree in Government. He attended graduate school at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, where he earned a master's degree in Public Policy.[3]
Boyle ran unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania House in 2004 and 2006, losing both times to then 20 year Republican incumbent George T. Kenney and being outspent by a nearly 10 to 1 margin. On November 4, 2008, Boyle defeated Republican Matthew Taubenberger, son of 2007 mayoral candidate Al Taubenberger, by a margin of 15,442 (59.2%) to 10,632 (40.8%) to win the election.[4] He became the first Democrat ever elected to represent the 170th House district.[3][5][4]
On November 2, 2010, Boyle won re-election, defeating Republican Marc Collazzo by a margin of 64% to 36%.[6][4]
In 2010, his brother, Kevin, was also elected to a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.[7] Kevin defeated former Speaker of the House John M. Perzel. Brendan and Kevin Boyle made history as the first brothers to serve together in the Pennsylvania House.[8]
For the 2012 election cycle, Brendan Boyle was selected as Chairman of the House Democratic Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of the House Democratic Caucus.[9]
As a state lawmaker, Boyle's focus has been on greater educational access. During his first term in office, he introduced the REACH Scholarship program, which would offer tuition-free public college for qualifying Pennsylvania students. He fought cuts to public K-12 and higher education funding, and has supported greater investment in infrastructure, voting for a 2013 bill that provided the first comprehensive transportation funding overhaul since the 1990s. He was a founding member of the LGBT Equality Caucus during his first term in office. In 2014, he introduced legislation to amend Pennsylvania's hate crimes statutes to include crimes perpetrated based on sexual orientation.[3]
In April 2013, he announced his candidacy for Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district, a seat being vacated by the incumbent congressperson, Allyson Schwartz, who declined to run for reelection to make an unsuccessful run for Governor. Boyle had the support of nearly 30 labor unions across Philadelphia and its environs.[5]
Despite early polling showing a nearly 30 point lead for former Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies in the Democratic primary--the real contest in this heavily Democratic district--Boyle won the May 20, 2014 primary with 41% of the vote. He won the nomination on the strength of taking 69% of the vote in the Philadelphia share of the district. He went on to win the seat in the general election on November 4, 2014, defeating Republican Carson Adcock with 67% of the vote.[10][11]
Brendan is married to Jennifer, a Montgomery County public school teacher; the couple has one child. Kevin Boyle serves as a representative of Pennsylvania's 172nd House district, making them currently the only brothers serving simultaneously in the Pennsylvania General Assembly.[citation needed]
In August 2008, Brendan Boyle was named ""one of top 10 rising stars"" in politics by the Philadelphia Daily News.[12] In 2011, the Aspen Institute chose Boyle as one of its Rodel Fellows,[13] a program that ""seeks to enhance our democracy by identifying and bringing together the nation's most promising young political leaders.""[14]"
"337","","1995","1953","Pennsylvania 14","Penn State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_F._Doyle","Michael Doyle","Democratic","State Senator Chief of Staff","Roman Catholic","Michael F. ""Mike"" Doyle (born August 5, 1953) is the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 14th congressional district, serving in Congress since 1995. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is based in Pittsburgh and includes most of Allegheny County.
A native of Swissvale and graduate of the Pennsylvania State University, Doyle previously served as a member of the Swissvale Borough Council (19771981) and an aide to state Senator Frank Pecora (19791994). He was first elected to Congress in the 1994 Congressional election.


Doyle was born in Swissvale, Pennsylvania, to Irish and Italian parents. He graduated from Swissvale Area High School in 1971, and then enrolled at Pennsylvania State University. He worked in steel mills during his summers in college, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Community Development in 1975.
After college, he worked as executive director of Turtle Creek Valley Citizens Union (19771979) and was elected to the Swissvale Borough Council in 1977. In 1979, he began work as chief of staff to Pennsylvania State Senator Frank Pecora. Like Pecora, Doyle was once a Republican who later switched parties to become a Democrat. In addition to his work for Pecora, he joined Eastgate Insurance Company as an insurance agent in 1982.
Doyle voted against authorizing military force in Iraq and against the $87 billion emergency spending bill to fund US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Doyle is the Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education,[1] also known as the Congressional Autism Caucus, and he offered an amendment that was included in the health reform law that will ensure that insurance companies will cover treatments for people with autism.[2] He has also introduced legislation that will provide better services for adults with autism.
On abortion, Doyle falls into the category of Pro-Choice, voting against bills that would ban abortion,[3] as well as receiving very favorable ratings amongst pro-choice interest groups, such as NARAL, while scoring a 0 with pro-life groups such as the National Right to Life Committee.[4] However, Doyle does not support federal funds to pay for abortions, excepting cases of rape, incest, or when the mothers life is in danger. He does, however, support using federal dollars for Title X, family planning services and support federal funding for Planned Parenthood with the existing provision that federal funds may not be used to perform abortions.[5]
Doyle has fought against gun laws that would allow people to bring firearms into national parks, repeal any part of the assault or military style weapon ban,[5] and voting to maintain parts of the D.C. gun ban.[6] This has led to decreasing ratings with pro-gun interest groups such as the NRA (42% lifetime rating in 2000 to 0% in 2006) and Gun Owners of America. Conversely, he has received overall ratings from pro-gun control groups, receiving a 90% in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence back in 2003.[7]
Doyle supports comprehensive immigration reform, voting for a bill that would repeal certain green card limitations, as well as the DREAM act.[8] These views have got him negative ratings from interest groups such as English First (0%) and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (0%). His immigration reviews resonate stronger with the National Latino Congreso/William C. Velsquez Institute and American Immigration Lawyers Association, in which he has received perfect scores from both groups.[9]
Liberals have praised him for his stance on copyright issues,[10] and is supportive of net neutrality. He is the lead sponsor of HR 1147, the Local Community Radio Act of 2009 which will expand low-power broadcasting to hundreds of new community radio stations. In 2010, he was given the Digital Patriot Award,[11] along with Vint Cerf, one of the creators of the technology that runs the Internet. In February 2013, he became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.[12] Doyle is a strong supporter of letting local governments provide Internet services in order to increase competition, improve service, and decrease prices.[13]
He used his position on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and lead the negotiations to find common ground on legislation addressing climate change and promoting energy independence while protecting clean domestic manufacturing.[14]
Also, Doyle is an outspoken critic of the genocide in Sudan and Darfur. In a rally on April 28, 2007, he urged President Bush to uphold his promise of sending 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur. He drew loud cheers when he said, ""If we can have a surge in Iraq, there needs to be one in Sudan."" He supports LGBT issues.[15]
During the debate over the debt ceiling in 2011, Doyle said about Tea Party Republicans, ""We have negotiated with terrorists. This small group of terrorists have made it impossible to spend any money"".[16]
On October 16, 2012, Doyle released a statement criticized the Republican budget introduced by Paul Ryan, saying that it would be devastating for seniors in Pittsburgh. According to his report, this budget would eliminate new preventive care benefits for 113,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the district, as well as other cuts to Medicaid affordable housing, and food stamps. Thats why I voted against the Ryan budget when it was considered by Congress earlier this year, and why I am fighting hard to oppose Congressional Republicans' misguided priorities.""[17]
In 1994, Doyle was elected to Congress as a Democrat from the state's 18th District, which at the time was located in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh. The incumbent Republican, Rick Santorum, was elected to the United States Senate. Doyle won by almost 10 points, in one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Democrats. He was reelected three times with no substantive opposition.
In 2002 Doyles district was combined with the Pittsburgh-based district of fellow Democrat William J. Coyne. The state legislature allegedly reconfigured the district map in order to elect more Republicans from the state. In the process, they drew most of western Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic areas into just two districtsthe reconfigured 14th District and the 12th District of John Murtha. The potentially explosive situation of having two Democratic incumbents face each other in the primary was defused when Coyne announced his retirement (even though the district contained more of Coyne's former territory than Doyle's) leaving Doyle as the sole incumbent. The new district is by far the most Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, and Doyle was completely unopposed in 2002 and 2004; in 2006 and 2008, his only opposition was Green Party candidate Titus North.[22][23]
Doyle was challenged by Republican Melissa Haluszczak and Green Party Ed Bortz.
Doyle faced Republican nominee Hans Lessmann in the general election.
Doyle ran unopposed in 2014.[24] As of October 15, 2014, Doyle had raised $747,107 during the 2013-2014 campaign cycle.[25]"

He previously worked as a development officer for Lehigh University, an industrial electronics salesman, a hotel clerk, and an aide to U.S. Representative Donald L. Ritter.
Before being elected to the United States Congress, Dent was a member of the State Legislature for 14 years. He represented Pennsylvania's 132nd house district from 1991 to 1999 after unseating Democratic incumbent Jack Pressman in a heavily Democratic district in 1990. In 1998, Dent won an open 16th District Senate seat when Democrat Roy Afflerbach (who later served as Mayor of Allentown from 2002 to 2006) retired to take up an ultimately unsuccessful bid for Congress.
Dent was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004, succeeding Pat Toomey, who gave up his seat to challenge Arlen Specter for the U.S. Senate. He defeated Democrat Joe Driscoll 59%-39%.
He won re-election 54%-44% against Charles Dertinger.
He won re-election 59%-41% against Allentown Democratic Party Chairman Sam Bennett.
Dent won a re-election against Bethlehem Mayor John Callahan with 54% of the vote,[2] the smallest percent of the vote he received in his four elections.[3]
Dent defeated Democrat Rick Daugherty, the Chairman of the Lehigh County Democratic Party, 57%-43%.[4]
Dent is a proponent of hydrogen fuel and is one of the four founding members of the House Hydrogen Fuel Cell Caucus. In 2006 he proposed legislation aimed at promoting the rollout of commercial hydrogen fueling stations. Dent envisions the development of a ""Hydrogen Highway East,"" similar to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's plans for a Hydrogen Highway on the West Coast.
Dent is a member of The Republican Main Street Partnership. In 2007 he was elected to co-chair the Republican ""The Tuesday Group,"" a centrist organization of Congressional Republicans.
As a Republican representing a district with Democratic leanings, he sometimes crosses party lines on legislation. In December 2010, Dent was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" ban on openly gay service members.[5][6]
Dent is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[7]
He voted against Federal intervention in the Terri Schiavo case. Dent replied afterwards that he opposed government intervention in a personal matter and would have voted the same way had courts sided with Schiavo's parents.
In April 2010, Dent introduced a resolution urging the U.S. State Department to issue a Certificate of Loss of Nationality to Anwar al-Awlaki. He said al-Awlaki ""preaches a culture of hate"" and had been a functioning member of al-Qaeda ""since before 9/11"", and had effectively renounced his citizenship by engaging in treasonous acts.[8]
In April 2011, Dent voted in favor of a 2012 budget proposal authored by Paul Ryan entitled The Path to Prosperity, which included several controversial changes to both health care and tax policy. Dent said of the bill that, ""It's a serious, sober document...There are some things in there that I think are interesting.""[9]
In January 2012, Dent co-sponsored the Enemy Expatriation Act with Senator Joe Lieberman. The proposal would allow the United States government to strip U.S. citizens of their citizenship without requiring that the citizen have been convicted of a crime.[10]
At the start of the 112th Congress, Dent received a new position on the coveted House Appropriations Committee, and continues to serve on the House Ethics Committee.
In June 2013, Dent decided to co-sponsor the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA), a bill that would require schools and districts to adopt policies specifically prohibiting bullying and harassment against all students, including LGBT young people. Dent is known for his efforts to promote LGBT equality throughout the nation.[11]
In 2014, Dent introduced a bill to give states more flexibility in how they provide health insurance to children from families between 100 and 133 of the federal poverty level, according to Ripon Advance.[12]
Dent is married to Pamela Dent and has three children.

""Joe"" Pitts (born October 10, 1939) is the United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district, serving since 1997. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Lancaster and Reading and includes much of Amish country. It also includes the far southwestern suburbs of Philadelphia in Chester County.


Pitts was born in Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Asbury College. Pitts served five and a half years in the United States Air Force, with three tours in Vietnam. Initially commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, he was promoted to Captain by the time he left the service. He graduated second in his class from Navigator School, after which he was trained as an Electronic Warfare officer. As an EW officer, he served on B-52 Stratofortresss out of Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, with payloads of nuclear bombs. In all, he completed 116 combat missions in the Vietnam War and earned an Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters.
After leaving the Air Force in 1969, Pitts moved to Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia and the hometown of his wife, Ginny. They built a house there, where they still live today.
Pitts was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1972, representing Kennett Square and surrounding areas of Chester County.
After 10-term Republican congressman Bob Walker decided to retire in 1996, Pitts decided to run. He won the five-candidate Republican primary field with 45% of the vote, defeating the second place candidate by 19 percentage points.[1] In the general election, he defeated Democrat James G. Blaine 59%-38%.[2]
He won re-election easily in 1998 (71%), 2000 (67%), 2002 (88%), and 2004 (64%).
Pitts originally promised to serve only 10 years (five terms), but announced he would run again in 2006 amid considerable controversy. Despite the controversy, Pitts' won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Democrat businesswoman Lois Herr 57%-40%. The seventeen-point margin was the second smallest margin in his career.[3]
In 2008, Pitts decided to seek a seventh term. He was challenged by Navy veteran and construction contractor Bruce Slater. Pitts defeated him 56%-39%. The sixteen-point margin was the smallest margin in his career.[4]
Pitts was challenged by Democrat Lois Herr for a third rematch. He won re-election to an 8th term, defeating her 65%-35%.[5]
Pitts was challenged by Democrat businesswoman Aryanna Strader[6] and Independent Jim Bednarski[7] In the general election, Pitts won re-election to a ninth term, defeating Strader 55%-39%. The sixteen-point margin is tied for 2008 in being the smallest margin in his career. He lost in Berks County by 12,000 votes (35%) and won Chester County by only 500 votes (1%). He won Lancaster handily with over 60% of the vote.[8][9]
Pitts has a very conservative voting record, which is not surprising given that his district has historically been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+8. He received 100% ratings from the American Conservative Union in 2005 and the Christian Coalition of America in 2004.
In 2002 Pitts was angered[weaselwords] after a federal judge ordered the removal of the Ten Commandments from the Chester County courthouse, releasing a press statement that said, ""I think that religion and the Ten Commandments in particular should have a role in our public life"" and supported The Ten Commandments Defense Act (H.R. 2045). Since his first term Pitts has been chairman of the Values Action Team, a subgroup of the Republican Study Committee that coordinates legislation with the Christian right.[10]
Over the years Pitts has received 100% ratings from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 0% ratings from Public Citizens Congress Watch. In 2008 the ACLU gave him an 18% rating, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0%, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights gave him a score of 4%. In 2007-08 the John Birch Society gave him a score of 67%, and the American Conservative Union gave him a 100% rating, as did the Christian Coalition. Others: American Association of University Women, 2007-8, 16%; Republicans for Environmental Protection, 7% in 2007; and the Children's Health Fund, 2007-8, 0%; National Rifle Association, 2008, A; Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 2003, 0%; National Breast Cancer Coalition, 2007-8, 0%; Children's Health Fund 2007-8, 0%. Ratings from labor groups are consistently at or near 0%; the Alliance for Worker Freedom, 2008, 100%.[11]
Pitts visited Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban and Pakistan in 2002. He visited Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel in 2008 as part of a Congressional Delegation.[12] He is a leading congressional advocate of nuclear power, and ""introduced a bill in 2009 to fast-track the regulatory process for approving new reactors, he called it the 'Streamline America's Future Energy (SAFE) Nuclear Act.'""[13]
Pitts is an advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Bob Goodlatte-Jim Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[14] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[15]
The StupakPitts Amendment is an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 written by Pitts and Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan, and it inserted abortion into the national health overhaul debate. This amendment continues his longtime opposition to abortion. According to Jeff Sharlet, a contributing editor for Harper's, Pitts is a documented member of the Bible-oriented Christian group ""The Fellowship (Christian organization)"" and the C Street group in Washington, D.C.
In the 112th Congress, Pitts introduced the Protect Life Act, which would place additional restrictions on abortion access.
In July 2011, Pitts was revealed, in course of an FBI investigation, to have accepted tainted funds traced to the intelligence services of Pakistan.[16] These funds were routed through the so-called Kashmiri American Council (KAC), run by Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, who was convicted of several felonies by the Federal government. Pitts later donated these funds to charity.[citation needed]
On March 26, 2014, Pitts introduced the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would delay until March 2015 the pending cut to Medicare, a cut that has been regularly delayed for over a decade.[17][18] The bill would not offset this spending with increased revenue or cuts to spending in other places, a source of controversy.[18][19] Pitts said he still supports a permanent fix to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and is ""sponsoring this bill today because it is my earnest hope that this is the last patch we will have to pass.""[19]
On May 29, 2014, Pitts introduced into the House the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (H.R. 4771; 113th Congress), a bill that would expand the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and would establish new crimes relating to false labeling of steroids.[20] This type of steroid enhances muscles.[21] The bill would establish a penalty of up to $500,000 against those found to be falsely labeling their anabolic steroid products.[21]
Joe and his wife Ginny have three children as well as four grandchildren.[25]

The district includes a large swath of northeastern Pennsylvania, including Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Easton. A member of the Democratic Party, Cartwright defeated 10-term incumbent Blue Dog Tim Holden, the Dean of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation, in the Democratic primary on April 24, 2012, by a 57%-43% margin. Cartwright went on to defeat Republican Laureen Cummings in the general election on November 6, 2012 by a 61%-39% margin.[2] As an attorney, Cartwright previously worked at the law firm of Munley, Munley, and Cartwright.


Cartwright was born on May 1, 1961 in Erie, Pennsylvania, the son of Alton S. Cartwright and Adelaide Cartwright. Matt Cartwright attended Upper Canada College (Toronto), graduating in 1979, before going to on to earn a magna cum laude Bachelor of Arts Degree in History at Hamilton College in 1983,[3] where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Cartwright studied law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He served two years as an Editor of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review and received his Juris Doctor degree in 1986.[4] In 1981, Cartwright attended the London School of Economics.[5] It is at that school where Cartwright met his future wife, Marion Munley. Munley and Cartwright joined the Munley family's law firm in the Scranton area.[citation needed]
For twenty-five years, Cartwright worked as an attorney and partner at Munley, Munley and Cartwright, a Scranton firm specializing in representation of consumers and small businesses in personal and business litigation.[6] He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1986 and in 2005 was further admitted to the Bar of New York. In 2008, Cartwright was inducted into the International Society of Barristers.[7]
Cartwright served from 2009 to 2012 as a member of the Board of Governors of the American Association for Justice.[8] Between 2005 and 2011, Cartwright was the on-air legal analyst for The Law & You. In the segment, aired nightly as part of NBC affiliate WBRE-TV's evening newscast, he fielded viewer questions on legal matters.[9] In 2011, Cartwright co-authored the legal treatise Litigating Commercial and Business Tort Cases published by Thomson Reuters.[10]
During the 1992 presidential election, Cartwright was an Elected Delegate for candidate Bill Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, representing Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district.[11][12] In 2001-2002, he served as District Governor for Rotary International District 7410, covering northeastern Pennsylvania.[13] On November 5, 2010, the Boy Scouts of America's Northeastern Pennsylvania Council presented Cartwright with its Silver Beaver Award for volunteer service to that organization.[14]
Pennsylvania Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process after the 2010 United States Census, significantly altered Holden's 17th district. The old 17th had been based in Harrisburg, but the new 17th had been pushed well to the north and east. In the process, it absorbed heavily Democratic Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, previously in the 11th District.[15] Had the district existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried it with 56 percent of the vote; by comparison John McCain carried the old 17th with 51 percent of the vote.
It was widely believed that Holden, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, would face a tough fight to secure re-election in the primary. Not only was the district significantly bluer than its predecessor, but it was located in territory that he did not know and did not know him. The only portion of the district that had been in the old 17th was Holden's home in Schuylkill County, with the majority of Democratic primary voters located in counties considered more favorable to Cartwright's candidacy.[16][17] During the primary, Cartwright described himself as being from ""the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party""  a line often employed by Howard Dean and Paul Wellstone.[18] He was supported by MoveOn.org, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Campaign for Primary Accountability.[19][20] Cartwright ran as a self-professed ""FDR Democrat"", and as an ally of President Obama on taxes and health care reform, and pledged to work with U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., also of Scranton, on regulations for safety in fracking. Cartwright also benefited in the race from endorsements from popular local public figures like State Representative Phyllis Mundy and former Scranton mayor Jimmy Connors.
Holden's opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and his support of energy legislation that included the Halliburton loophole are believed to have contributed to his defeat.[21]
On April 24, 2012, Cartwright defeated Holden by 57%-43% in the primary.[22]
In the November general election, Cartwright faced Republican nurse Laureen Cummings, a leader of the Scranton Tea Party. On November 6, Cartwright defeated Cummings, 61%39% to become the district's next congressman.[23]
On January 4, 2013, Cartwright was selected by his peers to serve as a class president of the 49 new Democratic members of the 113th Congress.[24][25]
On March 28, 2014, Cartwright was named a ""moderate Democratic leader"" in the U.S. House by the independent legislative watchdog GovTrack.us.[26]
Cartwright supports reducing defense spending.[27] He also has described education as the only method of truly alleviating poverty.[27] He supports stricter enforcement of prohibitions against gender based discrimination in wages.[27]
Cartwright describes himself as pro-life.[27]
He supports same-sex marriages[27] and stated ""there's no reason to discriminate against gay people.""[28] He does not believe religious leaders should be mandated to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.[28]
To combat global warming, Cartwright supports implementing cap-and-trade emission standards for companies to encourage lowering emissions.[27] Although he believes American energy production and American economic growth are linked, he does not believe environment-friendly methods should be ruled out.[29] He supports investments in sustainable ""green"" energy productions with fewer emissions.[29] He also supports further forest conservation and is committed to keep water sources clean through repealing legislation allowing companies to pollute water supplies.[29]
On February 26, 2014, Cartwright introduced the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 (H.R. 4092; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools.[30][31] Cartwright argued that ""the bill is a strategic and cost-saving investment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by schools across the country while bringing us closer to energy security."" Cartwright's bill passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on April 30, 2014.[32] It passed the full House of Representatives on June 23, 2014.[33]
Cartwright is in favor of more gun control.[27] During his first month in office he co-sponsored four bills involving gun control.[34] He opposes gun-makers' legal immunity after a crime has occurred, as does he oppose assault rifle sales.[34]
Cartwright supports increasing the income tax.[27] He also believes the current tax system in place gives too many breaks to Americans in the highest tax brackets.[27] He describes the middle class as being ""under assault"" and seeks to alter the tax system to allow the middle-class to carry less of a burden.[27]
Cartwright married Marion Munley in 1985.[35] They live in Moosic, Pennsylvania with their two sons.[1]"

Murphy (born September 11, 1952) is the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, serving since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Pennsylvania Senate.
The district includes several suburbs south of Pittsburgh. It includes parts of Allegheny, Washington, Beaver and Westmoreland counties. He won re-election in 2014 unopposed.[2]


Murphy was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Walsh Jesuit High School, and received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh.
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy is co-author of The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV, a program of C-SPAN. ""Overcoming Passive-Aggression"" received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[4] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN, CBS Face the Nation, C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%-30%.[5] In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%-45%.[6] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%-36%.[7]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of ""Smartest Legislators.""[8] He resigned his senate seat on January 3, 2003.
After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoodsand even streetswere split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.[9]
Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%-37%.[10]
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[11] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%-42%.[12]
Murphy was challenged Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%-36%.[13][14]
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[15] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[16] Murphy won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Connolly 67%-33%.[17]
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28 year old political novice and ""Tea Party"" favorite,[18] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[19][20][21] Murphy won the primary 63%-33%.[22][23] In the general election, he won re-election to his seventh term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%-36%.[24][25]
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[2][26]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as ""R-Pittsburgh"", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad. After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S.Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[27][28]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as ""Cap and Trade.""[29]
Murphy was named a ""Hero of the Taxpayer"" by Americans for Tax Reform.[30] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[31] Prior to that, he approved the ""short term"" debt limit increase.[32]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory, yet requested millions nearly $14 million in earmarks in 2010 with over 60% going directly to campaign contributors.[33] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress entitled ""Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)"".[34] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses,[35] together with various exhibits which CREW asserted supports their naming him to their list of the most corrupt members of Congress.[36]
Murphy was the Republican sponsor of the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348-79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[37] Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace. He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[38] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[38]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[39][40]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[41] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[42]
Murphy previously served on the Veterans Affairs and Government Reform committees.[43][44]

Georgetown University Law Center","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cicilline","David Cicilline","Democratic","Mayor of Providence","Roman Catholic","David Nicola Cicilline (/sslini/; born July 15, 1961) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Rhode Island's 1st congressional district since 2011.[2] He is a member of the Democratic Party. He previously served as Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 2003 to 2011, and was the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.[3][4]


Cicilline was born July 15, 1961, in Providence, Rhode Island. His mother, Sabra (ne Peskin), is Jewish, and his father, John Francis ""Jack"" Cicilline, is Italian American and Catholic.[5][6][7] His father is a prominent attorney in Providence who defended local Mafia figures in the 1970s and 1980s and was an aide to Mayor Joseph A. Doorley.[5]
He was raised in Providence before moving to Narragansett. In high school, he served as president of his graduating class and participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program before heading to Brown University, where he established a branch of the College Democrats with his classmate, John F. Kennedy, Jr. He took a degree in political science, graduating magna cum laude in 1983. He then went to Georgetown University Law Center where he earned a J.D.
He remained in Washington, D.C., for a while to work as a lawyer and Public Defender Service.
He ran for the Rhode Island Senate in 1992 against incumbent senator Rhoda Perry but lost the Democratic primary. Two years later, he was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing the 4th district on Providence's East Side. He won the Democratic primary to succeed retiring Rep. Linda J. Kushner with 56% of the vote and was unopposed in the general election.[8]
According to his website, he ""earned a reputation as a fierce champion of political reform and gun safety, and his dedication to ethics won him Common Causes top ranking.""[9]
Cicilline was elected in a landslide in November 2002 with 84% of the vote, following the downfall of controversial mayor Vincent Cianci and the aftermath of Operation Plunder Dome.[10] He succeeded acting mayor John J. Lombardi, who served out Cianci's term and decided not to run in the following election.[11] In 2006, Cicilline won an easy re-election with 83 percent of the vote.[12] A Brown University survey in September 2007 found that 64 percent of state residents approved of the job Cicilline was doing in Providence. By February 2008, that number had dropped to 51 percent. And in September 2008, his popularity fell to 46 percent.[13]
Providence has experienced a significant drop in crime, attributed by some to community policing. As of 2007, Providence saw its lowest crime rate in 30 years, contrary to national trends. The city has eliminated 14 percent of management positions, dropped to 17th in the state for per-capita tax and received an ""A"" bond rating from all three major bond-rating agencies.[12]
Cicilline was 2008 President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors. As mayor, he was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,[14] a bi-partisan group with the stated goal of ""making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets."" The Coalition was co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In 2009 Cicilline served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[15]
Cicilline's administration focused on the residential neighborhoods of Providence, as well as the ""Renaissance"" areas of downtown and Federal Hill that thrived under Cianci, and continued the promotion of the city via the tax breaks given to artists and movie productions. A former state legislator, he overcame the animosity between state and city government that had existed under Cianci.
In May 2009, Cicilline gained national headlines after proposing a $150 per semester Head Tax on each of the 25,000 college students attending four universities in the city. The tax was an effort to close $6 to $8 million of a reported $17 million city budget shortfall. The Associated Press reported that if enacted, it would become the first-in-the-nation tax on students simply for being enrolled and attending college within the city limits.[16]
Cicilline has expressed concern about the Providence metropolitan area's carbon footprint. As mayor, he sought to implement a streetcar/light rail-type system for the city. He also focused efforts to fight poverty. He won passage of a vacant-and-abandoned property penalty, to provide an economic disincentive for banks to keep properties off the housing market for extended periods of time. He also proposed municipal bonds for the purpose of buying foreclosed properties to expand housing.[17]
Cicilline is a strong proponent of after-school activities as a means of improving opportunities for children.[18] As mayor, Cicilline served as Chair of the Standing Committee for Children, Health and Human Services of the United States Conference of Mayors.[19] He has also been recognized for his efforts to establish youth programming and to strengthen ties among schools, businesses and local government, in order to expand access to after-school programming. Under Cicilline, city officials worked with Rhode Islands Education Partnership to form PASA, the Providence After School Alliance.[18] Cicilline also serves on the board of the national nonprofit Afterschool Alliance, an organization that works to promote and to support after-school activities for all children.[20]
Between 1980 and 2009, most prostitution was legal in Rhode Island.[21] As mayor, Cicilline was a strong advocate for outlawing it.[22] Cicilline personally testified in Superior Court to stop the opening of ""spas"" in Providence, and discussed his position in the 2009 documentary Happy Endings?.[22][23] [24] He lobbied for a prostitution law not only to arrest sex workers and their customers, but also to fine landlords that permitted prostitution on their premises.[25] On September 2, 2009, Cicilline submitted an ordinance to the City Council to ban indoor prostitution in the city, imposing a $500 fine and a potential 30-day prison sentence on violators.[26] On November 3, 2009, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri signed into law a bill making the buying and selling of sexual services a crime.[21] (See also: Prostitution in Rhode Island)
During the 2008 Democratic primaries, Cicilline supported Hillary Clinton. In August 2008, he attended the Democratic National Convention in Denver. While there, he told an interviewer that he now supported Barack Obama, saying ""[t]here is a real sense of hope and optimism about what we're about to do and about a chance in leadership in this country"".[27]
On June 8, 2008, Marco Riz, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who had been arrested twice the previous year while under a deportation order, was charged with the robbery and rape of a 30-year-old woman.[28] A federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent criticized the Providence Police Department for not checking Riz's immigration status at the time of his previous arrest.[29] The governor of Rhode Island, Donald Carcieri, blamed Cicilline for the department's failure. Previously, Carcieri had signed an executive order requiring all state officials to work with ICE on arrests or hirings of illegal immigrants. When Carcieri asked the same of local agents, Providence Police Chief Dean Esserman refused. Cicilline responded that it has been the policy of the Police Department to work with ICE and its database on all arrests, that the policy had been followed when Riz was arrested, and that the ICE had failed to act.[29]
On July 8, 2008, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that Cicilline was not upholding his oath of office by failing to report illegal immigrants, suggesting the U.S. Attorney investigate the mayor.[30] Mayor Cicilline responded by accusing Carcieri of ""playing politics"", eight days later writing an op-ed in the Providence Journal stating that the city always has and will continue to report all arrests to immigration authorities, and that the focus is therefore inappropriate.[31] Carcieri was term-limited and prevented from running for a third term in 2010.
Beginning in 2003, Cicilline was engaged in a dispute with the Providence Firefighters labor union, Local 799. In a July 2002 email Cicilline sent to the members of Local 799, he indicated that he hoped to resolve their pending contract dispute with the city within 30 days of taking office. In August, Cicilline said in an interview that it was impossible for him to promise to bring the contract negotiations to a successful conclusion owing to the unpredictability of his negotiating partners.[32] The city and the union had been in arbitration in every contract year since 2002, with Cicilline appealing one arbitration decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The appeal was rejected.[33]
In 2004, Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards canceled a fundraising appearance in Providence in support of the Local 799.[34] In 2007, Hillary Clinton asked Cicilline, a Clinton supporter, not to attend a Clinton rally because of threats by the union to picket the appearance.[35][36]
Both the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) censured Cicilline for his conduct in this matter.[37][38] In 2009, due to the union picketline, the Obama administration canceled Joe Biden's appearance at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Providence in the interests of remaining neutral in the conflict.[39]
In June 2008, John M. Cicilline, brother of Mayor Cicilline, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements for his role in the courthouse corruption scheme. Federal prosecutors indicted John Cicilline, disbarred attorney Joseph Bevilacqua, Jr., and two assistants in January 2007. According to court documents, the two attorneys spun a complicated scheme to win leniency in a drug trafficking case.[40]
Before reporting to prison, John M. Cicilline gave the city of Providence a $75,000 check for taxes owed by a client, but asked that the check not be cashed and only held as collateral. Two of the mayors top aides told the city tax collector Robert Ceprano, not to cash the check because it would bounce. In four instances, Ceprano said mayoral aides pressured him to perform tax favors for the mayors friends and/or campaign contributors. The mayor claimed the taxpayers had been given relief because the city had made errors on their taxesnot because they were his friends or contributors. During the controversy, Ceprano was fired [41]
On May 10, 2009, Robert Ceprano filed a lawsuit against the City of Providence alleging conspiracy, corruption, libel and wrongful termination. The suit accuses John M. Cicilline, the mayors imprisoned brother, of attempting to defraud the City of Providence by writing a bad check for $75,000 on behalf of a delinquent taxpayer. Furthermore, it alleges, the mayor and his aides willfully conspired...to conceal John Cicillines illegal activities. Ceprano also charges that he was fired not for poor job performance, but because he resisted the mayors efforts to perform tax favors for political friends and supporters. Lawyers for Ceprano are asking for $10 million.[42] The single count complaint against John Cicilline was dismissed by Judge Kristin Rodgers on November 17, 2009.[43]
Shortly after assuming office, Cicilline's successor as the Mayor of the City of Providence, Angel Taveras, announced that the City was facing a ""category 5"" hurricane due to its substantial debt. Tavares was compelled to engage in austerity cuts including teacher layoffs and paycuts for city employees.[44] The total structural debt inherited by Tavares in 2011 was $180 million.[45]
A report commissioned by the City of Providence found that the Cicilline administration had transferred funds from the Undesignated Surplus (the city's cash reserves) without the proper approval of the City Council, had not provided financial information on a timely basis to the independent auditor, the City Council or the Internal Auditor, and had not provided the City Council with monthly financial statements or with projections of year-end surpluses or deficits, among other findings.[46] Providence City Council Finance Chairman John Igliozzi accused him of ""hiding the scope of the citys fiscal woes through 'illusory revenues, borrowing and other tricks.'""[47]
Fitch Ratings also downgraded Providence's ratings, citing ""imprudent budgeting decisions and failure to implement recurring budget solutions"". Ciciline, who portrayed himself as a reformer looking to restore transparency to city hall, was criticized by his opponents from the primary and House elections: Democrat Anthony Gemma said that he felt Cicilline had lied his way to federal office and Republican John Loughlin said You just dont lie to people in such a transparent way.""[47]
A year later, it was reported that Providence could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Former Mayor Vincent Cianci put much blame on Cicilline for Providence's problems, saying that although he didn't think it was entirely his fault, he did hide it from the public. Experts have said that the only way out for Providence may be to declare bankruptcy.[48][49]
On February 13, 2010, Cicilline announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives following the retirement of Patrick J. Kennedy. He won the Democratic primary in September with 37% of the vote: defeating businessman Anthony Gemma (23%), State Representative David Segal (20%), and state party chairman Bill Lynch (20%).[50][51]
In November, he defeated Republican State Representative John Loughlin with 51% of the vote.[2][52]
He ran for re-election in the newly redrawn 1st district, and won.[53]
A February 2012 survey showed Cicilline's approval rating had dropped almost 10% in 3 months, with the percent rating his performance ""excellent or good"" dropping by 24%. Anthony Gemma, Cicilline's primary opponent, said that the poll clearly showed that ""a majority of Rhode Islanders wanted to see Cicilline go.""[54]
In 2011 it was reported that although Rhode Island had experienced a population shift of only 7,200, a new congressional map would put 125,000 Rhode Islanders into new districts, which would help Democrats, and notably Cicilline.[55] Fellow House Democrat Jim Langevin accused Cicilline of trying to use the redistricting to aid with his reelection campaign. Possible Republican contenders suggested that it was an attempt to save Cicilline after his approval numbers had dropped. Cicilline commented, saying that he did not attempt to influence the redistricting.[56]
He is running for re-election to a third term in office
Upon being sworn in, Cicilline became the fourth openly gay member of Congress.[57]
Cicilline says that his biggest priority in Congress is helping the creation of good-paying jobs in Rhode Island. He also has indicated his support for small businesses, seniors, Medicare, and for bringing the troops home.[58]
Cicilline has voted with his party 96% of the time.[59] He has been described as a populist-leaning liberal.[60]
An avid supporter of non-violence, Cicilline has taken a stance against the U.S. military presence in Libya, voting to limit the use of funds supporting NATO operations in Libya and to remove armed forces from Libya.[61] On a domestic level, he is a strong anti-gun advocate. (He was a founding member of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns.)[62] In 2010, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Cicilline; in 2000, the National Rifle Association awarded him an F- lifetime score.[63] Cicilline has also indicated his support for a ban on the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons, for more stringent state restrictions on the purchase and possession of firearms, and for a requirement that manufacturers equip firearms with child-safety locks.[64] On November 16, 2011, Cicilline made a powerful public statement against the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act which would require all states to allow out-of-state visitors to carry concealed firearms as long as the laws of the visitors' home states allow them to do so.[65] He insisted that the Second Amendment had nothing to do with this bill, which, he said, would infringe upon the right of state governments to protect the safety of their citizens, and would force communities to accept concealed-carry standards set by other states.[66]
Cicilline is pro-choice, and advocates that abortions should always be legally available and that government funding should be provided to clinics and medical facilities that provide abortion services.[64] He opposed the Protect Life Act of October 2011, which would ban the use of federal funds to cover any costs under health care plans that pay for abortions and would allow federally funded hospitals to refuse to perform the abortions (even in cases in which the mother's life is in danger).[67] Stating that the bill would put women's lives at risk and would limit how women can spend their own private dollars to purchase health insurance, Cicilline declared it outrageous.[68] He also voted in February 2011 against prohibiting the disbursement of federal funds to Planned Parenthood and, in May 2011, against prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion.[61] Cicilline has also cosponsored the Violence Against Women Health Initiative Act of 2011 to improve the health care system's assessment and response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and for other purposes.[69]
Cicilline has declared his support for veterans' access to a range of resources in health care, housing, employment, mental health services, and education. [70] He has cosponsored the Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act to aid veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder,[71] the Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act to permit disabled veterans to receive both retirement pay and disability compensation,[72] and the Veteran Employment Transition Act of 2011 to extend work opportunities to recently discharged veterans.[73] On November 18, 2011, Cicilline said the following about the Vow Hire Heroes Act, which increases job opportunities for veterans: ""This vote ensures that Rhode Island veterans and all of our nation's veterans will receive some of the tools and resources they need to successfully reenter the workforce and provide for their families and loved ones.[74]"

Langevin was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended Bishop Hendricken High School, located in Warwick, Rhode Island, and then went on to study at Rhode Island College, from which he received an undergraduate degree, in addition to serving as President of Student Community Government, Inc., and he has a Masters of Public Administration from the Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University.[1]
In 1980, at age 16, he was seriously injured in an accidental shooting. He had been working as a volunteer at the Warwick Police Department when a weapon accidentally discharged, leaving him a quadriplegic.
Langevin's first experience in politics was when he was elected to the state's 1986 constitutional convention and was named its secretary. Langevin, who uses a wheelchair, once ran on the slogan ""I'll stand up for you"", which he stated during a meeting in West Warwick.
Langevin was first elected a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1988 and served as a state representative until 1994. He was elected Secretary of State of Rhode Island in November 1994, defeating Republican incumbent Barbara Leonard. While Secretary of State, he earned a reputation for weeding out corruption in state government.
Langevin has a mixed record on abortion. He has voted both to restrict and defend the choice to have the procedure. He voted against banning abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act, however he has voted for the Abortion Pain Bill, which seeks to ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child.""[2] However, he strongly promotes contraceptive availability, and in a statement in 2007 said, I have great respect for the passion displayed by Mr. Smith and Mr. Stupak and I share their opposition to abortion. However, in this instance I must strongly disagree with their decision to prevent the distribution of contraception to some of the most poor and needy people and nations in the world.[3] Because of his mixed stance on the issue, he has received fluctuating ratings from interest groups such as Planned Parenthood and the National Right to Life Committee.[4]
Langevin believes that abortion should be legal when the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape or when the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, but does wish to decrease the number of abortions in the country.[5] His relatively complex stance on abortion contributes to somewhat contradictory interest group ratings because of his supporting of various bills: Representative Langevins stance on abortion supported the interests of the NARAL Pro-Choice America 0 percent in 2006 but in 2007, the same group gave Representative Langevin a grade of 100 and the National Right to Life Committee gave the Representative zero points, with points assigned for actions connected to a pro-life anti-abortion agenda.[6]
On the issue of Health Care, Langevin has strongly demonstrated his support of reform. In May 2009, he introduced the American Health Benefits Program Act of 2009, which has the stated purpose of ""amending the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to assure comprehensive, affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans through an American Health Benefits Program.[7] He has voted in favor of health care extensively during his time in office.[8] In addition, he receives much of his campaign donations from health professionals.[9] Langevin stated his goal for universal health care as a system of portable and continuous coverage based on quality, affordability and choice that promotes investment in long-term prevention and drives down the cost of care over time.[10]
Langevin is considered strongly pro-labor. He has received $130,000 in campaign contributions from pro-labor groups.[11] During his time in office, he has supported labor interests in over 25 votes.[12] Numerous labor interest groups have rated him extremely highly, including the United Auto Workers, the AFL-CIO, and the Utility Workers Union of America.[13] Interestingly, however, the Latin America Working Group and The Alliance for Worker Freedom have ranked Langevin very poorly.[13]
He supports gun control, and co-sponsored a 2005 bill which would have reauthorized the 1994 assault weapons ban, which had expired in 2004.
One of Langevins top priorities as a Member of Congress has been the expansion of federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[14] His policy position is driven by his paralysis and the possibilities that stem cell research provide in helping this condition; he joined other members of the House in introducing the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, expanding the limited funding put in place in 2001.[14]
Langevin helped to found the House Cybersecurity Caucus, which he co-chairs.[15] The Representative has appeared on 60 Minutes speaking about the national security challenges the country will face this century in regards to protecting infrastructure and data.[16] Langevin has said that he hopes to raise awareness of the need for security in that area and supports strict penalties for internet crimes as well as strong internet privacy laws.[5]
Rep. Langevin supports cybersecurity measures as long as they do not add ""unnecessary regulations to business"".[17] His state of Rhode Island passed a statewide cybersecurity plan which Langevin greatly supported in October 2012. In May of 2012, Langevin proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which would account for the cyber risks that United States faces in terms of national security, saying without these measures the United States is "" ignoring key aspects of what is fast becoming the biggest threat to our security""[18]
""Cybersecurity contractors General Dynamics and Raytheon were Langevin's two top sources for campaign contributions"" in the 2010 election.[15]
Langevin, who serves on the Committee of Armed Services, has regularly voted for additional support of armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but he has voted for a timeline for U.S. forces to leave Iraq as well as a ban on any permanent U.S. bases in the country.[19] Langevin has also voted against limiting the interrogation techniques used in fighting terror and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.[20]
Langevin, who serves on the Congressional Committee on the Budget, believes in tax-cuts for low-income and middle class citizens while eliminating the tax cuts made for the wealthy, indicating in his Political Courage Test that he wishes to greatly decrease taxes for families making less than $75,000.[5] Langevin also supports temporary incentives for businesses to invest in job creation. Representative Langevin, with a 100% rating from the AFL-CIO, is pro-labor and supports the regulation of business.[6]
Langevin is known as an advocate for people with disabilities and for universal health care, being himself a quadriplegic. He is the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress.[21]
On July 27, 2004, he spoke to the Democratic National Convention, largely on the subject of stem cell research.
In March 2007, Langevin became a co-sponsor of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which had the stated purpose of ""enhancing and furthering research into paralysis and to improve rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities."" The bill passed the House of Representatives but not the Senate. However, in 2009, the bill was included in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, also co-sponsored by Langevin, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama.
For the Presidency in 2008, Langevin announced his support for Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY),[22] by serving as a special adviser on issues ranging from stem cell research to people with disabilities.
On July 26th, 2010, Langevin became the first member of Congress to preside over the House of Representatives while using a wheelchair.[21] The House had just recently installed a wheelchair lift leading up to the Speakers rostrum.[21]
Representative Langevin leans to the left on environmental and energy issues in Congress. Environmental issue groups have generally given him high ratings; more recently he received a 97% from the League of Conservation Voters in 2011. He has also received a rating of 100% from the Defenders of Wildlife Foundation. Conservative issue groups concerning the energy and the environment have given him very low ratings. He is a strong supporter of alternative energy from oil and coal, voting 'Nay' for the Stop the War Against Coal Act of September 2012[23] and he has supported measures for new wind farms in New England. He has praised these developments, saying wind farm ""development holds great promise for Rhode Island and the country to have more stable and cleaner energy resources, while boosting our economy by presenting an opportunity to build a manufacturing base for these turbines and create quality jobs in the Ocean State.""[24][25]
In 2011, Langevin strongly opposed the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would limit the EPA's ability to regulate carbon outputs. Calling the act the ""Dirty Air Act,"" Langevin explained that in passing this act America would be ""turning back the progress we have made to protect our health under the Clean Air Act,"" also claiming that the passage of the bill would be ""continuing our nation's addiction to foreign oil.""[26] Moreover, he has fought for more environmental regulations that he believes will help Rhode Islanders live healthier lives, saying that ""protecting the environment is a matter of pride.""[27]
Langevin was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2000, defeating perennial candidate Robert Tingle for a seat that was left open when Congressman Robert Weygand ran for the U.S. Senate. He took office in 2001, representing Rhode Island's 2nd congressional district. He has been re-elected with relative ease ever since, defeating independent Rodney Driver in 2006 and Republican Mark Zaccaria in 2008.
In 2010, he again defeated Republican nominee Mark Zaccaria.
Langevin ran for reelection in the 2nd District.[28] He was challenged by Republican nominee Michael Riley and Independent Abel Collins, an environmental activist.[29] Langevin was re-elected with 55.7% of the vote.[30]"

University of Virginia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanford","Mark Sanford","Republican","U.S. House (1995-2001), Governor of South Carolina","Episcopalian","Marshall Clement ""Mark"" Sanford, Jr. (born May 28, 1960) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party. He currently serves as the U.S. Representative for South Carolina's 1st congressional district after winning a special election on May 7, 2013.[2][3] He previously represented the same district from 1995 to 2001, before being elected Governor of South Carolina, a position he held from 2003 to 2011.
First elected to Congress in 1994, Sanford pledged to serve no more than three terms and did not seek re-election in 2000. He left office in 2001 and was elected as the 115th Governor of South Carolina in 2002, defeating Democratic incumbent Jim Hodges, and was re-elected in 2006. As Governor, Sanford had a contentious relationship with the South Carolina legislature: notably, he made public statements that he would reject stimulus funds for his state from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Following a subsequent battle in the South Carolina Supreme Court, he was forced to accept the funds.
On June 24, 2009, Sanford resigned as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, after he publicly revealed that he had engaged in an affair with Mara Beln Chapur, an Argentine woman.[4][5][6][7] He was later censured by the South Carolina General Assembly following a State Ethics Commission investigation into allegations that he had misused state travel funds to conduct his affair.
Sanford is also a real estate developer and a former medical administration officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.[8][9][10]


Marshall Clement Sanford, Jr. was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His parents were Marshall Clement Sanford, Sr., a cardiologist, and his wife, the former Peggy Pitts. Despite his family being fairly well-to-do, his entire family slept in the same room to conserve electricity.[11] Before his senior year of high school, Sanford moved with his family from Fort Lauderdale to the 3,000-acre (1,200ha) Coosaw Plantation near Beaufort, South Carolina. Sanford attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.[12]
Sanford received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from Furman University in 1983 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia in 1988.[13] Shortly afterward, he moved to Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, an affluent suburban community off Charleston.
He founded Norton and Sanford Real Estate Investment, a leasing and brokerage company, in 1992, and still owns the company.[14]
In 1994, Sanford entered the Republican primary for the Charleston-based 1st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. The seat had come open after four-term Republican incumbent Arthur Ravenel declined to seek re-election in his ultimately unsuccessful run for Governor. Despite having never run for office before, Sanford finished second in a crowded primary behind Van Hipp, Jr, a former George H. W. Bush administration official and former Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Sanford defeated Van Hipp in the runoff and easily defeated State Representative Robert A. Barber, Jr. in the November general election, winning by 66.3% to 32.4%.
Sanford was unopposed by Democratic candidates in 1996 and 1998. In 1996, he beat Joseph Innella of the Natural Law Party by 96.36% to 3.55%. He beat Innella again in 1998, this time by 91% to 8.9%.
While in Congress, Sanford was recognized as its most fiscally conservative member by the Cato Institute. He was also recognized by Citizens Against Government Waste, as well as the National Tax Payers Union, for his efforts to rein in government spending and reduce the national deficit.[15] He garnered a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union,.[16]
Sanford was known for an independent streak. He was known for voting against bills that otherwise got unanimous support.[17] For example, he voted against a bill that preserved sites linked to the Underground Railroad.[18] He voted against pork barrel projects even when they benefited his own district; in 1997 he voted against a defense appropriations bill that included funds for Charleston's harbor. Seeing himself as a ""citizen-legislator,"" he did not run for reelection in 2000, in keeping with a promise to serve only three terms in the House.[17]
During his first tenure in Congress, Sanford sponsored 39 bills, including:[19]
In 2002, just before announcing he would run for governor, Sanford joined the Air Force Reserve. He entered the gubernatorial election of 2002; he first defeated Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler in the Republican primary and then defeated the Democratic incumbent, Jim Hodges, in the general election, by a margin of 53% to 47% to become the 115th Governor of South Carolina. In accordance with South Carolina law, Sanford was elected separately from the state's Republican lieutenant governor, Andre Bauer. Sanford and Bauer's wins gave the Republicans full control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction.
In 2003, after becoming governor, Sanford attended two weeks of training with the Air Force Reserve in Alabama with his unit, the 315th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron. While in training in 2003, Sanford did not transfer power to Bauer, saying he would be in regular contact with his office, and would transfer authority in writing only if he were called to active duty.[21]
Sanford sometimes had a contentious relationship with the South Carolina General Assembly, even though it was dominated by his party for his entire tenure. The Republican-led state House of Representatives overrode 105 of Sanford's 106 budget vetoes on May 26, 2004.[22] The following day, Sanford brought live pigs, who subsequently defecated on the House floor, into the House chamber as a visual protest against ""pork projects.""[23]
Sanford rejected the Assembly's entire budget on June 13, 2006. Had this veto stood, the state government would have shut down on July 1. He explained his veto as being the only way to get the cuts he desired, and that using the line item veto would have been inadequate as well as impossible. However, in a special session the following day, both houses dismissed Sanford's call for reform by overriding his veto-effectively restoring their original budget[24]
Sanford professed to be a firm supporter of limited government. Later in his tenure, he embarked on a plan to reform methods of funding the state's public education system, including measures such as school vouchers aimed at introducing more competition into the school system as a means of fostering improvement. The plan, known as ""Put Parents In Charge,"" proposed to provide around $2,500 per child to parents who chose to withdraw their children from the state's public school system and instead send them to independent schools. Sanford framed this plan as a necessary market-based reform.[citation needed]
In 2003, Sanford sought to reform the state's public college system. Sanford has criticized these schools as focusing too much on separately creating research institutions and not on educating the young adults of South Carolina. Sanford also suggested that they combine some programs as a means of curbing tuition increases. The schools did not respond positively to this suggestion, however, causing Sanford to remark that ""if any institution ultimately feels uncomfortable with our push toward coordination, they can exit the system and go private.""[25]
Sanford also indicated a desire to increase the powers of the executive branch. Under the South Carolina Constitution, the governor is somewhat weaker than many of his counterparts. For instance, many of his appointment powers are shared with the South Carolina General Assembly.
Sanford's first term included other controversies. A Time Magazine article in November 2005, critical of Sanford, said that some ""fear his thrift has brought the state's economy to a standstill.""[26]
According to Survey USA, Sanford's approval ratings ranged from 47% to 55% during 2006.[27] According to Survey USA, Sanford's approval ratings in South Carolina after his admission of infidelity (6-24-09) showed that ""60% think the Governor should resign. 34% feel he should remain in office.""[28]
His campaign for re-election in 2006 began by Sanford winning the June 13 Republican Primary over Oscar Lovelace, a family physician from Prosperity, with 65% of the vote to Lovelace's 35%. His Democratic competitor in the November elections was state senator Tommy Moore, whom Sanford beat by 55%45%.[29]
On election day, Sanford was not allowed to vote in his home precinct because he did not have his voter registration card. He was obliged to go to a voter registration office to get a new registration card. ""I hope everybody else out there is as determined to vote as I was today,"" he said. Sanford's driver's license had a Columbia address, but Sanford was trying to vote at his home precinct in Sullivan's Island.[30] According to WAGT in Augusta, Georgia (whose service area includes part of South Carolina) Sanford declared that it would be his last campaign.[31]
In dissent with the Republican Party of South Carolina, Sanford, an Episcopalian,[citation needed] opposed the faith-based license plates his state offers, marketed largely to the state's conservative evangelical citizens. After allowing the law to pass without his signature, he wrote ""It is my personal view that the largest proclamation of one's faith ought to be in how one lives his life.""[32]
After the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Sanford strongly opposed and publicly criticized before and after its passage by Congress and presidential signing, Sanford initially indicated he might not accept all of the funds allotted by the spending law to South Carolina.[33] He was criticized by many Democrats and some moderate Republicans both in his state and outside who noted South Carolina's 9.5% unemployment rate (one of the highest in the country) and complained that Sanford wasn't doing enough to improve economic conditions in his state which he was intentionally trying to worsen, which could be alleviated by the stimulus money.[34][35][36] Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican Governor of California, suggested that if Sanford or other governors rejected their portion of stimulus funds, he would be happy to take them instead.[37]
On March 11, 2009, Sanford became the first United States governor to formally reject a portion of the federal stimulus money earmarked by Congress for the state of South Carolina.[38] Sanford compromised to accept the federal money on condition that the state legislature provide matching funds to pay down the South Carolina state debt.[39]
Sanford persuaded state legislator Nikki Haley to run as his successor, and campaigned on her behalf.[40]
In its April 2010 report, Democratic-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington [41] named Sanford one of eleven worst governors in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Sanford's term as governor and his time in Congress.[42]
The libertarian Cato Institute ranked Sanford as the best governor in America in their 2010 fiscal policy report card, describing him as ""a staunch supporter of spending restraint and pro-growth tax reforms"".[43]
From June 18 until June 24, 2009, the whereabouts of Sanford were unknown to the public, as well as to his wife and the State Law Enforcement Division, which provides security for him, garnering nationwide news coverage. The absence of Governor Sanford was first reported by Jim Davenport of the Associated Press.[44][45] Lieutenant Governor Andr Bauer announced that he could not ""take lightly that his staff has not had communication with him for more than four days, and that no one, including his own family, knows his whereabouts.""[46]
Before his disappearance, Sanford told his staff that he would be hiking on the Appalachian Trail and while he was gone he did not answer 15 cell phone calls from his chief of staff Scott English; he also failed to call his family on Father's Day.[47]
Reporter Gina Smith intercepted Sanford arriving at HartsfieldJackson Atlanta International Airport on a flight from Argentina. Several hours later, after learning that incriminating evidence was being swiftly mobilized against him by the media, Sanford held a news conference, during which he admitted that he had been unfaithful to his wife.[48][49]
In emotional interviews with the Associated Press over two days, Sanford said he would die ""knowing that I had met my soul mate.""[50] Sanford also said that he ""crossed the lines"" with a handful of other women during 20 years of marriage, but not as far as he did with his mistress. ""There were a handful of instances wherein I crossed the lines I shouldn't have crossed as a married man, but never crossed the ultimate line,"" he said.[50]
On June 25, La Nacin, a Buenos Aires newspaper, identified the Argentine woman as Mara Beln Chapur, a 43-year-old divorced mother of two with a university degree in international relations who lives in the city of Buenos Aires.[51] The State earlier had published details of e-mails between Sanford and a woman only identified as ""Maria.""[52] Sanford met Chapur at a dance in Uruguay in 2001 and admitted there was a more intimate relationship with her starting in 2008.[53]
Sanford's wife had become aware of her husband's infidelities around five months before the scandal broke, and the two had sought marriage counseling.[49] She said that she had requested a trial separation about two weeks before his disappearance.[54]
Sanford told reporters that months before his affair became public he had sought counsel at a controversial religious organization called The Family, of which he became a member when he was a Representative in Washington, D.C. from 1995 to 2001.[55]
In September 2014, Sanford and his ex-wife agreed on mediation over an argument arising from their divorce in 2010 after his extramarital affair while serving as the state's governor. Sanford's former wife asked the judge to require the congressman to undergo a psychiatric exam and take parenting and anger management classes. Judge Daniel Martin Jr. said he instead ordered them to take the issues to mediation within 30 days, as requested by in a motion filed by congressman.[56]
His wife, Jenny Sanford, after telling Vogue magazine that her husband was having a midlife crisis, moved out of the South Carolina Governor's Mansion, with the couples four sons, returning to the family home on Sullivan's Island.[57][58] On December 11, 2009, she announced that she was filing for divorce, calling it a ""sad and painful process.""[59] The divorce was finalized in March 2010.[60] Interestingly, a stipulation within his divorce papers demanded that while on the Sanford family's Coosaw plantation, ""no airplanes will be flown at children"". The papers also noted that Sanford liked to ""unwind"" by digging holes on the property with his hydraulic excavator.[61]
Sanford posted lengthy remarks on his Facebook page on September 12, 2014, regarding his ex-wife's ""legal machinations surrounding the custody of their children"". His remarks on Facebook are longer than the total of all his 2014 speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives.[62]
Sanford resigned as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association,[63][64] and he was swiftly succeeded by Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.[65] In a June 29 email to members of his political action committee, Sanford said he had no intention of resigning as governor.[66]
After his affair was revealed in June 2009, Sanford first claimed, ""There's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness. To be very clear: no public money was ever used in connection with this.""[67] After a reporter used the Freedom of Information Act to seek records of what public funds were used to pay for Sanford's trip to Argentina,[68] Sanford eventually chose to reimburse taxpayers for expenses he had incurred one year earlier with his mistress in Argentina.[69] He said, ""I made a mistake while I was there in meeting with the woman who I was unfaithful to my wife with. That has raised some very legitimate concerns and questions, and as such I am going to reimburse the state for the full cost of the Argentina leg of this trip. On August 9, 2009, the AP reported that Sanford may have violated state law by other abusive use of state planes, including to fly to get a haircut.[70]
On August 25, state representatives Nathan Ballentine and Gary Simrill met with Sanford and warned him that the state legislature would impeach him if he did not resign. Ballentine, an ally of Sanford's, said afterward, ""I told him the writing is on the wall. ...he could put an end to it all, but if he doesn't, members of the House will take things into their hands."" Sanford still declined to resign.[71] On August 28, The Washington Times reported that Republican lawmakers in South Carolina were ""laying plans"" for a special legislative session on whether to impeach Sanford. Two bills of impeachment were being prepared, with bipartisan support in the state legislature.[72]
On October 23, 2009, two impeachment resolutions were introduced, but were blocked by Democrats in the South Carolina legislature.[73] A month later, the resolution was successfully introduced and it was announced that an ad hoc committee would begin drafting articles of impeachment starting on November 24.[74] Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission formally charged Sanford with 37 violations.[75] making his removal or resignation all that more likely.
On December 3, during its third public hearing on the matter, the ad hoc committee unanimously voted to remove the vast majority of charges from the investigation, stating that they didn't warrant ""overturning an election."" On December 9, the committee voted 61 against impeachment, stating that the legislature had better things to do. However, the committee voted unanimously to censure the governor.[76] On the 16th the full House Judiciary Committee voted 156 to formally end the process.[77]
On December 15, 2009, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to censure Sanford. The full South Carolina House of Representatives voted 10211 on the resolution in January 2010.[78][79]
In 2006, before the midterm elections, some commentators discussed the possibility of Sanford running for president.[citation needed] He said that he would not run, and claimed that his re-election bid would be his last election, win or lose. After Super Tuesday in 2008, Sanford received some mention as a potential running mate for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, John McCain.[80][81][82]
Sanford publicly aligned himself with McCain in a March 15, 2008, piece in the Wall Street Journal. Likening the presidential race to a football game at halftime, Sanford noted that he ""sat out the first half, not endorsing a candidate...But I'm now stepping onto the field and going to work to help John McCain. It's important that conservatives do the same.""[83]
On January 11, 2008, shortly before the South Carolina presidential primaries (R Jan 19, D Jan 26), Sanford published a guest column in the Columbia newspaper The State.[84] In the article, ""Obama's Symbolism Here"", Sanford wrote, ""I won't be voting for Barack Obama for president,"" but noted the ""historical burden"" borne by South Carolinians on the topic of race. He advised voters in South Carolina to take note of the symbolism of Obama's early success, with the knowledge that South Carolina was a segregated state less than fifty years earlier, and discouraged voting either for or against Obama on the basis of his race.
On a January 18, 2008 interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer,[85] Sanford discussed his Obama article. Wolf Blitzer asked, ""Give us your mind-set. Why did you think it was so important to write this piece right now at this critical moment?"" Sanford responded, ""Well, it plays into a larger conversation that we're having as a family of South Carolinians on, in fact, the [constitutional] structure of our government."" Also, Wolf Blitzer showed Sanford clips of recent comments made by John McCain and Mike Huckabee about the Confederate battle flag and asked Sanford, ""All right, two different positions, obviously. Who's right in this?"" Sanford responded, ""Well, it depends who you talk to."" Sanford elaborated that ""if you were to talk to the vast majority of South Carolinians, they would say that we do not need to be debating where the Confederate flag is or is not.""
Sanford attracted derision in the liberal blogosphere and among pundits and analysts on the left for a gaffe during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on July 13, 2008, when he had difficulty answering a question about differences between Senator McCain and incumbent President George W. Bush on economic policy.[86] ""I'm drawing a blank, and I hate when I do that, especially on television,"" joked Sanford.[87]
As early as January 2008, there had been anticipation that Sanford would run for President in 2012, and online support groups had sprung up on virtual social networks like Facebook in support of a Sanford ticket.[88][89]
Further boosting Sanford's profile in advance of a potential candidacy, which at the time the governor neither ruled out nor expressly hinted at,[90] he was elected as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2008[91] and was cited by Michael S. Steele, the Chairman of the Republican Party as one of four ""rising stars"" in the GOP (alongside Governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Sarah Palin of Alaska) in February 2009.[92] Sanford also received early support for a presidential run from the Republican Liberty Caucus.[93]
On February 22, 2009, Sanford declined to rule out a possible presidential bid in 2012, though he professed to have no current plans to run for national office.[94]
Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza said that revelations of an extramarital affair in June 2009 ended Sanford's chances of being a serious candidate in 2012.[95]
On January 4, 2010, Sanford admitted that, ""If there's anything that's abundantly clear, it's that I ain't running for president."" In the same Republican meeting, he also indicated that he would enter the private sector after his last 11 months as governor.[96]
Following completion of his service as governor in January 2011, Sanford moved to his family farm in Beaufort County, South Carolina, and later moved to a condominium in Charleston, South Carolina.[97] He has described this as a very quiet and spiritual time, and developed a Buddhist Christian life approach including a daily quiet time, practicing mindfulness, and emphasising everyone's 'shared human experience.'[98][99]
In October 2011, he was hired as a paid political contributor for Fox News Channel.[100] In August 2012, Sanford became engaged to his former mistress, Maria Belen Chapur.[101] The engagement was subsequently broken off in September, 2014.[4][5]
In December 2012, CNN reported that Sanford was considering a bid to retake his congressional seat. The previous holder, fellow Republican Tim Scott, had been appointed to the United States Senate by Governor Nikki Haley after the resignation of Senator Jim DeMint.[102] On December 22, 2012, Sanford sent an email to supporters, confirming rumors that he intended to run for Congress in 2013.[103]
Sanford formally launched his bid for Congress in early 2013. He quickly became a front-runner in a crowded field of 16 Republican candidates, because of his name recognition.[104]
On April 2, 2013, Sanford won his Republican House primary runoff against Curtis Bostic, a former Charleston County councilman. The special election was held on May 7, 2013 and Sanford defeated Democratic Party Candidate Elizabeth Colbert Busch.[105]
On April 17, 2013, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled support from the Sanford campaign in the wake of revelations that Jenny Sanford had filed a trespassing complaint against him on February 4.[106] According to the complaint, Jenny Sanford had caught her former husband sneaking out of her home in Sullivan's Island, using his cellphone as a flashlight. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, neither Mark nor Jenny Sanford may come to the other's house without permissiona condition Jenny Sanford alleged that Mark Sanford had flouted on numerous occasions despite Jenny Sanford filing a ""no trespass"" letter with the Sullivan's Island Police Department.[107] In a statement, Mark Sanford admitted that he'd gone to the house to watch the second half of Super Bowl XLVII with his son. He claimed to have tried to contact Jenny beforehand, but was unable to do so. Jenny Sanford filed the complaint the next morning. Several Republican operatives said that they were upset Sanford had known about this complaint for some time and failed to disclose it.[106]
Sanford was endorsed by FreedomWorks,[108] South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley,[109] U.S. Representative and House Speaker John Boehner,[110] State Senator Tom Davis,[111][112][113] former South Carolina State Treasurer Thomas Ravenel,[114] perennial candidate Ben Frasier,[115][116] former U.S. Representative from Texas Ron Paul[117][118][119] and his son, U.S. Senator from Kentucky Rand Paul.,[120][121] and on May 1, 2013, U.S. Senator and former U.S. Representative Tim Scott[122][123] and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham[124][125] endorsed Sanford.
Larry Flynt also endorsed him, saying ""His open embrace of his mistress in the name of love, breaking his sacred marriage vows, was an act of bravery that has drawn my support.[126]
On May 7, 2013, Sanford was once again elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 54.04% of the vote, defeating Elizabeth Colbert Busch.[127][128]
Sanford is unopposed for re-election in 2014.[129]
Sanford was sworn-in on May 15, 2013.
On June 5, 2014, Sanford introduced the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4803; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the data and methods that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses to classify personnel as law enforcement officers and to reclassify, as necessary, any staff of the Office of Inspection that are currently misclassified according to the results of that review.[130] Sanford said that ""even though there are federal standards in place that lay out how employees qualify for higher wages, the Transportation Security Administration pays some of their employees more for jobs they're not doing. That wouldn't make sense anywhere outside of government and our bill would help fix that problem by clarifying those employees' responsibilities.""[131] According to Sanford, accurately reclassifying employees who do not spent at least 50 percent of the time on law enforcement activities and putting them on an accurate pay scale would save the government $17 million a year.[132]
In 2000 Sanford's first book, The Trust Committed To Me, was published. It discussed term limits, and featured a foreword by Robert Novak.[134] A second book, titled Within Our Means, was scheduled to be published by Sentinel in 2010: however the contract was terminated by mutual agreement after the revelation of Sanford's extramarital affair.[135]

The district stretches from the state capital, Columbia, to the Georgia-South Carolina border. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the South Carolina Senate from 1985 to 2001.
He is a member of the House Republican Policy Committee and is an Assistant Republican Whip.[3]
In September 2009, Wilson received international attention when he interrupted a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama to the joint session of Congress by shouting ""You lie!""[4][5] The incident resulted in a formal rebuke by the House of Representatives largely along party lines.[6]
Wilson was re-elected in 2010 by a comfortable 9 percentage points over his nearest challenger and when he ran unopposed in the 2012 general election he was re-elected with 96% of the vote.


Wilson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Wray (ne Graves) and Hugh deVeaux Wilson.[7] Wilson obtained a bachelor's degree in political science from Washington and Lee University in 1969 where he joined Sigma Nu,[8] and obtained his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1972.[9][10] From 1972 to 1975, Wilson served in the United States Army Reserve, and then as a Staff Judge Advocate in the South Carolina Army National Guard assigned to the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade until retiring from military service as a colonel in 2003.[11]
Wilson was active in South Carolina Republican politics from a young age, participating in his first Republican campaign in 1962. As a teenager he joined the campaign of Congressman Floyd Spence, later working as an aide to Senator Strom Thurmond.
As a real estate attorney, Wilson co-accounted the law firm Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Taylor & Thomas[12] in West Columbia, where he practiced for over 25 years. Wilson was also a municipal judge in Springdale, South Carolina.[13]
In 1981 and 1982, during the first term of the Reagan Administration, Wilson served as deputy general counsel for former Governor Jim Edwards at the U.S. Department of Energy. Wilson is also a graduate of Morton Blackwell's Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia.[14]
Wilson was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 1984 as a Republican from Lexington County. He was re-elected four times, the last three times unopposed; Lexington County is one of the most Republican counties in the state. He never missed a regular legislative session in 17 years. After the Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1996, he became the first Republican to serve as Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. Wilson was a member of the Columbia College Board of Visitors and Coker College Board of Trustees.
During his tenure in the South Carolina Senate, Wilson was the primary sponsor of bills which included the following: establishing a National Guard license plate,[15] providing paid leave for state employees to perform disaster relief services,[16] and requiring men aged 1826 to register for the Selective Service System when applying for a driver's license.[17] In 2000, Wilson was one of seven senators who voted against removing the Confederate battle flag from being displayed over the state house.[18]
As of the 113th Congress, Wilson serves on three standing committees and various subcommittees overseeing specific areas of legislation. Wilson serves on the Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel;[19] he also serves on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.[20] He serves on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, for which he also is a member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.[21] As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Wilson serves on the Subcommittee on Europe[22] and Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia.[23] Wilson is a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Tea Party Caucus.
Like his former boss, Spence, Wilson is an ardent social and fiscal conservative, and a strong supporter of the military.[24] He is a member of the Republican Study Committee.
In 2003, Wilson voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, including its Section 1011 authorizing $250,000 annually of taxpayer money to reimburse hospitals for treatment of illegal immigrants. In 2009, Wilson changed to his current position opposing public funds for healthcare of illegal immigrants.[25] In the 2006 elections, he defeated Ellisor again, gaining 62.7 percent of the vote, and kept his House seat.[26] In the 2008 general election, he won 54 percent of the vote to Rob Miller's 46 percent,[27] the closest race in the district in 20 years.
Wilson has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills, concerning teacher recruitment and retention, college campus fire safety, National Guard troop levels, arming airline pilots, tax credits for adoptions, tax credits for living organ donors, and state defense forces.
As of January 2006, eight bills co-sponsored by Wilson have passed the House,[28] including H.R. 1973, the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, making safe water and sanitation an objective of U.S. assistance to developing countries.[29]
Wilson is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act[30] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[31]
He has cited as one of his proudest congressional achievements the Drafting Business Expensing Act of 2003[citation needed], which allows businesses to immediately write-off fifty percent of the cost of business equipment and machinery. This bonus depreciation provision has been extended for 2008 and 2009 in two separate stimulus bills.[32][33] In addition, Wilson spearheaded the Drafting Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 2003, which offers higher education loan forgiveness to math, science and special education teachers in schools with a predominantly low income student population.[34] He cites as his most important vote the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[34]
On September 9, 2009, Wilson shouted at President Barack Obama while Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to outline his proposal for reforming health care.[35] During his address, Obama said: ""There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false  the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.""[36] In a breach of decorum,[37] Wilson pointed at Obama and shouted, ""You lie!"" twice.[38][39][40][41] Wilson attracted national and international attention for the incident.[42][43] He said afterwards that his outburst reflected his view that the bill would provide government-subsidized benefits to illegal immigrants.[44]
Then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel immediately approached senior Republican lawmakers and asked them to identify the heckler and urge him to apologize immediately.[45] Members of Congress from both parties condemned the outburst. ""Totally disrespectful"", said Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) of Wilson's utterance. ""No place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately.""[46][47] Wilson said later in a statement:
This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill. While I disagree with the President's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility.[48]
Obama later accepted Wilson's apology. ""I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes"", he said. ""He apologized quickly and without equivocation and I'm appreciative of that.""[49]
House Democrats called on Wilson to issue a formal apology on the House floor.[50] Wilson refused, saying in a televised interview that, ""I believe one apology is sufficient.""[51] Most Congressional Republicans agreed, and opposed further action.[52] On September 15, the House approved a ""resolution of disapproval"" against Wilson, on a nearly party-line 240179 vote.[53]
Several fact-checking organizations wrote that Wilson's views were inaccurate because HR 3200 expressly excludes undocumented aliens from receiving government-subsidized ""affordability credits"".[54][55][56] The non-partisan Congressional Research Service agreed that people would need to be lawfully present in the U.S. in order to be eligible for the credits, but noted that the bill did not bar non-citizens from buying their own health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchange.[57][58] The Obama administration said that, in the final bill, illegal immigrants would not be able to participate in the Exchange.[59] Prior to Obama's speech, Democrats had twice rejected amendments to the bill requiring documentation of legal status in the United States in order to receive benefits under the proposed plan, contending that a more complex application process would delay or prevent citizens from receiving health care.[60] Such language was included in the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill, America's Healthy Future Act.[61][62]
In contrast to the criticism, many others strongly supported his actions, distrusting that the bill would actually exclude illegal aliens in practice, which allowed Joe Wilson to receive substantial political contributions and gain much notoriety.[63]
Former President Jimmy Carter said that the outburst was ""based on racism ... [t]here is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president"",[64][65][66] and characterized Wilson's act as ""dastardly"".[67][68] This view was echoed by entertainer and educator Bill Cosby.[69][70] However, others disagreed, including Maryland representative Donna Edwards, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[71][72] Alan Wilson, the Attorney General of South Carolina, said: ""There is not a racist bone in my dad's body. He doesn't even laugh at distasteful jokes.""[68] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, when asked about Carter's comments, stated that President Barack Obama ""does not believe that criticism comes based on the color of his skin.""[73][74][75]
Following the incident, both Wilson and Rob Miller, his subsequent 2010 general election opponent, experienced a significant upswing in campaign donations. In the week after Wilson's outburst, Miller raised $1.6 million, about three times his 2008 campaign,[76] while Wilson raised $1.8 million.[77] By September 30, 2009, Wilson had out-paced Miller's fundraising by $2.65 million to $1.69 million respectively.[78] This fundraising surge led to Wilson writing fundraising letters for the Republican Party of Virginia[79] and the National Republican Congressional Committee.[80] Political observers described him as a ""GOP fundraising star.""[81][82]
On a 2002 live broadcast of the C-SPAN talk show Washington Journal, guests Wilson and Democratic congressman Bob Filner were discussing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. When Filner noted that the US provided Iraq with ""chemical and biological weapons"" in the 1980s, Wilson incorrectly stated that this idea was ""made up"" and commented to Filner, ""This hatred of America by some people is just outrageous. And you need to get over that."" Wilson apologized for his remarks in statements to the press.[83][84]
In 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams revealed that she was the daughter of Wilson's former employer, the late Senator Strom Thurmond, and Thurmond's black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child out of wedlock. Wilson said even if her story was true, she should not have revealed it because ""it's a smear"" on Thurmond's image and was a way to ""diminish"" Thurmond's legacy.[85] After Thurmond's family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams' revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that she should not have revealed that Thurmond was her father.[86]
In November 2009, the New York Times reported that Joe Wilson and Blaine Luetkemeyer made identical written statements, saying that ""One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India."" The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech, now a Swiss biotechnology firm, but originally founded, and still headquartered in South San Francisco, CA.[87]
Wilson was elected in 2001 in a special election caused by the death of Spence, his former boss. Wilson once said that a dying Spence called him from his hospital bed and asked him to run.[88] In a crowded five-way Republican primarythe real contest in this heavily Republican districtWilson tallied 75 percent of the vote, more than enough to win the nomination outright. He prevailed in the December 18 special election with 73 percent of the vote.[89][90] Wilson won election to a full term in 2002 with 84 percent of the vote, facing four minor-party candidates.[89][91]
Wilson was mentioned as a possible candidate for retiring Senator Fritz Hollings' seat in 2004,[92] but he decided to run for a second full term and beat his opponents, Democrat Michael Ellisor and Constitution Party nominee Steve Lefemine, with 65 percent of the vote.[89][93]
Wilson won re-election in November 2008, defeating the Democratic nominee, Iraq War veteran Rob Miller, 54% to 46%. It was the closest race in the district in 20 years, and the closest race that Wilson had ever faced in 24 years as an elected official. He only survived by winning his native Lexington County by 33,000 votes, more than the overall margin of 26,000 votes.
Challenged by Democratic nominee Rob Miller, Libertarian nominee Eddie McCain, and Constitution Party nominee Marc Beaman,[94] Wilson won re-election on November 2, 2010, defeating Miller 53% to 44%.
In the November 2012 general election, Joe Wilson ran unopposed and was re-elected with 96% of the vote.
Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, write-ins received 71 votes. In 2001, write-ins received 1 vote. In 2002, write-ins received 371 votes. * Floyd Spence died in office, causing the 2001 special election to be held. Wilson served the remainder of the term.

He is currently the President and CEO of J. Duncan Associates, a real estate marketing firm.
After redistricting, Duncan ran for South Carolina's 15th House District in 2002. In the Republican primary, he defeated David Tribble Jr, Clinton County Councilman, 56%-44%.[6] He won the general election with 62% of the vote.[7] In 2004, he won re-election to a second term unopposed.[8] In 2006, he won re-election to a third term with 63% of the vote.[9] In 2008, he won re-election to a fourth term unopposed.[10] In 2010, he retired in order to run for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Governor Mark Sanford called him a Tax Payer Hero. He was given the Guardian of Small Business award from the National Federation of Independent Businesses, an A+ rating from the Club for Growth, the Palmetto Leadership Award from the SC Policy Council, and Legislator of the Year from the SC Recreation and Parks Association and SC Wildlife Federation.[11]
Duncan was named Chairman of the House Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs Committee in 2007. He was appointed by the Speaker of the House to be the Chair of the Education Finance Study Committee, Natural Gas Offshore Drilling Study Committee and was appointed to represent the state of South Carolina on the Southern States Energy Board.[12]
He ran for South Carolina's 3rd congressional district when Republican incumbent U.S. Congressman J. Gresham Barrett ran for Governor of South Carolina. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth[13] and the National Right to Life Committee.[14] In the Republican primary, businessman Richard Cash ranked first with 25% but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Duncan ranked second in the six candidate field with 23%.[15] In the run-off election, Duncan defeated Cash 51%-49%, a vote difference of 2,171. Duncan won five of the district's ten counties, and were mostly located in the southern part of the CD.[16] He won the general election with 62% of the vote, 2% less than John McCain's 64% vote in`2008. He won nine of the district's ten counties, losing just McCormick (52%-47%). Duncan spent $935,503; Democrat Jane Dyer spent $272,698.[4][17]

In February, 2011, Duncan introduced a resolution to create a new Committee on the Elimination of Nonessential Federal Programs in an attempt to reduce federal outlays.[24]
On March 13, 2014, Duncan introduced the DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act (H.R. 4228; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of its major acquisition programs.[25] The bill would specify procedures for the department to follow if it fails to meet timelines, cost estimates, or other performance parameters for these programs.[25][26] Duncan argued that ""for years, DHS's purchases of major homeland security systems have been late, cost more, and done less than promised.

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes much of the Upstate region, including Greenville and Spartanburg.
Before his election to Congress, Gowdy was the solicitor (district attorney) for the state's Seventh Judicial Circuit, comprising Spartanburg and Cherokee counties. From 1994 to 2000, he was a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina.
In 2014, Gowdy became chairman of a House Select Committee to investigate the 2012 Benghazi attack.


Gowdy was born in Greenville, and grew up in Spartanburg. He considers Spartanburg his home. He is the son of Novalene (ne Evans) and Dr. Harold Watson ""Hal"" Gowdy, Jr.[1][2] Trey graduated from Spartanburg High School in 1982. He earned a B.A. in history from Baylor University in 1986. He was a member of Kappa Omega Tau, a service/social Fraternity while at Baylor University. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1989. In law school, he was a member of the scholastic honor society ""Wig and Robe.""
Gowdy and his wife Terri have two children: Watson and Abigail. Watson is a senior at Clemson University studying Philosophy, Political Science, and Law, as well as a lifelong avid golf enthusiast. Abigail is a 12th grader. His cousin Joey Paul Gowdy[3] is an actor and producer in the entertainment business who is related to sportcaster Curt Gowdy[4] and actress Karen Morris Gowdy. Terri Dillard Gowdy is a teacher's aide in Spartanburg School District.
Following law school, he clerked for John P. Gardner on the South Carolina Court of Appeals and United States District Court Judge Ross Anderson. He then went into private practice before becoming a federal prosecutor in April 1994. He was awarded the Postal Inspectors Award for the successful prosecution of J. Mark Allen, one of Americas Most Wanted suspects.
In February 2000, he left the United States Attorneys Office to run for 7th Circuit Solicitor. He defeated incumbent Solicitor Holman Gossett[5] in the Republican primary. He ran unopposed in the general election. He was reelected in 2004 and 2008, both times unopposed. During his tenure, he appeared on Forensic Files twice, as well as Dateline NBC and SCETV.[6] He prosecuted the full gamut of criminal cases including 7 death penalty cases.
When the state faced a budget crunch that forced many employees to go on unpaid furloughs, Gowdy funneled part of his campaign account into the solicitor's budget so his staff could keep working.[7]
In the summer of 2009, Gowdy announced that he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Bob Inglis in the Republican primary for South Carolina's 4th congressional district. Inglis, who got a 93% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, angered the conservative wing of the Republican Party by taking stances that were perceived to be more moderate than those he'd taken when he'd first represented the district from 1993 to 1999.[8] For instance, he'd angered conservatives in his district when he supported cap and trade as a result of his belief that global warming is man made.[9] He drew five Republican challengers, and Gowdy was one of them. Like most of the challengers, Gowdy ran well to Inglis' right.[8] In the June 2010 primary, Gowdy ranked first with 39% of the vote, short of the 50% majority threshold to win outright and avoid a run-off. Inglis received 27% of the vote. Jim Lee got 14%, State Senator David L. Thomas got 13%, and former Historian of the United States House of Representatives Christina Jeffrey was last with 7% of the vote.[10][11]
In the run-off election, Gowdy defeated Inglis 70%-30%.[12] The 4th is so heavily Republican that it was widely presumed Gowdy had assured himself of a seat in Congress.[13] Gowdy defeated Democratic nominee Paul Corden 63%-29%.[14]
Gowdy ran for reelection to a second term against Democrat Deb Morrow.[15] The original remap of the district cut part of Gowdy's home county, Spartanburg County, out of the district while leaving all of Greenville County in the district. Gowdy was initially ""disappointed"" with this version, even though it would have left the 4th as reliably Republican as its predecessor. However, the final map moved part of Greenville County to the 3rd and left all of Spartanburg County in the 4th. Gowdy was pleased with this version, since Greenville and Spartanburg counties remained together. Roll Call rated his district as Safe Republican in 2012.[16] Gowdy won re-election to a second term, defeating Morrow 65%-34%.[17]
Gowdy ran for reelection again in 2014. His only opponent was Libertarian Curtis E. McLaughlin.[18] He was reelected with 85.2% of the popular vote.
In August 2011 during the 2011 United States debt ceiling crisis, Gowdy opposed Speaker John Boehners debt limit bill, and he voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.[19] He also opposed the 2011 defense authorization bill, citing concerns about the prospect of Americans being detained without trial on national security grounds.[20] In December 2010, he told Congressional Quarterly that he would support a measure only if its sponsor could demonstrate that the Constitution gave the government the power to act in a particular realm.[7]
Gowdy worked on the Committee on Judiciary, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Gowdy frequently speaks on the floor of the House on issues ranging from Fast and Furious to his support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.
In 2012, he received the Defender of Economic Freedom award from the fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization Club for Growth. The award is given to the members of Congress who have the year's highest ranking, according to the Club for Growth's metrics. Gowdy scored 97 out of 100, and was one of 34 congressmen given the award.[21]
An ardent social conservative, Gowdy considers himself ""pro-life plus."" He not only believes ""in the sanctity of life,"" but argues that ""the strategy should be broader than waiting for the Supreme Court to revisit Roe v. Wade.""[22]
Trey Gowdy signed the Contract From America, which aims to defund, repeal, and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, limit United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations, enact a reform of the federal tax code, pass a balanced budget amendment, and end earmarks.[23][24]
On March 4, 2014, Gowdy introduced the ENFORCE the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 4138; 113th Congress) into the House.[25] The bill would give the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate both the standing to sue the President of the United States in a federal district court to clarify a federal law (that is, seek a declaratory judgment) in the event that the executive branch is not enforcing the law.[26][27] House Republicans argued that the bill was necessary because the Obama Administration refused to enforce the laws.[28] H.R. 4138 has passed the House but has yet to become law.
In total, Gowdy has sponsored 11 bills, including:[29]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. Mulvaney previously served as a member of the South Carolina Senate, representing the 16th district (Lancaster and York Counties),[1] from 2009 to 2011. He is the first Republican to represent South Carolina's 5th district since 1883.[2]


Mulvaney was born in Alexandria, Virginia and grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina before moving to Indian Land, South Carolina. Mulvaney attended Georgetown University where he majored in International Economics, Commerce and Finance. At Georgetown, he was an Honors Scholar, the highest level of academic achievement awarded to members of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, and ultimately graduated with honors in 1989. Mulvaney attended law school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He earned a full scholarship to attend law school, where his focus was on anti-trust law. He graduated with his law degree in 1992.[3]
From 1992 to 1997, Mulvaney practiced law with the firm James, McElroy & Diehl. Mulvaney joined his family's homebuilding and real estate business. He participated in the Owners and Presidents Management Program at Harvard Business School. In addition, he had been a minority shareholder and Owner-Operator in Salsarita's Fresh Cantina, a privately held regional restaurant chain.[4]
Mulvaney was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2006, becoming the first Republican ever elected to that position in his district.[5][not in citation given]
In 2008 an unexpected retirement created a vacancy in the South Carolina Senate and he campaigned for and won that office in what was widely regarded to be the hardest fought legislative race in South Carolina that year.[6][dead link]
While in the State Senate, Mulvaney served on the Judiciary, Labor/Commerce/Industry, Medical Affairs, Agriculture/Natural Resources, and Corrections Committees. The Palmetto Family Council identified him as the Freshman Legislator of the Year in 2006 for his work on the South Carolina ultrasound bill.[7] In 2010 he was named Legislator of the Year for his work in support of the State's Emergency Medical Services (EMS). He has received one of the few A+ ratings in the entire legislature from the South Carolina Club for Growth.[8][not in citation given]
Mulvaney, a GOP Young Gun, ran against Democratic incumbent John Spratt for South Carolina's 5th congressional district. The race was highlighted by Mitt Romney's Free and Strong America PAC's ""Take Congress Back: 10 in '10"" initiative as one of the top 10 House challenger races. During the campaign, Mulvaney's involvement in the now defunct Edenmoor real estate development in Lancaster County, South Carolina came to public attention.[9][dead link] Mulvaney's opponents alleged that Mulvaney misled the Lancaster County council and taxpayers to provide some $30 million in public funding for the Edenmoor real estate development and that once the public funds had been approved, Mulvaney sold his interest in the development to a third party at a substantial profit.[10][11][dead link] Mulvaney denied the allegations and claimed that the project's failure was due to Democratic economic policies.[10] Mulvaney defeated Spratt, who had held the seat since 1983; he received 55% of the vote to Spratt's 45%.[12]
Mulvaney's campaign against Spratt was aided by a 501(c)(4) organization named the Commission on Hope, Growth, and Opportunity. The group, which was established by anonymous donors and run by lobbyist Scott W. Reed, has been accused by the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington of violating federal campaign finance laws and disclosing false information to the Internal Revenue Service.[13]
He won re-election to a second term, by defeating Democrat Joyce Knott 56%-44%.[14][15]
He won re-election to a third term, by defeating Democrat Tom Adams, a Fort Mill Town Council[16] member, 59%-41%.[17]
On December 10, 2013, Republican Representative Paul Ryan and Democratic Senator Patty Murray announced that they had negotiated the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, a proposed two-year budget deal.[18][19] The budget deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014.[20] The proposed deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015.[20] This does not decrease federal spending; instead, by reducing the amount of spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increases government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester - $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.[21] The deal is supposed to make up for this increase in spending by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers.[18] According to The Hill, Mulvaney is ""spearheading opposition to the new budget bill.""[21] Mulvaney did not blame Ryan for the budget deal, instead saying that the problem was too few conservatives had been elected to Congress to pass a budget with a greater focus on debt reduction.[21] Mulvaney said that he expected the budget deal to pass because ""it was designed to get the support of defense hawks and appropriators and Democrats,"" not conservatives.[18]
On April 9, 2014, Representative Mulvaney offered a proposal based on the Obama proposal as a substitute amendment in order to force a vote on the President's budget request. The President's proposal failed in a vote of 2-413, although Democrats were urged by their leadership to vote against this ""political stunt.""[22]
He is the son of Mike and Kathy Mulvaney and has two siblings. Mulvaney married Pamela West in 1998; they have three children (a set of triplets).[23]"
"349","","1993","1940","South Carolina 6","South Carolina State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn","Jim Clyburn","Democratic","Political aide, teacher","African Methodist","James Enos ""Jim"" Clyburn (born July 21, 1940) is the U.S. Representative for South Carolina's 6th congressional district, serving since 1993, and the Assistant Democratic Leader since 2011.[1] He was previously House Majority Whip, serving in that post from 2007 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes large portions of Columbia and Charleston, as well as several rural areas between them.
As Assistant Democratic Leader, he is the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer.


Clyburn was born in Sumter, South Carolina, the son of Enos Lloyd Clyburn, a fundamentalist minister, and his wife, Almeta (ne Dizzley), a beautician.[2] A distant relative of his was George W. Murray, an organizer for the Colored Farmers Alliance (CFA), who was elected as a Republican South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late nineteenth century. He and other black politicians had strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially disfranchised most African-American citizens, a situation that the state maintained for more than half a century until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.
Clyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy) in Camden, S.C., then attended South Carolina State College (now South Carolina State University), a historically black college in Orangeburg. He was initiated into the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and graduated with a bachelor's degree in history.
For his first full-time position after college, Clyburn taught at C.A. Brown High School in Charleston.
After an unsuccessful run for the South Carolina General Assembly, he moved to Columbia to join the staff of Governor John C. West in 1971. He was appointed as the first minority advisor to a South Carolina governor. In the aftermath of the Orangeburg massacre of 1968, when protesting students at South Carolina State were killed by police,[3] West appointed Clyburn as the state's human affairs commissioner. He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress.
Following the 1990 census South Carolina's district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a black-majority district. Before this ruling, African Americans were a minority in all six of South Carolina's districts.
The reconfigured 6th stretched across most of South Carolina's Black Belt, but swept south to include most of the black precincts around Charleston and west to include most of the black precincts around Columbia, including Clyburn's home. Five-term incumbent Robin Tallon's home in Florence was in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic Party nomination for the seat. As this district was heavily Democratic, the primary was understood to be the real contest.
Clyburn secured 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for an expected run-off. As expected, he won the general election in November handily. He has been reelected eight times with no substantive Republican opposition. From 1998 to 2006, his opponent was Gary McLeod, a conservative Republican from Clarendon County.
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Nancy Harrelson by 68%-32%.[4]
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Jim Pratt, 65% to 34%.
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Anthony Culler, 73% to 25%.
Jim Clyburn was elected as vice-chairman of the House Democratic Caucus in 2003, the third-ranking post in the caucus.
He became the chairman of the Democratic Caucus in the House in early 2006 after the caucus chairman Bob Menendez was appointed to the Senate. After the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 election, Clyburn was unanimously elected as Majority Whip in the 110th Congress.
Clyburn would have faced a challenge from Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rahm Emanuel, but Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi persuaded Emanuel to run for Democratic Caucus Chairman.[5] Clyburn was interviewed by National Public Radio's Morning Edition on January 12, 2007, and acknowledged the difficulty of counting votes and rallying the fractious Democratic caucus, while his party held the majority in the House.
After the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost their majority in the House. The departing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would stand as Minority Whip, while a ""number three"" leadership position styled Assistant Leader would be created for Clyburn.[6] The exact responsibilities of Clyburn's assistant leader office remain unclear, though it is said to replace the Assistant to the Leader post previously held by Chris Van Hollen. He had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.[7][8]
In August 2014, Clyburn warned that he expects President Barack Obama to be impeached should Republicans hold onto control of the House of Representatives in November 2014. Republicans suggested that they do not plan to do so at this time and commentators considered the remark an effort to generate support for Democrats in the midterms. [9]
Clyburn is regarded as liberal in his political stances, actions and votes. A recent ranking by the National Journal ranked him as the 77th most liberal of all 435 US congressional representatives, and with a score of 81, indicating that the conductors of this study found his voting record to be more liberal than 81 percent of other members of the US House of Representatives based on their recent voting records.[10]
Clyburn has an established liberal stance on health care, education, organized labor and environmental conservation issues, based on his legislative actions as well as evaluations and ratings by pertinent interest groups.[11]
In 2009, Clyburn introduced the Access for All Americans Act. The $26billion sought by this Act would provide funding to quadruple the number of community health centers in the US that provide medical care to uninsured and low-income citizens.[12]
The American Public Health Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, The Childrens Health Fund and other health care interest groups rate Clyburn highly based on his voting record on pertinent issues. Other groups in this field, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, give Clyburn ratings of zero.[13]
Despite his opposition to partial-birth abortion, Clyburn is regarded to be pro-choice on the issue of abortion, as shown by his high ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, and low rating from the National Right to Life Committee.[14]
Clyburn has continuously sought new and additional funding for education. He has gained additional funding for special education[15] and lower interest rates on federal student loans.[16] In many sessions has Clyburn sought, sponsored and/or voted for improvements in Pell Grant funding for college loans.[17]
The National Education Association and the National Association of Elementary School Principals rate Clyburn very high, as do other education interest groups.[18]
Although he was criticized for a previous expenditure of 160 million dollars to expand South Carolina's ports, he stated he would continue to make funding available for further expansions. The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal which is currently being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through. This is due primarily because of larger commercial ships coming from China, and also China's extremely high demand of soy beans, which are produced in South Carolina, but must be sent to larger ports for exporting. This measure will benefit South Carolina business and farmers and is thus heavily backed by these groups.[19]
Clyburn has consistently voted for increases in minimum wage income and to restrict employer interference with labor union organization.[20]
Many national labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, the Communication Workers Association and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, give Clyburn outstanding ratings based on his voting record on issues that pertain to labor and employment.[21]
Clyburn has opposed legislation to increase offshore drilling for oil or natural gas. Instead, he has promoted use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, cheaper than wind and solar energy. [22] Members of the nuclear power industry have expressed that there is a mutual respect between Clyburn and themselves.[23] Clyburn pushed for a 2010 contract to convert plutonium from old weapons into nuclear fuel.[23][24]
Clyburn has been viewed favorably by organizations such as the League of Conservation Voters and Defenders of Wildlife.[25] However, he did anger environmentalists when he proposed building a $150 million bridge across a swampy area of Lake Marion in Calhoun county.
On July 31, 2007, Clyburn said in a broadcast interview that it would be a ""real big problem"" for the Democratic Party if General David Petraeus issued a positive report in September, as it would split the Democratic caucus on whether to continue to fund the Iraq War. While this soundbite caused some controversy, the full quote was, in reference to 47 member Blue Dog caucus, ""I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the Republicans were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us.""[26]
Clyburn negatively viewed Bill Clinton's remarks regarding Barack Obama winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Rev. Jesse Jackson's win in the 1988 primary election.[27] ""Black people are incensed all over this,"" said Clyburn. Clinton responded that the campaign ""played the race card on me,"" denying any racial tone in the comment.[28] Speaking with the New York Times, Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between the former president and his once most reliable constituency. ""When he was going through his impeachment problems, it was the black community that bellied up to the bar,"" Clyburn said. ""I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation.""[27]
During the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, Clyburn supported Dick Gephardt until he dropped out of the race and afterwards supported John Kerry. He was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.[29]
Clyburn, a superdelegate, remained uncommitted throughout most of the 2008 presidential primary elections. He eventually endorsed Obama on June 3 immediately before the South Dakota primary (the result of said primary would have otherwise secured his party's nomination).[30][31]
Clyburn's eldest daughter, Mignon Clyburn, was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission by President Obama.[32]

She is a farmer, rancher and small business owner by profession.


Kristi Lynn Arnold was born to Ron and Corinne Bergan Arnold in Watertown, South Dakota and raised with her three siblings on the family ranch and farm in rural Hamlin County.[3] Growing up, she participated in rodeo queen events, learning horsemanship and interview skills.[4] She graduated from Hamlin High School in 1990, and won the South Dakota Snow Queen title, which required that she enroll in a state university and promote the state during her reign.[3] She credited the experience with helping her polish her public speaking and promotional skills.[4] After high school, she enrolled at Northern State University. She married Bryon Noem at the age of 20, then left college at age 22 to help run her family's ranch after her father was killed in a farm machinery accident.[3][5]
Upon her father's 1994 death, Noem has said she and her family members decided to take out a loan to pay taxes owing on the estate, noting that ""for 10 years that loan really impacted our ability to make a profit"".[6] The property, of which Noem's family owns a non-controlling partnership in, has also received $3,058,152 in USDA farm subsidies from 1995 through 2009.[7] Over the years, Noem added a hunting lodge and restaurant to the property, and all of her siblings have moved back to assist in expanding the businesses.[3]
After her early marriage, Noem stopped attending college full-time but, over the years, took classes at the Watertown Campus of Mount Marty College, and South Dakota State University.[3][4] After being elected to Congress, she continued her education, taking online courses and receiving credits for her work as a representative  leading the Washington Post to dub her Capitol Hill's ""Most Powerful Intern.""[8] She earned a degree in political science from South Dakota State in May 2012.[9]
Noem entered political life by serving on local committees and boards.[6] In 2006, she won a seat in the South Dakota House of Representatives representing the 6th District (comprising parts of Beadle, Clark, Codington, Hamlin, and Kingsbury counties, but not including the city of Watertown). In 2006, she won ranked first with 39% of the vote.[10] In 2008, she won re-election to a second term, ranking first with 41% of the vote.[11]
Noem served for four years, from 2007 to 2010, and was an Assistant Majority Leader during her last year.[12][13]
According to the Daily Caller, Noem was noted for being a tough and knowledgeable state legislator. She publicly accused a state senator of a conflict of interest during a legislative hearing thus killing his effort to stop the construction of an Indian casino.[6] In 2009 and 2010 she sponsored bills to lower the age of compulsory education in South Dakota to 16, after it had been raised to 18 in 2008, arguing that requiring school attendance until age 18 has not been proven to improve graduation rates.[14] Supporters of the higher age argue that it increases graduation rates and provides motivation for students who would otherwise drop out.[15]
On June 8, 2010, Noem ran for South Dakota's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.[17] She won the Republican primary with a plurality of 42% of the vote against South Dakota Secretary of State Chris Nelson and State Representative Blake Curd.[18] According to Sabato's Crystal Ball blog, Noem's ""victory over two A-list opponents"" was impressive.[18] Her primary opponents endorsed her in the general election.[12]
Noem's opponent, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, emphasized her own record of independence from the Democratic caucus including her no votes on health care reform, the Wall Street bailouts, and the cap-and-trade energy bill. In response, Noem repeatedly highlighted Herseth Sandlin's vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. A Washington Post story on the race described Noem as ""a made-for-Fox News star"" and described her as a ""mama grizzly"" in the mold of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[19] During the 2010 election cycle, Noem out-raised Herseth Sandlin $2.3 million to $2.1 million.[20][21] Of those totals, Noem received 84 percent of her cash from individual contributors while Herseth Sandlin received 56% from political action committees.[20][21] Mitt Romney's PAC made a donation to Noem's campaign, and Romney endorsed her.[22]
Gallup polls in June 2010 showed Republican candidates ahead of their Democratic counterparts due to dissatisfaction with President Obama.[22] Polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports consistently gave a Noem a slight edge over Herseth Sandlin following the June GOP primary, with Noem pulling ahead 47 percent to 44 percent in early October.[23] Critics said the Rasmussen firm's surveying methods were erratic and tended to favor Republican candidates.[24] Noem defeated Herseth Sandlin 48%46%.[25]
Noem won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Matthew Varilek 57%-43%.[26]
Noem won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Corinna Robinson 67%-33%.[27]
Noem is the fourth woman to represent South Dakota in the U.S. Congress.[28]
Noem and fellow freshman congressman Tim Scott of South Carolina, were elected by acclamation of the 2011 House Republican 87-member freshman class to be liaisons to the House Republican leadershipmaking Noem the second woman member of House GOP leadership.[6][29] According to The Hill Noem's role was to push the leadership to make significant cuts to federal government spending and to help Speaker John Boehner manage the expectations of the freshman class.[30] On March 2, 2011, Republican Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas named Noem one of the twelve regional directors for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2012 election campaign.[3][31]
Noem has been active promoting legislation to end human trafficking and sexual slavery. On February 23, 2014, Noem held a conference to promote anti-trafficking legislation in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.[32][33] Noem is a co-sponsor of H.R.4058 in the 113th Congress (2013-2014) Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act[33] and other U.S. House resolutions designed to end human trafficking.[33]
Noem fulfilled a campaign promise by voting in January 2011 to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,[34][35] Though the repeal was not signed into law, she has stated that she will work with the House members to defund the health care reform, while retaining measures she supports such as[3] the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plan into their 20s and the high-risk pools.[36] New provisions that Noem wants to add to federal law include limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and allowing patients to buy health insurance plans from other states.[36] She supports cuts to Medicaid funding proposed by Republican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan that would reduce benefits for South Dakota Medicaid recipients by 55 percent.[37]
Noem calls the budget deficit one of the most important issues facing Congress, and is a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 2, which would require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts.[38][39] She cites the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, high-speed rail projects, cap-and-trade technical assistance, and subsidies for the Washington Metro rapid transit system as examples of a federal programs where she would like to see spending cuts.[37][38][40][41]
She indicated that she would vote to raise the federal spending limit.[29] She wants to eliminate the estate tax,[42] lower the corporate tax rate, and simplify the tax code to make it less cumbersome.[3] She has also stated that she would not raise taxes to balance the budget.[43]
On the issue of abortion, Noem is pro-life.[44] She has the support of Susan B. Anthony List.[45] She stated after her election that she hopes to maintain a 100 percent pro-life voting record.[42] During her tenure in the State House, Noem voted in favor of the death penalty on several occasions, including a bill changing South Dakota's formula for the lethal injection cocktail.
Noem has stated that the U.S. must end its dependence on foreign oil. To achieve that goal, Noem says Congress should encourage conservation of existing resources.[46] Noem believes the U.S. government should also offer incentives for new ideas.[46] She supports continuing ethanol subsidies that benefit her state.[47] Noem opposes ending federal subsidies for oil companies.[37]
Noem supports the Keystone XL Pipeline and has promised to continue to work for its construction even though the U.S. Senate voted down legislation to advance the pipeline through the U.S. Congress.[48] Noem helped the House pass the legislation on November 14, 2014.[48]
Noem opposes a bill introduced by South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson that would designate over 48,000 acres (190km2) of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness.[49] Noem supports the current designation of the land as a national grassland.[50] She points out that the land is already managed as roadless areas similar to wilderness.[51] Noem argues that raising the land's designation from protected grassland to wilderness will further limit leaseholders access to the land and further imperil grazing rights.[50][51]
She supports off-shore oil drilling.[52] She co-sponsored three bills that she argues will reduce American dependence on foreign oil by ending the 2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and re-opening sales on oil leases in the Gulf and off the coast of Virginia.[53]
Noem supported the American military intervention in 2011 conflict in Libya, but questioned whether America intervened to protect civilians, or whether the U.S. military would try to remove Libya's leader, Muammar Gaddafi.[54] In March 2011, Noem called on the President to provide more information about America's role in the conflict, characterizing his statements as vague and ambiguous.[54][55]
Since her election, Noem has raised 56 percent of donations from individuals and 44 percent from political action committees.[56] On March 8, 2011, Noem announced the formation of a leadership political action committee called KRISTI PAC.[57] Noem said she will use the PAC to pay expenses and support other Republican candidates. Former South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby is the treasurer of the PAC.[58][59][60]
Noem was among the top freshman Republicans in PAC fundraising in the first quarter of 2011, raising $169,000 from PACs and hosting at least 10 Washington fundraisers.[61] She is a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee. She has said she has no plans to join the House Tea Party Caucus.[62]
In August 2013, conservative Newsmax magazine named Noem among the ""25 most influential women in the GOP"".[63]
Kristi Noem electoral history

Noem lives with her husband and their three children on the Racota Valley Ranch near Castlewood.[66] As of 2009, she had a 16.9 percent ownership stake in the ranch.[67] Her recreational interests include hunting.[68]
From 1989 to 2010, Noem received 27 traffic citations, including 20 for speeding,[69] as well as other various moving violations. Noem said, ""I'm not proud of my driving record, but [I've] been working hard to be a better example to young kids and young drivers out there.""[70] She had paid her fines and penalties by August 2010.[69]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in the Tri-Cities area in the northeastern portion of the state.


Roe was born on July 21, 1945 in Clarksville, Tennessee. He graduated from Austin Peay State University in 1967 and earned his Medical Degree from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine in 1972.[1]
After graduating from medical school, Roe served in the United States Army Medical Corps, attached to the 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Casey, South Korea. He was discharged as a major in 1974.[2] He then went into OB/GYN practice in Johnson City, retiring after 31 years, including his work as a physician State of Franklin Healthcare Associates (SOFHA). SOFHA was founded in 1997.[3] After first being elected into the U.S. House of Representatives, Roe purchased a 1.8% ownership share of State of Franklin Healthcare Associates Real Estate Partners with property holdings within the Med-Tech Regional Business Park located in the northern section of Johnson City, Tennessee.
Roe was first elected to the Johnson City Commission in 2003, serving as vice mayor of Johnson City from 20032007 and then as mayor from 2007 to 2009.[4]
Roe defeated incumbent congressman David Davis in the 2008 primary by 500 votes.[5] Davis blamed his loss on votes from Democrats who crossed over to vote for Roe in the open primary.[6] Roe had previously run for the seat in 2006 when 10-year incumbent Bill Jenkins announced his retirement, but lost to Davis in that year's primary.
Roe defeated Democrat Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at East Tennessee State University,[7] in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote. However, it was widely presumed that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.
Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.[8]
In a district known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington, U.S. Rep. Phil Roe has promised to serve only 12 years (six terms) in the House.
Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman Robin Hayes, as his chief of staff.[9] According to National Journals 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.[10]
On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would authorize the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield.[11] Roe said ""I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward.""[12]
During June 2013, WJHL TV of Johnson City, Tennessee reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in Greeneville, Tennessee on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were ""money and greed"" and because that decision by Kincaid created a ""substantial risk of harm to patients,"" prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.[13]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Knoxville.


Duncan was born in Lebanon, Tennessee. His ""paternal grandparents were small farmers in Scott County, which in 1861 left Tennessee, refusing to follow the Volunteer State into the Confederacy, and declared itself 'the Free and Independent state of Scott.'""[2] Duncan's parents were Lois (Swisher) and John Duncan, Sr., who ""hitchhiked into Knoxville with five dollars in his pocket,' and after an education at the University of Tennessee was elected mayor of Knoxville and then congressman.""[2] The elder Duncan was also a co-owner of the Knoxville Smokies of the ""Sally League,"" for which his son ""was a batboy, a ball shagger, scoreboard operator, and, as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, the Smokies public-address announcer.""[2] Duncan also worked as a grocery bagger and salesman at Sears while working his way through school. Duncan supported Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, and sent the first paycheck he earned as a bagboy at the local A&P to the Goldwater campaign.[2]
Duncan graduated from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1969 with a Bachelor of Journalism degree and subsequently received a Juris Doctor degree from George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. in 1973 and was admitted to the bar that same year. He also served in the Army National Guard from 1970 to 1987. He was an attorney in private practice until he became a state court judge in Knox County, Tennessee, where he served from 1981 to 1988.
The Lincoln Memorial University Duncan School of Law in Knoxville, TN was named after Jimmy Duncan.[3]
He was first elected to Congress in 1988, in a special election to succeed his late father, John Duncan, Sr. and elected to the seat for a full term in his own right the same day. He has been re-elected every two years since then from a district that has been held continuously by Republicans (or their antecedents) since 1859, and by a Duncan since his father was first elected in 1964.[2] He has never faced a serious or well-funded challenge for reelection, and was reelected without major-party opposition from 1994 through 2000.
Duncan voted against authorizing the War in Iraq based on opposition to what he believed to be an unnecessary foreign involvement. He also opposed and voted against a June 2006 House declaration in support of the war.[4] He was one of the most conservative Republicans to do so.[5] Duncan later remarked that the Iraq War vote had been
Duncan and Ron Paul were among the only six Republicans to vote against funding for the Iraq War on May 24, 2007.[6] Duncan voted, along with three other Republicans, to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008 on July 12, 2007.[7]
On March 10, 2010, Duncan again joined three other Republicans in voting for the removal of troops from Afghanistan.[8] Duncan and Paul were the only members of Congress to vote for the removal of troops from Afghanistan and against all recent bailout and stimulus bills.[9]
Duncan is a member of the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of libertarian-minded congressional Republicans.[10] Congressman Ron Paul hosts a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday. Other members include Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, and Jeff Flake of Arizona. A former neighbor of his district, Zach Wamp of the 3rd district, also belonged to the group during his tenure in the House.[11] He voted against the Wall Street bailout. Duncan, in a column explaining his vote, stated he ""thought it would be better in the long run not to adopt the socialist approach.""[12] The American Conservative Union gave Duncan a 96% score for his voting record in 2013, higher than any other federal Representative in Congress from Tennessee.[13]
The Family Research Council has rated Duncan as a 92% or above since 2002[5] and the NRA has rated him in equally positive terms.[5] In 2012, Duncan received the number one spot in the 435-member House in the National Taxpayers Unions (NTU) annual ranking of Congress, earning him the Taxpayer Hero award.
Duncan is a frequent contributor to Chronicles and The American Conservative, both magazines associated with the paleoconservative movement. He has also contributed to numerous trade publications and Capitol Hill newspapers. Duncan has also voiced public support for returning the gold standard.[14]
Duncan and his wife Lynn have four children and six grandchildren.[15]"

The district is based in Chattanooga and includes a large swath of East Tennessee, including Oak Ridge. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Fleischmann was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York,[4][5][6] and is a resident of Ooltewah, an unincorporated suburban community east of Chattanooga. He is the son of Rose Marie (ne Salvo) and Max Fleischmann, Jr. His father was of half Austro-Hungarian and half English ancestry, and his mother was of Italian descent (Fleischmann's maternal grandparents had both immigrated from Italy).[7][8] Fleischmann is a Roman Catholic.[6]
Fleischmann received a B.A. in Political Science at the University of Illinois.[3] He also received both Phi Beta Kappa and Magna Cum Laude honors. He received his juris doctor at the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville. He then moved to Chattanooga and in 1987 founded his own law firm, Fleischmann and Fleischmann. He is a former President at Chattanooga Bar Association and former Chairman of the Chattanooga Lawyers Pro Bono Committee.
Fleischmann is married to Brenda M. Fleischmann. They have three sons, and live in Ooltewah.
Republican incumbent Zach Wamp decided to retire in order to run for Governor, leaving this an open seat. The Republican primary was very crowded because of the heavy Republican nature of the district. There were eleven candidates on the ballot, and none of them had political experience. His biggest competition came from former state GOP chairwoman Robin Smith.[9] She was endorsed by former Speaker of the U.S. House Newt Gingrich and The Club for Growth. Fleischmann won the primary with a plurality of 30% of the vote. He defeated second-place finisher Smith by 1,415 votes. He won most of the counties in the district, which were mostly in the northern part of the district, while Smith won three counties: Rhea, Hamilton, and Polk counties. Third place finisher Tim Gobble won only single county: Bradley.[10][11]
His Democratic opponent in the general election was John Wolfe, a fellow attorney. Fleischmann faced Wolfe in his first case as an attorney. He said he won that case and the appeal ""and now I want to defeat him a third time.""[12] His other opponent was independent candidate Savas Kyriakidis, an attorney, restaurant owner and Iraq War veteran.[13] Fleischmann won the race with 57% of the vote.[14]
For his first re-election campaign, Fleischmann defeated Scottie Mayfield and Weston Wamp in the Republican primary, 39%-31%-29%.[15] He faced Democrat Mary Headrick in the general election of November 2012 and won with a large majority of the vote.[16]
Rep. Fleischmann has always been a firm supporter of 2nd Amendment rights. He has received an A rating from the interest groups ""National Rifle Association Political Fund Positions on Gun Rights"" and ""Gun Owners of America Positions on Gun Rights"". He supports legislation that allows licensed firearm owners to carry out their God-given right more freely because the right to carry a firearm is a right that allows law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and is crucial to the freedom of our country. On November 16, 2011 Fleischmann voted Yea on the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, which would allow a resident of a state that allows concealed carry to possess a firearm while visiting another state that has different firearm laws.
Rep. Fleischmanns first vote in office was the 2011 motion Repealing the Health Care Bill which he supported.
In July 2011, Fleischmann originally supported Speaker John Boehners debt limit bill, but he voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.[17]
On November 16th 2011 Fleischmann voted for a bill that encourages the display of In God We Trust in public buildings and schools and reinforces it as our nations motto.
In November 2011 Rep. Fleischmann filed a new bill called the Stop Green Initiative Abuse Act of 2011 which would repeal the Department of Energys Weatherization Assistance Program. This program attempts to assist low-income families in lowering their energy bills by adding energy efficient caulking and insulation to homes. A December 2010 report from the Tennessee Comptrollers Office concluded that funds for the program had been wasted or misspent. Fleischmanns office estimates that if this bill passes it would save taxpayers $2.1 billion over the next decade. This is the third bill he has proposed."

He is a member of the Republican Party.


DesJarlais was born in 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa,[3] the son of Joe DesJarlais, a barber, and Sylvia, a registered nurse at Fort Meade Veterans' Hospital in South Dakota. He has undergraduate degrees in Chemistry and Psychology from the University of South Dakota and earned his Doctor of Medicine from the University of South Dakota School of Medicine. He was originally from Sturgis, South Dakota, and moved to East Tennessee in 1993.[4] Today, DesJarlais practices medicine at Grand View Medical Center in Jasper, Tennessee.[5]
In 2009, DesJarlaiswho had never run for elected office beforefiled papers to challenge Democratic incumbent Lincoln Davis,[6] as well as Independents Paul H. Curtis, James Gray, Richard S. Johnson, and Gerald York.[7] DesJarlais defeated Davis 57%-39%,[8] the third-largest defeat of a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle, and the first time that an incumbent had been unseated in the district since its creation in 1983.
DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and state senator Eric Stewart. Prior to the 2012 election, the Fourth District was significantly altered as a result of redistricting. Notably, Murfreesboro, formerly the heart of the 6th District, was shifted into the 4th. The redrawn 4th contains about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties being moved elsewhere by redistricting.[9] For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator Bill Ketron, a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee. However, Ketron decided that he wouldn't run.
During the election campaigns, events from DesJarlais' personal life became public, making the 2012 race against Stewart ""one of the ugliest Tennessee congressional races in decades"".[10] Stories that surfaced included the fact that during the divorce proceedings, DesJarlais' first wife Susan had alleged that her ex-husband engaged in ""violent and threatening behavior"".[11] Court filings revealed that he had at least four affairs.[12] One was with a female patient. According to the Huffington Post, tapes that DesJarlais himself recorded, show that he pressured her to have an abortion after she became pregnant.[13][14] A second woman came forward, stating that she began dating DesJarlais while she was his patient. She alleges that the two smoked marijuana together and he prescribed pain medications for her while at his house.[15]
In October 2012, the non-profit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington requested that the Tennessee Department of Health investigate evidence that DesJarlais had a sexual relationship with a patient, an allegation that could open the congressman to disciplinary action for potentially violating medical ethics.[16][17] In November 2012, the same group filed another complaint against DesJarlais with the Office of Congressional Ethics, claiming that the Congressman lied about a telephone conversation with a former patient and mistress.[18]
DesJarlais defeated Stewart 56%-44%[19][20] joining all the other incumbent members of Tennessee congressional delegation who also won their re-election bids.[21]
DesJarlais is considered one of the most vulnerable Congressmen, because of revelations in October 2012 that he had prescribed drugs to a patient with whom he was having an affair and had pressured his former wife and former mistress to have several abortions. He was re-elected in 2012 with a reduced majority.[22] Despite these vulnerabilities, in the final days before the August 7 primary DesJarlais seems to have a chance at holding onto his seat, according to Republican operatives who think voters have forgiven his behavior.[23]
State Senator Jim Tracy was challenging DesJarlais in the primary.[24] As of the end of June 2013, Tracy had raised nearly $750,000 (including over $300,000 in the second quarter of 2013) for his bid.[25] He raised an additional $150,000 in the fourth quarter and reported $840,000 cash-on-hand.[22] By contrast, at the end of September, DesJarlais reported $170,000 cash-on-hand.[22] DesJarlais won the primary by a margin of 38 votes. Tracy decided not to challenge the results, despite citing irregularities.
DesJarlais and his second wife, Amy, have three children. They live in Jasper, a town about 30 miles west of Chattanooga, in Marion County. DesJarlais divorced his first wife, Susan, in 2001; they have one child.[26]
On November 15, 2012two weeks after the electionthe Chattanooga Times Free Press obtained a transcript of DesJarlais' 2001 divorce proceeding with his first wife. It revealed that DesJarlais had admitted under oath to at least six sexual relationships with people he came in contact with while chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper. Among them were at least two patients. The state Democratic Party had fought to get the transcript released before the election, but the transcriptwhich ran to 679 typed pageswas not complete at the time. The transcript also revealed that contrary to his staunch anti-abortion stance as a congressman, he had counseled his then-wife to have two abortions and pressured one of the patients with whom he'd had an affair to get an abortion. Additional transcripts revealed that he had prescribed pain pills to at least one patient with whom he'd had an affaira clear conflict of interest.[27][28][29]
In July 2014, DesJarlais announced he was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy to treat lymphoma.[30]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Blue Dog Coalition. He previously represented Tennessee's 4th congressional district from 1983 to 1995.


Cooper was born in Nashville and raised in Shelbyville, Tennessee.[1] He is the son of former governor Prentice Cooper and his wife Hortense.[2] Jim Cooper attended the Episcopal boys' boarding school Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts[3] and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a member of the Alpha Sigma Chapter of the Chi Psi fraternity, a recipient of the Morehead-Cain Scholarship, and earned a B.A. in history and economics. Cooper won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford, where he was a member of Oriel College and earned a B.A./M.A. in politics and economics in 1977. In 1980, he received a J.D. from Harvard Law School.
After getting his law degree, he spent two years working for the law firm Waller, Lansden, Dortch and Davis in Nashville, then ran for Congress in 1982.[4]
In 1982, Cooper won the Democratic primary for the 4th District, which had been created when Tennessee gained a district after the 1980 census. The new 4th ran diagonally across the state, from heavily Republican areas near Tri-Cities, Knoxville and Chattanooga to the fringes of the Nashville suburbs. The district stretched across five media markets - the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol), Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Huntsville, Alabama - so the 1982 race had much of the feel of a statewide race. Owing to the district's demographics, many felt that whoever won the election would almost instantly become a statewide figure with a high potential for election to statewide office in the future. Cooper defeated Cissy Baker, an editor in Washington for the Cable News Network and the daughter of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker[5] with 66 percent of the vote. He was reelected five more times with little substantive opposition, running unopposed in 1986 and 1988. This was somewhat surprising, given the district's volatile demographics. The district, then as now, was split between areas with strong Democratic and Republican voting histories. Indeed, prior to Cooper's election, much of the eastern portion of the 4th hadn't been represented by a Democrat since the Civil War. However, the size of the district makes it extremely difficult to unseat an incumbent.
Cooper has always been a staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the movement to loosen federal gun laws, and during his 1984 election campaign, the NRA donated a sum to his campaign that approached the legal limit of $10,000.[6]
In 1992 Cooper was co-author of a bipartisan health-care reform plan, that did not include employer mandates compelling universal coverage. This initiative met with strong opposition from Hillary Clinton.[7]
In 1990, Cooper was one of only three House Democrats who voted against the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.[8] On several occasions, however, he found himself having to explain his votes to his somewhat conservative constituents.[citation needed]
In 2009 the Wall Street Journal wrote about Cooper's concerns about the national deficit. It's even worse than most people think, he says, because of dodgy accounting used by the federal government...'The U.S. government uses cash accounting,' he says. 'That is illegal for any enterprise of any size in America except for the U.S. government.'[9] He made similar remarks on PBS, saying that 'The real deficit in America is at least twice as large as any politician will tell you. And it may be ten times larger.'[10]
During his first period in Congress, he served on the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[6][11][12]
In 1994, Cooper ran for the Senate seat vacated by Al Gore's election to the Vice Presidency, but was soundly defeated by Republican attorney and actor Fred Thompson. Cooper received just under 40 percent of the vote. It was a bad year overall for Democrats in Tennessee, as Republican Bill Frist captured Tennessee's other Senate seat and Don Sundquist was elected governor. The 4th district seat was also won by a Republican, Van Hilleary, as the GOP gained a majority of the state's congressional delegation for only the second time since Reconstruction.
After losing his Senate bid, Cooper moved to Nashville and went into private business, also serving as a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management.
When Thompson opted not to run for a second full Senate term in 2002, 5th District Congressman Bob Clement (with whom Cooper had served from 1988 to 1995) ran for Thompson's seat. Cooper entered the Democratic primary along with several other prominent local Democrats. Having not won the 5th or its predecessors since 1874, Republicans had long since given up on it; the last serious GOP bid for the 5th had been in 1972. It was generally understood that whoever won the Democratic primary was all but assured of victory in November. Cooper won the primary with 44 percent of the vote, all but assuring his return to Congress after an eight-year absence. Cooper defeated his opponent in the general election by an overwhelming margin.
Cooper was re-elected in 2004 against a Republican who disavowed his party's national ticket.
In the 2006 election, Cooper faced Tom Kovach, the state public relations coordinator for the Constitution Party, who ran as a Republican since the Constitution Party did not have ballot access in Tennessee at the time. No one opposed Kovach for the Republican nomination. Cooper defeated Kovach by 41 points.
On Election Day 2008, Cooper defeated Republican John Gerard Donovan 68%-31%.[13]
Cooper defeated Republican David Hall 57%-42%.[14]
The 2010 midterm elections saw Republicans gain complete control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction. This led to speculation that the legislature might try to draw the 5th out from under Cooper. Indeed, in the summer of 2011 Cooper and Nashville Mayor Karl Dean told The Tennessean that they'd heard rumors about heavily Democratic Nashville being split between three Republican districts. Despite its large size, Nashville has been located entirely or mostly in a single district since Reconstruction. Cooper said he'd gotten his hands on a map that would have placed his home in Nashville into the heavily Republican 6th District. The 5th would have been reconfigured into a strongly Republican district stretching from Murfreesboro to the Alabama border, while the rest of Nashville would have been placed in the heavily Republican 7th District. Had it been implemented, the map would have left Cooper with only two realistic places to runan incumbent-versus-incumbent challenge in the 6th against freshman Republican Diane Black, or the reconfigured 5th, which had reportedly been drawn for State Senator and Murfreesboro resident Bill Ketron, chairman of the redistricting committee.[15] However, the final map was far less ambitious, and actually made the 5th slightly more Democratic than its predecessor. Notably, Cooper picked up all of Nashville.
Cooper defeated B. Staats 65%-33%.[16]
Cooper is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition and generally has a moderate voting record. Cooper is the only Tennessean on the Armed Services Committee. He also serves on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Despite the different policy affiliation, he became one of Barack Obama's earliest Congressional endorsers.[17] Cooper opposed an $819 billion economic stimulus plan that passed the House in 2009,[18] but ended up voting for the revised $787 billion final package.[19] He is one of only a few Blue Dog members that don't seek earmarks.[20][21] Cooper voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010.[22] In 2009 the Think Progress website reported that a Daily Kos poll ""found that 60 percent of his constituents disapprove of his handling of the health care issue.""[23]
A perception has arisen among some observers that the 5th could easily support a more liberal Democrat than Cooper due to the influx of culturally liberal white-collar workers in the music and publishing industries and the large number of colleges in the area. Although the 5th is only a marginally Democratic district on paper at D+5, more than two-thirds of its vote is cast in Nashville/Davidson County, which has double the population of the rest of the district combined. However, Cooper has seldom if ever faced any significant challenge to his ideological left, or even threats thereof, given the historical strength of the Davidson County organization. A more recent reason for Cooper's clout among voters, though, is the control of the state legislature by Republicans, who might divide the district in the future, or merely threaten to do so, to thwart any possibility of a nationally-aligned liberal taking the seat (see above). Those fears work strongly in Cooper's favor, in addition to his nearly lifelong connections with establishment figures in Tennessee, and will probably continue to do so in the near future.
In July 2011, Cooper was one of five Democrats to vote for the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act.[24]
In 2011, Rep. Cooper became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[25]
In 2012, Cooper authored the No Budget, No Pay Act which specifies that congressmen would not get paid unless they passed a budget by October 1, 2012.[26][27][28]
Cooper spoke with Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig about the subject of reforming Congress.[29] According to Lessig, Cooper explained that members of Congress were so preoccupied with the question of what they would do after leaving Congress  the most obvious career path being lobbying  that they fell into the habit of thinking about how to serve special interests rather than how to serve the public.[29] According to Lessig, Cooper described Congress as a ""Farm League for K Street"".[29][30]
In 2011, Cooper said: Working in this Congress is deeply frustrating; in fact, it's enraging. My colleagues are misbehaving. They're posturing for voters back home. They're taking the cheap political hit instead of studying the problem that's before us.[31] In the same year, Cooper called the partisan posturing over the debt ceiling 'an extremely dangerous game of chicken,' and said hed 'never seen politicians act more irresponsibly than they have been recently,' over the nations debt.[32]
In 1985 Cooper married Martha Bryan Hayes.[34] They have three children.[35] Cooper's daughter Mary was the Student Body President at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[36] Cooper's son Hayes attends Groton School, and his son Jamie attends The University of Georgia."

She became the first member of her family to earn a college degree [3] after graduating from Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Maryland with an associate's degree in nursing. She received a bachelor's degree in nursing in 1991 from Belmont University.[4][5]
Black worked as a Registered Nurse until she ran for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1998. Later she served as an educator at Volunteer State Community College[6][7] in Gallatin, Tennessee. [8]
Before becoming a state senator in 2004, she had previously served as a state representative for six years from 1998. Black was the Assistant Floor Leader of the Senate Republican Caucus, a member of the Senate Government Operations Committee, and the Vice-Chair of the Senate General Welfare, Health and Human Resources Committee. She was elected the Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus Chairman in 2006.[6]
In May 2009, Black's legislative aide forwarded an email depicting a collage of United States Presidents. President Barack Obama's section of the collage was represented by a black square with two eyeballs.[9] Black's reprimand of her aide was criticized as too lenient by two political blogs[10][11] and Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Chip Forrester.[12] Black said the email did not represent her views and that the reprimand of her aide was in keeping with the legislator's human resource policy for email guideline violations.[13]
Black is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who self-identifies as a ""congressman""; the others are Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.[14]
In December, 2009, she became a candidate for Tennessee's 6th congressional district to succeed Bart Gordon, who did not run for reelection.[15] Her biggest competition in the Republican primary came from former Rutherford County GOP chairwoman Lou Ann Zelenik and State Senator Jim Tracy. On August 5, 2010, Black won the Republican primary with 31% of the vote, over Zelenik and Tracy, who earned 30% each.[16] Brett Carter was nominated by the Democrats after well-known elected officials declined the candidacy, which resulted in CQ Politics rating this race as ""Safe Republican"".[17] In the November election, Black won with 67 percent of the vote.[citation needed]
In the 2012 general election, Black was a surrogate for Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[18] Black made appearances for Romney in Pennsylvania,[19] Wisconsin,[20] and in various cable news interviews.[21] Black has been a member of the following committees: Committee on the Budget, Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Tea Party Caucus and the Republican Study Committee.
In October 2013, Black introduced the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 3393; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to consolidate several different education tax incentives into an expanded American Opportunity Tax Credit.[22][23] The American Opportunity Tax Credit, under this legislation, would provide a maximum credit of $2,500.[24]
Black has received endorsements from Governor Sarah Palin, [25] The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB),[26] Governor Mitt Romney,[27] The National Rifle Association (NRA) [28] Congresswoman Michele Bachmann,[29] Former Congressman Alan West,[29] Tennessee Right to Life,[citation needed] Susan B. Anthony List,[30] and The U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[31]
Black's net worth is ""almost $29 million"" which includes $8.5 million in real estate and her husband's stake in Aegis Sciences Corporation.[32]

Born Marsha Wedgeworth in Laurel, Mississippi,[citation needed] she attended Mississippi State University, earning a B.S.[2] in home economics in 1973.[4][5] In college, she joined Chi Omega[2][3] and worked as a student manager for the Southwestern Company, selling books door-to-door.[4]
Blackburn's professional career began in 1973 when she was hired as a sales manager for Times Mirror, Inc. In 1975 she was named Director of Retail Fashion and Special Events of the Caster Knott Co. Division of Mercantile Stores, Inc. She held this position until 1978, when, she became the owner of Marketing Strategies, a promotion-event management and image consulting firm. She continues to run this business to this day.[5]
Blackburn was a founding member of the Williamson County Young Republicans.[3] She became chair of the Williamson County Republican Party[3] in 1989.[4] In 1992, she was a candidate for Congress and a delegate to the 1992 Republican National Convention.[4] She lost the congressional race,[3] but remained active in politics.[4] Blackburn was appointed executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission in 1995 by Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist[3] and held that post through 1997.[4] In 1998, she was elected to the Tennessee State Senate[2] where she served for six years and rose to be minority whip.[4]
In 2000, she took part in the effort to prevent the passage of a state income tax championed by Sundquist[3] and to ask for accountability for spending increases related to TennCare.
Blackburn is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a ""congressman""; the others are Republicans Diane Black of Tennessee and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.[6]
In 2002, Republican Ed Bryant gave up his seat as Representative from Tennessee's 7th District so that he could run for the Senate. Blackburn ran against Democrat Tim Barron for the seat and was overwhelmingly elected, thus becoming the first woman in Tennessee history to be elected to Congress without following her husband.[citation needed] In 2004 she ran unopposed and was re-elected.
In 2006, she successfully ran for a third term in the House of Representatives.[2] In November 2007, she ran for the position of Republican Conference chair, but lost.[6][7][8] She joined Mitt Romney's presidential campaign as a senior advisor.[9] In May 2007, she resigned her position in the Romney campaign and endorsed former U.S. senator Fred Thompson for president.[10][11][12] She was re-elected in 2008, 2010 and 2012; garnering no Democratic Party challenger in 2012.
Blackburn has been a member of the following committees:
She was also a member of the following caucuses:
She served as an assistant whip in the 108th and 109th Congress, and served as a deputy whip for the 110th and 111th Congress.[13][14] During the 110th Congress she was the communications chair for the Republican Study Committee. She served as a member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee for a third consecutive term.[citation needed] In 2008, she won her primary race by gaining 62 percent of the vote against Shelby County registrar of deeds, and former fellow state senator Tom Leatherwood.[15][16]
Though serving a national role as Vice Chair of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Blackburn does not currently accept emails from outside of Tennessee's 7th congressional district.
Redistricting after the 2000 Census moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District. The 6th District Democratic incumbent Congressman, Bart Gordon, had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.[17] To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by Wesberry v. Sanders  1964) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of Clarksville to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wideroughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to Memphis Magazine, the gerrymandered district ""stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville"".[3]
In 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman Ed Bryant decided to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Fred Thompson. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or ""Dixiecratic,"" to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as Civil Rights and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of school prayer, as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like Mississippi and Alabama. Despite the heavy presence of African Americans in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.
Of the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was tantamount to election in November. In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron. She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. (Irene Bailey Baker and Louise Reece had served as caretakers after their husbands died in office, and Marilyn Lloyd replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.) She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since Reconstruction. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.
She ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. Washingtonian's September 2004 ""Best and Worst of Congress"", obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members. She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition. Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.
Blackburn is a fiscal and social conservative. She opposed the Affordable Care Act, stating that with the passage of the bill, ""freedom dies a little bit today.""[18] She subsequently supported efforts to repeal the legislation, arguing that it ""means well"" but fails to live up to its promise.[19] When pressed by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on the claim that the legislation included ""death panels"" for the elderly, she would not reject this assertion.[20][21]
In April 2009, she questioned former Vice President Al Gore during an energy-related congressional hearing: ""The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?.[22] The Independent, a London-based periodical, has credited her for ""famously put[ting Gore] on the spot about his business interests in the [energy] industry"" during this confrontation.[23] Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, pointing out that every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to a non-profit.[24]
In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans which would criminalize all abortions after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.[25] She replaced the bill's sponsor, congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), after Franks made controversial claims that the chances of pregnancy resulting from rape were ""very low"".[26][27]
At October 2013 congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ""Obamacare"", Blackburn charged that the health.gov website violated HIPAA and health information privacy rights. The next day, when a CNN interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question that the web site asks is ""do you smoke?"", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.[28]
She scored 100% on American Conservative Unions 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009 Ratings of Congress.[29][30][31] According to her campaign website, National Journal described her as a ""freshman to watch"" and a ""top House conservative"" in 2003 and 2004, Americans for Tax Reform called her a ""taxpayer hero"" in 2003, and the National Right to Life praised her for supporting the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.[citation needed] In 2008, Blackburn was named one of the ""Most Corrupt Members of Congress"" by the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington,[32] although the Federal Election Commission unanimously rejected CREW's complaint.[33]
On February 16, 2014, Blackburn appeared on MSNBC's Meet The Press as a guest in a climate change segment alongside Bill Nye. She reiterated a belief that scientists do not sufficiently understand the climate to make long term predictions, and argued that a cost/benefit analysis did not support taking any action against further carbon emission increases.[34]
She is a staunch opponent of Net neutrality in the United States and municipal broadband initiatives. As of March 2015 her campaign has accepted at least $221,900 from contributors in the telecommunications industry. These include AT&T and Comcast who have strongly lobbied against net neutrality.[35][36][37]
In April 2008, Blackburn summoned reporters to explain that she had found errors in her Federal Election Commission filings going back several years and had failed to report $286,278 in expenditures, including $18,821 to a fundraising consulting company run by her son-in-law, Paul Ketchel. She also failed to report $102,044 in contributions.[38]
*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, write-ins received 10 votes.
Blackburn is married to Chuck Blackburn,[3] and they live in Brentwood, a suburb of Nashville in Williamson County.[41] The couple have two children.[3] Her husband is the founder of the International Bow Tie Society (IBTS).[42] She is Presbyterian[2] and her church, Christ Presbyterian Church,[2] is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in America.[43][44] She is a member of The C Street Family, a prayer group that includes members of Congress.[45] She is also a member of the Smithsonian Libraries Advisory Board.[46]"
"359","","2011","1973","Tennessee 8","","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fincher","Stephen Fincher","Republican","farmer","United Methodist","Stephen Lee Fincher (born February 7, 1973) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Tennessee's 8th congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. The seat was vacated by retiring Democratic incumbent John S. Tanner in 2010, and Fincher defeated Democratic Tennessee state senator Roy Herron in the 2010 mid-term Congressional election.[2] Fincher is currently serving his second term after being reelected in 2012. He was elected to a third term in 2014.


Fincher was born in 1973 in Memphis.[3] When he was 9 years old, he joined the Fincher Family singing ministry, a gospel group led by his grandmother that travels to county fairs throughout the 8th district. They perform at more than 100 events each year.[4] Fincher graduated from Crockett County High School in Alamo.[5]
A seventh generation farmer, Fincher is a managing partner in Fincher Farms, a family business that grows cotton, corn, soybeans, and wheat on more than 2,500 acres in western Tennessee. The company has received $8.9 million in farm subsidies over the past decade, mostly from the cotton program, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.[6][7][8] Fincher received a $13,650 grant to help buy grain hauling and storage equipment from the state Department of Agriculture in 2009 as part of the Tennessee Agricultural Enhancement Program.[9] Fincher has received over $3.5 million from federal subsidies over the years, mostly for cotton farming.[10]
Fincher announced his candidacy for the 8th District before 11-term Democratic incumbent John S. Tanner announced his retirement. He won the August primary largely as a result of high voter turnout in rural areas of the district.[11]
In the general election, Fincher faced Democratic State Senator Roy Herron, Tea Party candidate Donn Janes, who earlier dropped out of the Republican primary, and Independent Mark J. Rawles. Fincher declined to participate in a series of public debates.[12][13][14] Fincher was criticized by Herron and local media for his decision to not disclose his income tax returns, calling the criticism a ""witch hunt.""[15][16] Fincher stated: ""There is no reason for me to disclose my tax returns. These attacks are because Herron is losing and he can't handle it. He is avoiding the issues.""[17]
He received endorsements from former Governor Winfield Dunn, Citizens United, Eagle Forum, Family Research Council, Concerned Women for America, and State Senator Dolores Gresham.[18] Fincher had over $420,000 cash on hand. Herron had over $1.1 million cash on hand.[19]
The 8th had historically been represented by ""Yellow Dog"" Democrats. Most state and local officials are Democrats, and congressional elections usually saw Democrats skate to reelection. However, it has become increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level since the turn of the 21st century. In the 2008 presidential election, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain carried the district with 56% of the vote.[20]
On November 2, 2010, Fincher defeated Herron, receiving 98,484 votes to Herron's 64,701, or approximately 60% of the vote. Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2011, Fincher became the first Republican to represent what is now the 8th District since 1898.[citation needed]
Fincher's seat was made considerably safer after the 2010 census. He lost his share of Clarksville while picking up some heavily Republican territory east of Memphis which had previously been in the 7th District. This turned the 8th into one of the most Republican districts in the nation; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+19, it is the 11th most Republican district in the South.
On paper, this left Fincher vulnerable to a primary challenge from a Memphis-area Republican. However, he won the Republican primary with 86% of the vote over Annette Justice, a youth worker from Dyersburg. He then defeated Democrat Timothy Dixon in the general election with 68% of the vote.
On November 4, 2014, Fincher was elected to a third term by his widest margin, securing approximately 73% of the vote.
Fincher is a fiscal and social conservative, who at the same time benefits from government farm subsidies. He is strongly pro-life and pro-gun, and opposes same-sex marriage. On the issues section of his Website, he lists his top priority as restoring ""limited government."" He does not consider himself a traditional politician; his slogan in 2010 was ""My roots are in Tennessee, not in politics.""[21]
In September 2011, Fincher was named one of the ""Most Corrupt Members of Congress"" for 2011 by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, specifically citing the Gates Banking loan.[22]
In 2012, Fincher received the largest election contribution from the NRA; more than any US Senator or Representative.[23]
In May 2013, Fincher argued for large cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program along with his House Republican colleagues. Fincher, who owns a farm, has received over $3.5 million in agricultural subsidies from the federal government. Critics accused Fincher of hypocrisy.[24][25][26] Fincher voted to cut farm subsidies (also known as direct payments) in this year's Farm Bill, the first Farm Bill he has voted on while in Congress.[27][28]
The following is an incomplete list of bills sponsored by Fincher during his tenure as a Congressperson.
In October 2010, the Federal Election Commission announced that it was conducting an investigation into a $250,000 loan the Gates Banking and Trust Company, where Fincher's father is a board member,[31] made to Fincher that he did not disclose on his FEC filings.[32] Initially, Fincher's FEC filing indicated that the loan to the campaign committee came from the candidates personal funds with no reference to a bank loan. On December 6, 2010, the campaign amended the filing.[33]
Fincher and his wife, Lynn, have three children. They live in Frog Jump, Crockett County, Tennessee.[citation needed]"

University of Memphis","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen","Steve Cohen","Democratic","Tennessee Senate, Attorney","Jewish","Stephen Ira ""Steve"" Cohen (born May 24, 1949) is the U.S. Representative for Tennessee's 9th congressional district, serving since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Tennessee's 9th district includes almost three-fourths of Memphis. Cohen is Tennessee's first Jewish congressman.[1]


Cohen was born in Memphis, Tennessee on May 24, 1949, the son of Genevieve (ne Goldsand) and pediatrician Morris David Cohen. He has two older brothers, Michael Corey and Martin D. Cohen.[2][3] He is a fourth-generation Memphian,[4] and is a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Poland.[5] His immigrant grandfather owned a newsstand.[6] Cohen contracted polio when he was five, and the disease caused him to shift his attention from sports to politics at an early age.[4] When Cohen was eleven, John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop in Memphis, and Cohen took a picture of Kennedy sitting on a convertible. Cohen describes Kennedy as his political hero; the picture still hangs in his office.[6] In 1961, Cohens family moved to Coral Gables, Florida where his father took a residency in psychiatry at the University of Miami. From 1964 to 1966, the Cohen family resided in Pasadena, California where Dr. Cohen completed a fellowship in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Southern California. Cohen, who attended Polytechnic School, returned to Florida in 1966 to graduate from Coral Gables High School before returning to Memphis where his father established his private psychiatry practice.
Cohen graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1973, he graduated from the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law of Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) with a Juris Doctor.[2] From 1978-2006, Cohen was the sole practitioner of his own law firm, practicing civil and criminal law until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives.
While serving for three years as Legal Advisor for the Memphis Police Department, Cohen rose to political prominence when he was elected to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention of 1977 at the age of 27. The Convention elected him its vice president.[7] Cohen was then elected to serve as a commissioner on the Shelby County Commission, an office he held from 1978 to 1980.[2] During his time at the Commission, Cohen was instrumental in the creation of The Med, a community-funded regional hospital.[7] In 1980, Cohen served as an interim Shelby County General Sessions Court judge.[2] He has also served as a delegate to the 1980, 1992, 2004, and 2008 Democratic National Conventions.[2]
Cohen was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1982, representing District 30, which includes parts of Memphis. He held that position for 24 years.[2]
For 18 years, Cohen strove to repeal the ban on lotteries in the Tennessee State Constitution.[7] His efforts were successful in 2002, and a state lottery program designed to provide college scholarships for Tennessee students was adopted the following year.[7] The lottery program is regarded as the most well-known accomplishment of Cohen's Senate career, having raised over $2 billion for scholarships, afterschool programs, pre-K, technical center grants, and energy saving capital programs in K-12 schools as of 2012.[7] Cohen also sponsored legislation relating to expansion of community access to healthcare, the protection of animal rights, the reinstatement of voting rights, graduated driver licenses, and funding for the arts during his career.[7] He sponsored the T-Bo law, the nation's first-ever statute providing for damages up to $5000 in cases of intentional or negligent acts resulting in the death of a companion dog or cat.[8] He has won four awards from the Humane Society as of 2012.
He sponsored and passed legislation providing funding for the construction of the Autozone Park baseball stadium, creating the Holocaust Commission, and providing permanent funding for the arts with Tennesseans for the Arts license plates. He was awarded the Bill of Rights Award from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Bird Dog Award for Ethics from Tennessee Common Cause in 1992.
In March 2005, Cohen was one of three Tennessee Senators to vote against the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment, which Tennessee voters approved via a referendum in November 2006.[9] During the course of the debate on the amendment, Cohen offered several amendments to the amendment, all of which failed, including the proposed addition of an ""adultery clause,"" which said ""Adultery is deemed to be a threat to the institution of marriage and contrary to public policy in Tennessee.""[10] Cohen won the Political Leadership Award from the Human Rights Campaign.
Cohen was widely regarded as one of the Senate's toughest and most articulate debaters, as he has an unusually straightforward and direct style when compared to other Southern politicians. One Tennessee writer described him as ""very outspoken, very persistent, and a lot more cerebral than most of his colleagues.""[6]
When elected in 1982, Cohen was the first Jewish member to serve in the Tennessee Senate since 1958.[6]
In 1996, Cohen ran for election to the United States House of Representatives seat for the 9th District, which came open when 22-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Harold Ford, Sr. announced his retirement. The then 26-year-old Harold Ford, Jr., the incumbent's son, was his opponent in the Democratic primary.[6] Reflecting on the race, Cohen said, ""I'd spent fourteen years in the [state] Senate, had the experience, and didn't like the idea of [the seat] being handed down like an heirloom.""[6]
Cohen lost the primary to Ford by 25 points.[7] Noting that Ford, an African-American, did much better than Cohen in majority black precincts despite Ford's inexperience, Cohen said, ""It is impossible for a person who is not African American to get a large vote in the African American community... against a substantial candidate. The fact is, I am white, and it doesn't seem to matter what you do.""[6] Later, Cohen admitted that his statement was ""impolitic"" but also noted that ""race is still an important factor in voting.""[6]
Cohen was able to return to the State Senate after the election. Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Cohen did not have to run for reelection to the Senate until 1998.
In early April 2006, Cohen announced that he was again running for the 9th District seat; Ford, Jr. was not running for reelection. Cohen was the first candidate in the race with significant name recognition outside the Memphis area but had fourteen opponents in the primary.[7] The Commercial Appeal, Memphis' daily newspaper, endorsed Cohen in the race.[11] The crowded nature of the primary was largely due to the district's demographics. The 9th is a heavily Democratic, black-majority district, and it was considered very likely that whoever won the Democratic primary would be the district's next congressman.
Cohen won the August 3 primary by a decisive 4,000-vote margin despite being outspent 2 to 1 by the runner-up in the primary. In fact, six Democrats raised more money than he did.[12] He carried many of the district's predominantly black precincts by healthy margins. He faced Republican Mark White and independent Jake Ford (the younger brother of Harold Ford, Jr.) in the general election in November.[13]
Though the Ninth District is heavily Democratic, Jake Ford was seen as a serious contender for the race because of his significant name recognition among Memphis' black voters.[6] Jake Ford had skipped the Democratic primary because he felt it was too crowded, but stated he would caucus with the Democrats if elected. The Ford family has been a significant force in Memphis' black community since the days of E.H. Crump. Indeed, it seemed that the real race was between Cohen and Jake Ford. White was not a serious factor, and would have faced nearly impossible odds even in a two-way race with Cohen.
Cohen was endorsed by the mayor of Memphis, W. W. Herenton, and the mayor of Shelby County, A.C. Wharton, both of whom are black and members of the Democratic Party.[14] He was also endorsed by many local Democratic activists who had long felt Harold Ford, Jr. was too moderate.
However, many of the city's politically influential black pastors refused to support Cohen, and the area Black Ministers Association overwhelmingly voted to endorse Jake Ford. The Ford family itself was split. While Harold Ford, Jr. himself remained neutral (despite rumors of collusion between the two brothers' campaigns), their cousin Joe Ford, Jr., an entertainment lawyer, strongly endorsed Cohen after finishing third in the primary. However, Harold Ford, Sr. strongly supported his younger son.[15]
On October 8, 2006, Cohen, Ford, and White participated in a televised debate in Memphis. Among other topics, issues discussed included Iraq, medical marijuana, education, and the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment.[16] Ford attacked Cohen's record in the State Senate, including his opposition to the Marriage Protection Amendment, support for medical marijuana, and his voting attendance record.[16] Cohen responded by standing by his public record, pointing out Ford's lack of experience in public office, and indicating that Ford had been to jail and had dropped out of high school.[16]
Cohen won the election by a decisive margin, winning 60% of the vote to Ford's 22% and White's 18%.[17] Sixty percent of the votes received by Cohen were from African-American voters.
Despite Cohen's strong performance in the black community, many of the city's politically active blacks felt chagrined at being represented by him. Besides some sentiment that the 9th should be represented by a black Democrat, his socially liberal views (see below) also gave them pause. For example, Cohen's support for a hate-crimes bill drew particularly strong opposition from most of the city's black ministers because it included a sexual orientation provision. Cohen contends that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, and Harold Ford, Jr. had voted for it in the previous Congress. Still, many of the city's black ministers tried to rally behind a consensus black candidate to challenge Cohen in the Democratic primary.[18]
Cohen faced four challengers in the August 7, 2008 Democratic primary for the 9th District. His major opponent was Nikki Tinker, a lawyer who had finished second to Cohen in the 2006 primary[19] and had formerly been an aide to Harold Ford, Jr.[20] Tinker received the endorsement of the city's Black Ministerial Association.
At a June 2008 campaign event, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Cohen as ""the conscience of the freshman class"", adding He is a progressive and an important member of the Transportation Committee, which provides the infrastructure for jobs that will make America more competitive in the global economy. [21]
The campaign quickly turned ugly, with Tinker putting together a raft of negative ads. One attacked Cohen for voting against a proposal that would have removed a statue and the remains of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate lieutenant-general who was involved in the founding of the Ku Klux Klan,[22] from the Medical Center park. The ad falsely implied that Cohen had ties to the Klan by juxtaposing Cohen with a white-clad Klansman.[23] Another ad accused Cohen of ""praying in our churches"" [24] while voting against school prayer during his tenure in the State Senate. Tinker's campaign later removed the ads from its YouTube account amid criticism from a number of sources.
On the day the Primary was held, Barack Obama denounced Tinker's ads, saying they ""have no place in our politics, and will do nothing to help the good people of Tennessee."" Harold Ford, Jr. also denounced the ads.[25]
The primary had been marred by racial tensions for months prior to the August vote. In February 2008, Rev. George Brooks, a Tinker supporter, distributed literature in the district which stated that ""Cohen and the Jews HATE Jesus"" and urged the defeat of an ""opponent of Christ and Christianity."" Another minister, Rev. Robert Poindexter of Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, said that he was supporting Tinker because Cohen ""(is) not black, and he can't represent me, that's just the bottom line.""

Ultimately, Cohen won the primary in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Tinker's 19 percent. In his victory speech, Cohen said his victory proved ""Memphis has come a long, long way"" from its racially divisive past.[25] Cohen's primary win virtually assured him of a second term; no Republican even filed, and any Republican challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds in any case. He was reelected with 87.9 percent of the vote against three independent challengers, one of whom was Jake Ford (who won 4.8 percent of the vote).
Cohen endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary on February 4, 2008, the day before the Super Tuesday primaries.[27] On September 10, 2008 while speaking on the floor of the House, Cohen compared Obama's work as a community organizer to Jesus' work.[28]
Former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton announced that he would challenge Cohen in the 2010 Democratic primary for the seat. In a guest column in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Herenton wrote that while he hoped the campaign would focus on issues rather than race or religion, that ""it remains a fact that the 9th Congressional District provides the only real opportunity to elect a qualified African-American to the all-white 11-member delegation representing Tennessee in Washington."" Herenton also denied having supported Cohen in his 2006 bid against Jake Ford, writing ""I did not support Steve Cohen the individual for the 9th Congressional District. I supported an idea that was bigger than him as an individual. I supported the principle of fairness.""[29] During the 2006 campaign, Herenton endorsed Cohen, saying ""Steve Cohen is the best-qualified candidate for this leadership role"".[30] While Cohen's commanding win in the 2008 primary suggested that he has won strong support among the district's African-American community, Herenton was easily his highest-profile opponent to date.
In September 2009, Herenton drew controversy when he stated in a radio interview that Cohen ""really does not think very much of African-Americans"" and that ""[Cohen]s played the black community well. In addition, Herenton's campaign manager Sidney Chism told the New York Times that the Memphis-area congressional seat Cohen holds ""was set aside for people who look like me. It wasn't set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation."" The National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) criticized Herenton for these remarks, stating that he comments were ""unacceptable in a Democratic primary or anywhere in our political discourse.""[31][32]
President Obama endorsed Congressman Cohen for re-election, saying Congressman Cohen is a proven leader in the United States Congress and a strong voice for Tennessee. Together, we passed historic health care reform and together were continuing the fight to renew our economy and bring jobs back to the American people. I am proud to stand with Steve and support his re-election to Congress.""
In the unofficial election results, Steve Cohen won 79% of the vote to Herenton's 21%. The vote marked the first time Herenton, 70, elected to a record five terms as mayor, lost a race for public office.[33] This all but assured Cohen of a third term. In the general election, Cohen easily dispatched Republican challenger Charlotte Bergmann, taking 74 percent of the vote to Bergmann's 25 percent.
Cohen was challenged in the Democratic Primary by Tomeka Hart, a female African-American member of the Memphis School Board and Memphis Urban League President who was undefeated in elections up to that point. Cohen won the Democratic Primary with 89.2% of the vote on August 2, 2012[34]the highest vote total in the district in recent history and the highest percentage vote for a white candidate running for office in a majority African-American district in history.
President Obama endorsed Cohen on April 5, 2012, saying Congressman Steve Cohen has worked with me on jobs bills, health care, and other issues of importance to the middle class. He also never fails to pitch me on the city of Memphis, whether its Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis basketball, or barbecue. I urge you to vote for Steve Cohen, a tireless advocate for the 9th District"".[35] In the general election, Cohen trounced Republican businessman George Flinn with 75 percent of the vote.
Cohen was challenged in the Democratic Primary by prominent African American Attorney Ricky Wilkins. Cohen defeated Wilkins.

In spite of Cohen's feelings against those plaintiff's attorneys, he spoke against the bill.[41][42]
Cohen has said that he believes that adequate health care is a ""fundamental right"" of all citizens.[43] Cohen supports gender equality, progressive taxation, medicinal use of marijuana, decriminalization of Marijuana, gun rights and capital punishment.

He supports limiting campaign donations and disclosure of amounts coming from lobbyists.[36]
During his first month in Congress, Cohen supported the ""100-Hour Plan"" in the House, which included raising the federal minimum wage, requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower Medicare prescription drug prices, and reducing interest rates for student borrowers. Cohen also cosponsored House Concurrent Resolution 23, which ""[expresses] the sense of Congress that the President should not order an escalation in the total number of members of the United States Armed Forces serving in Iraq.""[45]
On February 27, 2007, Cohen introduced a resolution in the House that apologizes for African-American slavery and the system of Jim Crow laws that persisted for 100 years after the abolition of slavery. Cohen noted that no president has officially apologized for allowing slavery. The bill had 36 cosponsors.[46] The resolution passed on July 29, 2008, marking the first time a branch of the federal government had officially apologized for the institution of slavery and its aftermath.[47] Cohen was honored with the D. Emelio Castelar Work Recognition Award by the Vida Foundation in Madrid, Spain for his work on the slavery apology bill and served as the keynote speaker for their international symposium on the abolition of slavery and the slave trade.[48]
Cohen supported the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act (H.R. 2919; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) to prepare a report each year on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded by federal courts to nonfederal entities when they prevail in a case against the United States.[49] Cohen, an original co-sponsor of the bill, argued that ""Americans have a right to know what their government is doing and their government has a duty to be as transparent as possible.""[50]
Cohen received the American Bar Association's Day Award along with Congressman John Lewis (GA-5), Senator Olympia Snowe (ME) and Senator Richard Lugar (IN).

Cohen dedicated the award to Dr. Benjamin Hooks and Dr. Dorothy Height during his acceptance speech.[51]
Cohen sponsored the SPEECH Act banning the practice of libel tourism, rendering libel lawsuits unenforceable if the judgments were issued in a nation where the legal standard for libel is set lower than our own. The Senate Sponsor was Senator Patrick Leahy. The bill passed both houses of Congress in July 2010 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama the following month.[52]

He opposed Republican policy regarding the War in Iraq.[54]
Cohen made a trip to Iraq from October 4, 2007 to October 7, 2007 as part of a congressional fact-finding delegation. Cohen noted that his impression was that the country was ""not in very good shape"" and that its economy has been ""ravaged."" Cohen met with soldiers who complained that long deployments are causing divorces. When Cohen raised this concern with General David Petraeus, Petraeus told Cohen that the claims were being exaggerated. After meeting with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Cohen described him as ""overly optimistic,"" noting his ""bizarre"" statement that sectarian war in Iraq is over.[55]
In 2012, Cohen sponsored the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund has been plagued with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When another member of the House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied The truth of the matter is that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so its good enough to bring them home permanently. The Amendment passed 228-191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.[56]
Cohen sponsored and co-authored, along with Congressman J. Randy Forbes (R-VA-4), Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA-46), Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-9), and Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY-8) The National Guard & Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act, which allows qualifying members of the National Guard and reservists to bypass the often onerous means testing required under current bankruptcy law if their financial hardships were caused by deployment. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2011.[57]
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi assigned Cohen to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, which was Cohen's first choice for a committee assignment, as well as the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.[58]
As there are no Democratic U.S. Senators from Tennessee, President Barack Obama asked Cohen to recommend judicial nominees. Cohen recommended Judge Bernice Donald for United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, and Judge John Fowlkes for District Court Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. Both have been confirmed by the United States Senate.
Cohen recommended Ed Stanton III to President Barack Obama as U.S. Attorney for Tennessee's Western District. Stanton was confirmed in August 2010.
Steve Cohen has sponsored 16 bills since Jan 4, 2007, of which 13 haven't made it out of committee and 2 were successfully enacted. Cohen has co-sponsored 762 bills during the same time period.[59]
Cohen announced in 2012 that Memphis is to be awarded a $15 million TIGER IV Grant for the Main Street to Main Street Multi-Modal Connector Project. The project will add a dedicated sidewalk to the Harahan Bridge connecting Tennessee to Arkansas, allowing people to walk, run, or bicycle over the Mississippi River. The project has drawn praise from many in the business community, including FedEx founder Fred Smith.[60]
Cohen was appointed to the Helsinki Commission by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2011. Congressman Steve Cohen is a leader in promoting civil rights and opportunity of all Americans, and he brings this same passion to the promotion of human rights and democracy around the world, Pelosi said. ""The Helsinki Commission is a focal point for security and cooperation among nations and leaders, and Congressman Cohens voice is sure to strengthen and advance the commissions work.[61]
Although his family has no knowledge of any Turkish heritage, Cohen's mother's birth certificate states his maternal grandfather was born in Turkey when it was part of the Ottoman Empire. He is a member of the Congressional Caucus on US Turkish Relations and Turkish Americans.[62] He has consistently opposed Congressional recognition of the Armenian Genocide on pragmatic grounds, believing that recognizing it officially in Congress would damage relations with Turkey.[63]
On August 6, 2008, one day before the August 7, 2008 Democratic Congressional Primary, a confrontation between California-based documentary filmmaker Peter Musurlian and Cohen erupted. During a press conference at Cohen's home, Musurlian was asked to leave by Cohen's staff and Cohen himself. Cohen then put both hands on Musurlian's arms and forced him out of the home after Musurlian refused to leave.[64][65]
In a speech on the House floor on January 18, 2011, Cohen said of the Republican effort to repeal the Obama administration's health care reform law:
They say it's a government takeover of health care, a big lie just like Goebbels. You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's the same kind of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. You tell a lie over and over again. And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.[66]
According to Cohen's hometown paper, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, he was ""accused of upsetting the newfound atmosphere of civility in the House"" following the assassination attempt on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.[67] Republicans,[68] as well as many in the media and in the Jewish community, expressed outrage and demanded that Democrats condemn Cohen's comment. Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that ""someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric.""[69] His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that ""invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptableon either side of the aisle. Cohens comments and similar comments made by others are not helpful as our leaders and citizens conduct a joint effort to advance civility in our political discourse. We implore Cohen and all our leaders to choose their words carefully as we move forward.""[69]
In response to the controversy, Cohen said ""I said Goebbels lied about the Jews, and that led to the Holocaust. Not in any way whatsoever was I comparing Republicans to Nazis. I was saying lies are wrong.""[68]
Cohen later expressed regret for his remarks:
I would certainly never do anything to diminish the horror of the Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people. I sponsored legislation which created one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America and actively served as a Commission member for over 20 years. I regret that anyone in the Jewish Community, my Republican colleagues or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which is has been delivered.[69]
Cohen has been interviewed on The Colbert Report and is a frequent guest on MSNBC's Up with Chris Hayes and Current TV's The Young Turks. He has also appeared on Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura in which he was confronted by Ventura for co-sponsoring H.R. 645 which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers, otherwise known as Federal Emergency Management Agency camp facilities, on military installations.
Cohen became the subject of media attention when during the 2013 State of the Union address he accidentally publicly tweeted at model Victoria Brink, pleased u r watching. ilu, and then deleted the tweet.[70] He later explained to reporters that Brink was his daughter and that he had only learned of her three years prior. In July 2013, CNN facilitated a DNA test with Cohen, Brink, and the man who raised her, John Brink. The test revealed that John Brink was in fact the father of Victoria. Cohen said in a statement ""I was stunned and dismayed.""[71]"

Baylor University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Gohmert","Louie Gohmert","Republican","Texas appeals court judge","Baptist - SBC","Louis Buller ""Louie"" Gohmert, Jr. (born August 18, 1953) is an American politician and current Republican U.S. Representative from Texas's First Congressional District. On January 4, 2015, Gohmert announced he would challenge John Boehner for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was later defeated in the challenge by Boehner on January 6, 2015.[3]


Gohmert was born in Pittsburg, Texas, the son of Erma Sue (ne Brooks) and Louis Buller Gohmert. He is of German descent on his father's side.[4][5] Gohmert was raised in Mount Pleasant, Texas, where he graduated from the local high school in 1971.[6] He then enrolled in Texas A&M University, receiving his B.A. in history in 1975.[7]
Gohmert spent a summer as an exchange student in Ukraine.[8] He received a U.S. Army scholarship while at Texas A&M, where he was a brigade commander of the Corps of Cadets and class president.[9] He later received a law degree (Juris Doctor) from Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas in 1977, where he was also class president.[10]
Gohmert served in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, at Fort Benning, Georgia, from 1978 to 1982.[11] The majority of his legal service in the U.S. Army was as a defense attorney.
Gohmert was elected as a state district judge for Texas's 7th Judicial District, serving Smith County (Tyler, Texas) from 1992 to 2002. He was elected to three terms.[11] He first saw national recognition for a 1996 probation requirement where he ordered an H.I.V. positive man, who was convicted on motor vehicle theft charges, to seek the written consent from all future sexual partners on a court provided form notifying them of his H.I.V. status.[12] The judicial order angered LGBT activists and civil libertarians.[13] In 2002, Gohmert was appointed by Texas Governor Rick Perry to fill a vacancy as Chief Justice on Texas's 12th Court of Appeals, where he served a six-month term that ended in 2003.[10]
A mid-decade redistricting made the 1st District significantly more Republican than its predecessor, and also moved Gohmert's home in Tyler from the 4th to the 1st. In the 2004 Republican primary, Gohmert defeated State Representative Wayne Christian of Center. Gohmert then defeated Democratic incumbent 1st District Congressman Max Sandlin with 61 percent of the vote to Sandlin's 39 percent, becoming the first Republican since Reconstruction to represent northeast Texas. Gohmert has been easily elected six times. In 2006, he won his second term by defeating Democrat Roger L. Owen, a swimming pool builder from Hallsville, Texas. He faced no major party opposition in 2008 and 2010.[citation needed]
In November 2012, Gohmert was elected to his fifth term with 182,621 votes (71.7 percent) to Democrat Shirley J. McKellar's 67,758 (26.6 percent).[14]
In 2007 Gohmert said, ""I would submit to you that Washington, D.C. is also the only city in the entire country that every Senator and every Member of Congress has a vested interest in seeing that it works properly, that water works, sewer works, and no other city in America has that.""[15] When residents began calling Gohmert's office complaining about issues like trash and parking, he told them to speak to local government officials instead.[16] Washington, D.C. has been described as a modern example of virtual representation, although it has no voting representatives in Congress.[citation needed]
On July 29, 2009, Gohmert signed on as a co-sponsor of the defeated H.R. 1503. This bill would have amended ""the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the principal campaign committee of a candidate for election to the office of president to include with the committee's statement of organization a copy of the candidate's birth certificate, together with such other documentation as may be necessary to establish that the candidate meets the qualifications for eligibility to the office of president under the Constitution"".[17]
Gohmert stated in a House Judiciary Hearing on May 15, 2013, that he believed the FBI did not act with due diligence concerning alleged bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. His contention was that the FBI was more interested in Christian groups such as those led by Billy and Franklin Graham than in groups that might be considered less politically correct to target. Attorney General Eric Holder responded to his claims: ""The only observation I was going to make is that you state as a matter of fact what the FBI did and did not do. Unless somebody has done something inappropriate, you don't have access to the FBI files ... I know what the FBI did. You cannot know what I know. That's all"". Gohmert objected to this on the grounds that Holder had ""challenge[d]"" his character and made several unsuccessful attempts to inject his viewpoint as a point of personal privilege.[18]
On January 3, 2013, Gohmert broke ranks with the House leadership to nominate outspoken Florida Representative Allen West for Speaker of the House, although West narrowly lost his bid for re-election in November 2012, and was no longer a member of Congress.[19]
Although he has previously ruled out the possibility of a bid for the U.S. Senate, he has recently been boosted by at least one ""tea party"" group (Grassroots America We the People) as a primary challenger to current Republican Senator John Cornyn.[20]
On January 4, 2015, Gohmert announced he would formally challenge Speaker John Boehner for the Speaker of the House position. He announced the move on Fox & Friends Weekend.[21]
Gohmert has signed the Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[22] He offered an alternative plan to kick-start the economy with his tax holiday bill that would allow taxpayers to be exempt for two months from having federal income tax taken out of their paychecks.[23] He was one of a number of Republicans who voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011 on grounds it did not do enough to deal with the government's growing debt.[24]
Gohmert was one of four Republicans who voted against, joining 161 Democrats to oppose a balanced budget Constitutional amendment in November 2011.[25]
Gohmert does not believe in man made climate change, and has asserted that data supporting the theory is fraudulent. He opposes cap-and-trade legislation, such as the one that was passed in the US House when it was Democratic controlled, and supports expanding drilling, and exploration and drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).[26]
In a 2012 meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee, Gohmert stated his strong support of a trans-Alaskan pipeline, as a means for caribou to have more sex.[27][28][29]
According to Gohmert, ""When [the caribou] want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline. So [his] real concern now [is] ... if oil stops running through the pipeline ... do we need a study to see how adversely the caribou would be affected if that warm oil ever quit flowing? Gohmert's comments were not favorably received by the rest of the committee.[30][31]
Gohmert has stated his support for and voted for legislation in favor of school vouchers.[32]
Gohmert strongly supported the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress), a bill that would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in CBO's baseline.[33] Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current years appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward.[33] Gohmert said that ""conservatives have advocated for years that there should be no automatic spending increases in any federal department's budget... that has been a trap so when we simply slow the rate of increase, we are accused of making draconian cuts.""[34] He argued that this legislation would make clearer ""what is an increase and what is a cut"", put the government in the same situation as American families (who do not get automatic increases), and help with the task of getting the debt under control.[34]
Gohmert has a pro-life voting record. He has stated that he believes that life begins at conception. Gohmert sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act. Gohmert voted for the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, a bill that prohibits the transportation of a minor across state lines for the purposes of an abortion without the consent of the minor's parents. He has 100% pro-life voting record rating from the NRLC.[35][36]
At a congressional hearing on May 23, 2013, on an abortion bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Gohmert told the story of another couple he knew that decided to go through with their pregnancy despite learning of fetal anomalies. He told Zink, a woman witness, that she should have gone through with her pregnancy despite some doctor's opinion that the brain function was impaired, and then have a better assessment of the baby's health once it was born. Gohmert explained: ""Ms. Zink, having my great sympathy and empathy both, I still come back wondering, shouldnt we wait, like that couple did, and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart? ... So these are ethical issues, they're moral issues, theyre difficult issues, and the parents should certainly be consulted. But it just seems like, its a more educated decision if the child is in front of you to make those decisions"", Gohmert said.[37]
On December 16, 2012, two days after the murder of more than twenty people at an elementary school, Gohmert appeared on Fox News Sunday and suggested that the tragedy would have never happened had the teachers been armed. He told host Chris Wallace, ""I wish to God that she [principal Dawn L. Hochsprung] had had an M-4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out... and takes him out and takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids."" He claimed that the 20 victims who had been killed with a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle had ""defensive wounds"".[38]
On August 12, 2010, Gohmert appeared on Anderson Cooper 360 to defend recent comments he made on the floor of the House regarding ""terror babies"". In a speech about national security made on the House floor in June 2010,[39] Gohmert stated that a retired FBI agent had told him that one of the things the FBI had been looking at were terrorist cells overseas sending young women to become pregnant so they would deliver the baby in the United States, and then take the baby with them back to be raised as a terrorist. When adult, this operativea U.S. citizen by birthcould be easily infiltrated in the U.S. to carry out terrorist actions.[40]
On Fox Business News, Gohmert later claimed that an airline passenger with a relative in Hamas had a grandchild who was to be intentionally born in the United States.[41] In the interview, Gohmert asserted that pregnant women from the Middle East are traveling to the US on tourist visas, planning to deliver the child there.[42] According to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, this automatically grants citizenship to the child. He said that the child would then be returned to the mother's home country and be submitted to a life of terrorist training. Rep. Gohmert said he could not reveal the identity of the retired FBI agent who provided him the information, but he pointed out to a The Washington Post article,[43] which described ""birth tourism"" packages, mainly directed at Chinese tourists. These ""birth tourism"" packages, Gohmert pointed out, take advantage of a ""gaping hole in the security of our country.""[44]
On June 13, 2012, Gohmert was one of five Republican United States representatives (including Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Tom Rooney, Lynn Westmoreland) to send letters to the Inspectors General[45] of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State outlining their ""serious national security concerns"", and asking for ""answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical group's access to top Obama administration officials."" In the letter, Gohmert and the other U.S. lawmakers wrote about information they claim ""raises serious questions about Department of State policies and activities that appear to be a result of influence operations conducted by individuals and organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.""[46]
One of the letters in particular to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, mentioned the Deputy Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin, wife of former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, who had access to sensitive national security and policy information, ""has three family membersher late father, her mother and her brotherconnected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations"", as backed up by a study by the Center for Security Policy.[47][48][49]
Gohmert and his colleagues were praised by Newt Gingrich as the ""National Security Five"" in an editorial on the Politico website. Gingrich expressed he favors investigating the Muslim Brotherhood, and made clear his support to Gohmert and the other four state-elected representatives for rising up concerns that improve national security.[50] Columnist Cal Thomas replied, to accusations of ""McCarthyism"", that the real possibility of infiltration by Islamic extremists deserves to be investigated.[51]

University of Houston Law Center","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Poe","Ted Poe","Republican","federal court judge","Churches of Christ","Lloyd ""Ted"" Poe (born September 10, 1948) is a Republican politician currently representing Texas's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. The district includes many eastern and northern Houston suburbs. He is the first Republican to ever represent the Texas 2nd.


Poe was born in Temple, Texas but attended Spring Woods High School in Houston. Poe now lives in Humble, a suburb of Houston. Poe graduated in 1970, with a degree in political science from Abilene Christian University, where he served as class president. In 1973 he graduated with a juris doctor degree from the University of Houston Law Center. He participated in the school's honor society. From 1970 to 1976, he served in the United States Air Force Reserves C-130 Unit at Houstons Ellington Air Force Base.
After serving as a chief felony prosecutor in Harris County (Houston) for eight years, Poe was appointed a felony court judge in Harris County in 1981, becoming one of the youngest judges in the State of Texas. In this position, he gained national prominence for his unusual criminal sentences that included ordering thieves to carry signs in front of stores from which they stole.[1] However, in at least one case, Poe amended the sentence afterwards without notifying the victim's family.[2]
In November 2004, Poe ran for the U.S. House in the 2nd District. The district had previously been the 9th, represented by four-term Democrat Nick Lampson. However, as the result of a controversial mid-decade redistricting, the new 2nd was considerably more Republican than the old 9th. It lost Galveston and the area around the Johnson Space Center, while picking up several heavily Republican areas around Houston. Poe won 55% of the vote to Lampson's 43%. While Lampson trounced Poe in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Poe swamped Lampson in the Harris County portion of the district.[3]
Poe made border security a centerpiece of his re-election strategy, calling for ""more [National] Guardsmen on the border front"".[4] On November 7, Ted Poe handily won a second term against Democrat Gary Binderim, a water utility manager and community activist,[5][6] and Libertarian Justo Perez.[7][8]
Poe defeated Libertarian Craig Wolfe[9] in his campaign for re-election in 2008.
In addition to Poe's committee assignments, he is the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Victim's Rights Caucus.[10][11] Since 2012, he has been the head of the Congressional Serbian Caucus.[12] He is also a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Tea Party Caucus.
Poe is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[13]
Poe's position on abortion is firmly pro-life. Poe received a 0 rating from abortion rights group NARAL in 2007, and rating of 100 from the National Right to Life Committee in 2007-2008.[14] He also voted for the Prohibiting Federal Funding of Abortion Services amendment on November 7, 2009.[15]
In 2008, the National Taxpayers Union, an organization that supports ""lower taxes and smaller government"", gave Poe the grade B+, and in 2007 received a rating of 90 from the group Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that advocates ""taxes [that] are simpler, [and] flatter"".[16] Also Ted Poe voted against the 2009 Economic Stimulus Package (HR 1) and the 2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 13).[17] The Club for Growth PAC gave Ted Poe a power ranking of 85.85%.[16]
Poe does not support what he calls ""government run health care"".[18] Poe voted ""Nay"" on the Health Care and Insurance Law Amendments bill on November 7, 2009.[19] In 2008 Poe voted for the Medicare Bill (HR 6331).[19] Poe supports healthcare reform that would ""Allow insurance to be purchased across state lines, provide for a safety net for catastrophic injury or illnessand allow for a health savings account"".[20]
Poe is an advocate of stronger action against illegal immigration and increased security on the MexicoUnited States border.[21] He voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and against the DREAM Act when it was introduced in 2010.[22] More recently, he opposed the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, calling it ""an imperial decree to unilaterally ignore portions of the immigration law of the land"".[23] He is the sponsor of the Deport Foreign Convicted Criminals Act of 2011 (H.R. 3256), which would provide for denial of immigrant and non-immigrant visas to nationals of countries which have ""refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation"" of persons ordered deported from the United States.[24]
Poe introduced the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3530; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize the appropriation of $25 million annually over the 2015-2019 period for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide grants to states and other recipients aimed at improving the enforcement of laws against human trafficking and to assist victims of such crimes.[25] According to newspaper The Hill, the bill would ""impose an additional fine of $5,000 on any person convicted of crimes related to sex trafficking, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children or human smuggling.""[26] Some experts say that there are as many as 300,000 cases of sex trafficking in the United States a year, with potentially 25 percent of them having a connection to Texas in some manner.[27] The bill was scheduled to be voted on in the House on May 20, 2014 under a suspension of the rules.[26]
As a state judge, in November 2002, Poe ruled that he would permit the PBS documentary show Frontline to videotape jury deliberations of a capital murder case.[28] There was considerable concern that this would affect the result of the trial, possibly by skewing the composition of the jury, and the decision was appealed by Harris County prosecuters.[29][30] The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal appellate court, ruled against Poe's decision and prohibited the videotaping.[31]
On May 7, 2007, while speaking on the floor of the house, Poe used a quote from Civil War Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest when describing the military strategy that Poe felt the United States should have followed in Iraq. Forrest's maxim was to: Git thar furstest with the mostest. The controversy lies in the personal history of General Forrest; after his military duty was over, he became the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (though soon after called for the Klan to disband). Some critics have stated that despite quoting Forrest for a discussion on military strategy and not on race relations, it was still highly inappropriate for Poe to quote such a divisive figure.[32][33][34][35]
On June 7, 2009, Poe signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen.[36] On July 23, 2009, he appeared on CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight in which he claimed that Certifications of Live Birth issued by Hawaii State Department of Health cannot be used to obtain a U.S. passport, which is untrue.[37][38][39][40] His support of H.R. 1503 and public advocacy for it earned him a negative editorial in the Houston Chronicle.[41]
In August 2011 AlterNet reported that Poe, along with John Culberson and Michael McCaul, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral.[42][43] The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals. VA, however, asserted that this claim was ""blatantly false"" and that VA respects a family's ""rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries"".[42][43]
Ted and his wife Carol have four children (Kim, Kara, Kurt, and Kellee).[44]"
"363","","1991*","1930","Texas 3","Southern Methodist University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Johnson","Sam Johnson","Republican","Texas state legislator","United Methodist","Samuel Robert ""Sam"" Johnson (born October 11, 1930) is an American politician and a retired career United States Air Force officer and fighter pilot. A Republican, he has served as a member of the United States House of Representatives since 1991, representing the 3rd district of Texas. The district includes much of Collin County, as well as Plano, where he lives.


Johnson grew up in Dallas and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School.[1] Johnson graduated from Southern Methodist University in his hometown in 1951, with a degree in business administration. While at SMU, Johnson joined the Delta Chi social fraternity as well as the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity.[2] He served a 29-year career in the United States Air Force, where he served as director of the Air Force Fighter Weapons School and flew the F-100 Super Sabre with the Air Force Thunderbirds precision flying demonstration team. He commanded the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Homestead AFB, Florida and an air division at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, retiring as a Colonel.[3]
He is a veteran of both the Korean and Vietnam Wars as a fighter pilot. During the Korean War, he flew 62 combat missions in the F-86 Sabre and shot down one Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15. During the Vietnam War, Johnson flew the F-4 Phantom II.
In 1966, while flying his 25th combat mission in Vietnam, he was shot down over North Vietnam. He was a prisoner of war for seven years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During this period, he was repeatedly tortured.
Johnson was part of a group of about 11 prisoners known as the Alcatraz Gang, a group of prisoners separated from other captives for their resistance to their captors. They were held in ""Alcatraz"", a special facility about one mile away from the Ha L Prison, notably nicknamed the ""Hanoi Hilton"". Johnson, like the others, was kept in solitary confinement, locked nightly in irons in a 3-by-9-foot cell with the light on around the clock.[4][5][6][7][8]
Johnson recounted the details of his POW experience in his autobiography, Captive Warriors.
Johnson was awarded two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, one Bronze Star with Combat ""V"" for Valor, two Purple Hearts, four Air Medals, and three Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. He was also retroactively awarded the Prisoner of War Medal following its establishment in 1985. He walks with a noticeable limp, due to an old war injury.
After his military career, he established a homebuilding business in Plano. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1984 and was re-elected four times.
In 1990, Johnson was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame.
In October 2009, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society rewarded Johnson the National Patriot Award, the Society's highest civilian award given to Americans who exemplify patriotism and strive to better the nation.[9]
On May 8, 1991, he was elected to the House in a special election brought about by eight-year incumbent Steve Bartlett's resignation to become mayor of Dallas. Johnson defeated fellow conservative Republican Thomas Pauken, also of Dallas, 24,004 (52.6 percent) to 21,647 (47.4 percent).[10]
Johnson thereafter won a full term in 1992 and has been reelected nine times. The 3rd has been in Republican hands since 1968. The Democrats did not even field a candidate in 1992, 1994, 1998, or 2004.
Johnson ran unopposed by the Democratic Party in his district in the 2004 election. Paul Jenkins, an independent, and James Vessels, a member of the Libertarian Party ran against Johnson. Johnson won overwhelmingly in a highly Republican district. Johnson garnered 86% of the vote (178,099), while Jenkins earned 8% (16,850) and Vessels 6% (13,204).
Johnson ran for re-election in 2006, defeating his opponent Robert Edward Johnson in the Republican primary, 85 to 15 percent.[11][12]
In the general election, Johnson faced Democrat Dan Dodd and Libertarian Christopher J. Claytor. Both Dodd and Claytor are West Point graduates. Dodd served two tours of duty in Vietnam [13] and Claytor served in Operation Southern Watch in Kuwait in 1992. [1] It was only the fourth time that Johnson had faced Democratic opposition.
Johnson retained his seat, taking 62.5% of the vote, while Democrat Dodd received 34.9% and Libertarian Claytor received 2.6%. However, this was far less than in years past, when Johnson won by margins of 80 percent or more.
Johnson retained his seat in the House of Representatives by defeating the Democrat Tom Daley and Libertarian nominee Christopher J. Claytor in the 2008 general election. He won with 60 percent of the vote, an unusually low total for such a heavily Republican district.[11]
Johnson won re-election with 66.3% of the vote against Democrat John Lingenfelder (31.3%) and Libertarian Christopher Claytor (2.4%).[14]
Johnson handily won re-nomination to his thirteenth term, twelfth full term, in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4. He polled 30,943 votes (80.5 percent); two challengers, Josh Loveless and Harry Pierce, held the remaining combined 19.5 percent of the votes cast.[15]
In the House, Johnson is an ardent conservative. By some views, Johnson had the most conservative record in the House for three consecutive years, opposing pork barrel projects of all kinds, voting for more IRAs and against extending unemployment benefits. The conservative watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste has consistently rated him as being friendly to taxpayers. Johnson is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[16]
Johnson is a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, and joined Dan Burton, Ernest Istook and John Doolittle in refounding it in 1994 after Newt Gingrich pulled its funding. He alternated as chairman with the other three co-founders from 1994 to 1999, and served as sole chairman from 2000 to 2001.
On the Ways and Means Committee, he was an early advocate and, then, sponsor of the successful repeal in 2000 of the earnings limit for Social Security recipients. He proposed the Good Samaritan Tax Act to permit corporations to take a tax deduction for charitable giving of food. He chairs the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations, where he has encouraged small business owners to expand their pension and [17] benefits for employees.
Johnson is a skeptic of calls for increased government regulation related to global warming whenever such government interference would, in his mind, restrict personal liberties or damage economic growth and American competitiveness in the market place. He also opposes calls for government intervention in the name of energy reform if such reform would hamper the market and or place undue burdens on individuals seeking to earn decent wages. He has expressed his belief that the Earth has untapped sources of fuel, and has called for allowing additional drilling for oil in Alaska.
Johnson is one of two Vietnam-era POWs still serving in Congress, along with John McCain.[18]
Johnson is married to the former Shirley L. Melton, of Dallas. They are parents of three children and have ten grandchildren."

He defeated incumbent United States Representative Ralph Hall, who was the oldest member of congress at the time, in the runoff primary election on May 27, 2014. Ratcliffe was unopposed in the November 4, 2014 general election and was sworn in as a member of the 114th United States Congress on January 6, 2015.


Ratcliffe was born the youngest of six children. Both of his parents were teachers.[3] In 1987, Ratcliffe graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a B.A. in Government and International Studies. He earned his J.D. from Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law in 1989.[4]
He is board certified in Civil Trial Law by the National Board of Trial Advocacy. He has served as Adjunct Professor of Law at various law schools, including SMU and Texas Wesleyan University. Between 2004-2012, he was elected to four consecutive terms as mayor of Heath, Texas.[5]
In 2004, Republican President George W. Bush appointed Ratcliffe to be Chief of Anti-Terrorism and National Security for the Eastern District of Texas in the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2007, he was appointed United States Attorney of the Eastern District of Texas. It covered 33,000 square miles, including almost all of the 4th Congressional District. He managed 100 federal prosecutors, 6 district offices, and a $12 million budget allocated by the DOJ. On April 16, 2008, Operation Plymouth Rock led to the successful prosecution of hundreds of illegal aliens who unlawfully gained employment, which resulted in a $4.5 million criminal penalty.[4] Following his public service, he went back into private law practice, becoming a partner with the The Ashcroft Law Firm, LLC. He served as an aide to Mitt Romney as part of a transition team established before the 2012 elections for vetting potential government appointees.[6]
Ratcliffe decided to run in the Republican primary against 17-term incumbent Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas's 4th congressional district. At 91 years old, Hall was the oldest member of Congress and the oldest person ever to serve in the House of Representatives. The Dallas Morning News wrote that Ratcliffe was Hall's ""most serious political challenge in years.""[7] In a primary where Hall had begun to look increasingly vulnerable, Ratcliffe received the endorsement of the Dallas Morning News which applauded Hall's long record of public service but cited Ratcliffe's ""impressive credentials"" and the need for ""new ideas and fresh energy.""[8]
In the March 4 primary, Ratcliffe finished second with 29 percent of the vote, behind Hall's 45 percent. However, since Hall came up short of a majority, a runoff was forced on May 27. Ratcliffe was subsequently endorsed by the Tea Party Express, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and Club For Growth. Hall was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, former Congressman Ron Paul, congresswoman Michele Bachmann, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.[9]
In the May 27 runoff, Ratcliffe defeated Hall with 53 percent of the vote to Hall's 47 percent. Ratcliffe won 11 of the district's 18 counties, including the four largest (Grayson, Rockwall, Hunt and Lamar).
Although it is very rare in any event for a primary challenger to defeat a sitting congressman, Ratcliffe's victory was historic as it marked the first time that a sitting Republican congressman in Texas had been ousted in a primary. Incumbents had previously been successful in all 257 attempts.[10] Hall's defeat was also the first by an incumbent member of Congress in the 2014 election cycle. Ratcliffe was unopposed in the November 4th general election and was sworn in as a member of the 114th United States Congress on January 6, 2015. He is just the fourth person to represent the district in the last 100 years.
Ratcliffe serves on the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee. He is also the Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity. He was named to the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel.[11]
Ratcliffe and his wife, Michele, reside in Heath, Texas, with their two daughters."

A member of the Republican Party, Hensarling currently chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and has previously served as the chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2011 to 2013.


Hensarling was born in Stephenville, the seat of government of Erath County in Central Texas; he was reared on the family farm in College Station. His father, Charles Andrew ""Chase"" Hensarling (1928-2014), was also a native of Stephenville, a 1949 graduate of Texas A&M University, and a United States Army officer. Charles Hensarling was engaged in the poultry business and was the president of Hy-Lay Hatcheries in Bryan, Texas. He also worked as an A&M Extension Agent and was a past president of the Texas Egg Council. In 1953, Charles Hensarling married the former Ann Brock. He served as president of the Texas A&M Consolidated Independent School District and was a past president of Our Saviors Lutheran Church Council in College Station. He later was a member of the Abiding Savior Lutheran Church Council in Cameron in Milam County, Texas, where he and his wife, retired. In addition to Jeb Hensarling, Charles and Ann have an older son, James Andrew Hensarling (born 1954) and wife, Lee of Tyler and a daughter, Carolyn Hensarling Arizpe and husband, Homero, of San Antonio, Texas.[1]
Like his father, Jeb Hensarling graduated from Texas A&M University; he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1979. In 1982, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas School of Law at Austin. He is an Eagle Scout.
Prior to serving in Congress, Hensarling was State Director for Texas Senator Phil Gramm from 1985 until 1989. From 1991 to 1993, he served as executive director of the Republican Senatorial Committee.
Hensarling next served as a vice president at two companies before becoming owner of San Jacinto Ventures in 1996 and CEO of Family Support Assurance Corporation in 2001. He served as vice president of Green Mountain Energy from 1999 to 2001.
Hensarling was elected to his first term in 2002, defeating Democratic opponent Ron Chapman with 58 percent of the vote. He was reelected in 2004 with 64 percent of the vote over Democratic challenger Bill Bernstein.
A December 31, 2005 article in National Review profiled his work as the country's ""budget nanny"", saying that he has replaced his mentor, former Senator Phil Gramm, in this role. Hensarling's proposed legislation is said to intend to force Congress to ""decide how much money they can afford to spend, and then prioritize within those limits."" The article says that ""the chief problem with any proposal to reform the budget process is that it excites almost nobody.""
Hensarling was elected chairman of the Republican Study Committee following the 2006 Congressional elections, defeating Todd Tiahrt.
After the 2012 election, Hensarling was elected as chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services, succeeding Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.).[2][3]
Hensarling opposed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress), a bill that would delay some of the reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program.[4] Hensarling criticized the bill, saying the bill would ""postpone actuarially sound rates for perhaps a generation... (and) kill off a key element of risk-based pricing permanently, which is necessary if we are to ever transition to market competition.""[4] Hensarling criticized the National Flood Insurance Programs for regularly underestimating flood risk.[4]
Hensarling has maintained a conservative voting record: he has consistently voted against pro-choice legislation, stem cell research, same-sex marriage and hate crimes legislation, and consistently supported free trade policies, the PATRIOT Act, and a Constitutional amendment against flag burning.[5]
Hensarling serves on the House Committee on the Budget and the House Committee on Financial Services, in which position the Dallas Morning News has described him as a rising congressional star and a man of conviction[citation needed], and the New York Times has described him as a conservative leader.[citation needed] According to the National Taxpayers Union, Hensarling scored the highest pro-taxpayer rating in the Texas delegation, and the second highest in the entire U.S. House of Representatives.
Hensarling co-authored a Constitutional amendment (known as the Spending Limit Amendment) that would prohibit federal spending from growing faster than the economy.
Hensarling has continually pushed Congress to enact a one-year moratorium on all Congressional earmarks, saying that the process needs to be overhauled. In 2007, he introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. He also co-authored the Taxpayer Choice Act.
In January 2008, Hensarling co-authored the Economic Growth Act of 2008.
In May 2008, Hensarling pressed the Republican party leadership in the House to agree to a special session to give lawmakers to air their views on a new policy platform and share ideas on how to define themselves to better advantage going into the 2008 election.[citation needed]
On January 29, 2010, during President Barack Obama's meeting with House Republicans, Hensarling challenged Obama's position on the budget, asserting that the Obama White House was increasing the national deficit at the same rate per month that the previous President had increased it per year. President Obama responded with the following: ""the whole question was structured as a talking point for running a campaign....[t]he fact of the matter is that when we came into office, the deficit was $1.3 trillion. So when you say that suddenly I've got a monthly budget that is higher than the annual  or a monthly deficit that's higher than the annual deficit left by Republicans, that's factually just not true, and you know it's not true.""[6] The Congressional Budget Office issued a projection in January 2009, before Obama took office, that the budget deficit would reach $1.2 trillion that year.[7]
In September 2008, Hensarling led House Republican efforts to oppose Secretary Henry Paulson and Chairman Ben Bernanke's $700 billion financial bailout, and urged caution before Congress rushed to approve the plan. After voting against the bill, Hensarling said,
Following September 29 House vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 777 points in a single day, its largest single-day point drop ever. The House subsequently passed the bill in a second vote on October 3.
On November 19, 2008 Hensarling was appointed by United States House of Representatives Minority Leader John Boehner to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. He was the lone dissenting member on the ""Accountability for the Troubled Asset Relief Program"" report issued by the panel on January 9, 2009.[8]
In 2008, Hensarling was mentioned as a possible candidate for Republican Conference Chairman, then the number three position in the House Republican leadership. However, Hensarling instead endorsed former Republican Study Committee Chairman Mike Pence, a longtime friend and ally.[9] After the 2010 elections, Pence stepped down from the House to run for Governor of Indiana. Hensarling succeeded Pence as Conference Chairman, becoming the fourth-ranking Republican, as the Republican Party had won control of the House of Representatives in 2010. Hensarling stepped down from leadership after the 2012 elections to become Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.[10][11]
Prior to Eric Cantor's primary defeat, Hensarling was mentioned as a potential rival to Cantor to succeed John Boehner as leader of the House Republicans.[12][13] Hensarling may run for Speaker or Majority Leader after the 2014 elections.[14]"

Purdue University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Barton","Joe Barton","Republican","oil industry consultant","United Methodist","Joe Linus Barton (born September 15, 1949) is a Republican politician, representing Texas's 6th congressional district (map) in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1985, and a member of the Tea Party Caucus. The district includes Arlington, part of Fort Worth and several rural areas south of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.


Barton was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Bess Wynell (ne Buice) and Larry Linus Barton.[1] He graduated from Waco High School. He attended Texas A&M University in College Station on a Gifford-Hill Opportunity Award scholarship[2] and received a B.S. in industrial engineering in 1972. An M.Sc. in industrial administration from Purdue University followed in 1973. Following college, Barton entered private industry until 1981, when he became a White House Fellow and served under United States Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards. Later, he began consulting for Atlantic Richfield Oil and Gas Co., before being elected to the United States Congress, in 1984.[3]
Barton made his first run for elected office in 1984, when he entered the Republican primary for Texas's 6th congressional district after three-term incumbent Phil Gramm left his seat to run for the United States Senate that year. He finished first in the five-candidate field with 42%[4] and very narrowly defeated Max Hoyt in the runoff with 50%.[5] He then defeated Democratic nominee and former State Representative Dan Kubiak 57%-43%.[6] Barton was one of six freshmen Republican U.S. congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack.[citation needed]
In 1986, Barton won re-election against Democratic candidate Pete Geren, who would later be elected to Congress from a neighboring district. Barton defeated Geren 56%-44%.[7]
During this period, Barton won each re-election with 60% of the vote or more.[8] His worst general election performance was in 2006, when he defeated Democratic candidate David Harris 60%-37%, a 23 point margin.[9] The 2008 election was his second worst performance, defeating Democratic candidate Ludwig Otto by a 26 point margin, 62%-36%.[10]
He was only challenged in the primary twice in this time period: 1992 and 1994. In 1992, he defeated Mike McGinn 79%-21%.[11] In 1994, he defeated Jerry Goode 89%-11%.[12]
Because of the increasing controversy surrounding his record in office, election battles have been increasingly contentious. In 2011, a Super PAC was formed by Texas conservative groups to remove him and several other long-time incumbents from office.[13] The Democratic National Committee has used Barton's comments in political ads, shown nationally against all Republican candidates.[14] Several websites have been created and dedicated to simply removing Joe Barton from office. DefeatJoeBarton.com/ was created by Democratic challengers. All content was later removed, although the site is still owned.[15]
Barton drew three primary challengers: Joe Chow, mayor of Addison; Itamar Gelbman, a security consultant; and Frank C. Kuchar, a Dallas businessman and former preacher. Chow is Texas' first Asian-American mayor. He called Barton the most corrupt congressman in the State of Texas.[16] At the end of March 2012, Barton had $1.3 million in cash on hand, compared with $28,800 for Chow, $178,000 for Gelbman, and $463 for Kuchar.[17]
In the Republican primary on March 4, Barton won handy re-nomination to a sixteenth term in the U.S. House. He polled 32,579 (72.7 percent); his 2012 primary opponent, Frank Kuchar, trailed with 12,260 votes (27.3 percent).[18] On November 4th, Barton handedly won re-election over Democrat opponent Cozad. Barton serves as the Dean of the Texas Delegation for the 114th Congress.[citation needed]
Barton voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in both of its manifestations.[19][20]
In March 2011, Barton sponsored the Better Use of Light Bulbs Act, which would repeal the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, signed by President George W. Bush. The 2007 law would set energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, effectively eliminating most or all incandescent light bulbs. Barton said ""People don't want Congress dictating what light fixtures they can use.""[21]
In 2005, prompted by a February 2005 Wall Street Journal article,[26] Barton launched an investigation into two climate change studies from 1998 and 1999.[23] In his letters to the authors of the studies he requested details on the studies and the sources of the authors grant funding.[27] The Washington Post condemned Barton's investigation as a ""witch-hunt"".[28] During Former Vice President Al Gore's testimony to the Energy and Commerce Committee in March 2007, Barton asserted to Gore that ""You're not just off a little, you're totally wrong"" (climate scientists have refuted Barton's assertion[29]), stating that ""Global Warming science is uneven and evolving.""[30] In 2013, when discussing the Keystone XL pipeline, he referred to the Genesis flood narrative in the Bible to argue that current climate change isn't man-made.[31]
Barton tried to block the bipartisan Combating Autism Act of 2006. He said that the money steered toward environmental causes of autism were not the reason he blocked passage of the bill.[32]
The controversy stemmed from the conflict between two bills in the House and Senate. Barton introduced the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006,[33] while Senator Rick Santorum introduced the Autism bill. Santorum said in a CNN interview that the Senate bill was intended to be ""fit into"" Barton's bill in the House bill. He stated that ""I was in constant conversation with him [Barton] and many House members all last week in an attempt to help the NIH bill come through the Senate, as well as try to move the Combating Autism bill through the Senate."" Santorum stated that the Senate bill would investigate possible environmental causes, while the House bill would prevent that.[34]
Barton let the bill die in committee, which upset many people who were vocal about saying Barton had sacrificed the interests of autistic children in the interests of the oil and gas companies that donate heavily to his campaign.[35][36]
On June 17, 2010, Barton accused the White House of a ""$20 billion shakedown"" of oil giant BP after the company reached an agreement with the Obama administration to establish an escrow account to pay the claims of people harmed by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[37] He made the accusation at the outset of a House hearing where BP's chief executive officer, Tony Hayward, appeared for the first time before Congress. Facing Hayward at the witness table, Barton said, ""I apologize. I do not want to live in a country where any time a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, is subject to some sort of political pressure that is, again, in my words  amounts to a shakedown, so I apologize."" [38] Prior to the establishment of the agreement, the Obama administration had been public in their criticism of BP for the oil spill; Barton and other critics[who?] accused the White House of attempting to deflect criticism on how they handled the situation, which made it more difficult for BP to raise short-term funds in the capital market for their operations.[38]
Barton's remarks were widely criticized by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, Vice President Joe Biden,[39] GOP congressional leadership[40] and fellow Republicans, some of whom called on Barton to relinquish his leadership role in the House Energy Subcomittee.[41][42]
Barton later said that his earlier remarks had been ""misconstrued"" and that he believed BP was responsible for the accident. Later that day, he issued a statement apologizing for using the term ""shakedown"" and fully retracted his apology to BP.[24][43]
Barton has questioned the wisdom of deficit spending to fund an extensive national wind turbine energy generation grid.[44]
In November 2011, Barton criticized President Barack Obama for delaying his decision on the Keystone pipeline. He said ""We asked him to make a decision, not to wait another two years. That's bullshit. [45]
The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011.[46][47] The article states that on Barton's 2008 financial disclosure statement, he inaccurately reported on the source of a natural gas interest that he bought into. The share was purchased through a longtime donor and supporter who later died. This was discovered by the Dallas Morning News in 2010.[48] According to the Dallas Morning News article, Barton made over $100,000 on the investment. The article and CREW Report both point out how Barton buying this undervalued asset from an ""advisor"" on energy issues could be a conflict of interest to the Congressman's position as the Chair of the House's Energy Subcommittee. It quotes James Thurber, a professor of government at American University, as saying ""If you are elected as a public servant to try to do what is right for the public generally and then you use that position to help bring in material wealth, I think it's unethical.""[48] Despite this discovery, Barton chose to neither respond to, nor correct his misreporting.[citation needed]
CREW also reported that Barton paid his wife Terri $57,759 in salary and bonuses, from his campaign funds in the 2006 election cycle.[49] A spokesman said that Terri served as the campaign's outreach director and planned fund raising and special events.[22] Barton's daughter Kristin was paid $12,622 in salary and bonuses and his mother, Nell Barton, was paid $7,000 for a car.[22]
Barton expressed in September 2014, his full support of the United States lifting the 40-year old ban on crude oil exports - an issue that sparked controversy among members of the Republican Party. Several research reports have found that exporting the glut of shale oil would ultimately lower U.S. and global fuel prices, rather than raise them, U.S. public opinion remains divided on the issue.[50]
In 1993, Barton ran in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Lloyd Bentsen, who became United States Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration. Barton finished third in the contest, behind state treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Bob Krueger, thus missing a runoff slot. He divided the more conservative vote in that election with House colleague Jack Fields of Houston.
The Barton Family Foundation was established in 2005 to support charities within the congressman's district. His daughter-in-law, Amy Barton, is the Foundation's Executive Director. Major energy corporations, such as the Chicago-based nuclear energy producer, Exelon Corporation, make major gifts to the Foundation. In June 2008, at a time when Barton had introduced legislation to assist corporations with the recycling of spent nuclear fuel, the corporation donated $25,000 to the Foundation. Exelon has also donated $80,000 to Barton's campaign funds. The Foundation gave $90,000 to the local Boys and Girls Club, this is the only recorded donation made by the Foundation in its seven year history.[51]
Terri Barton divorced Joe Barton in February 2015.[citation needed] He has four children and five grandchildren.[3]
Barton's office announced that on December 15, 2005 he suffered a heart attack and was taken to George Washington University Hospital.[52]
Barton revealed during a congressional hearing on video games that he was a video game player. He announced that he had ""worked [his] way up to Civilization IV"".[53]
Barton has been an advocate of a playoff system to determine a national champion for college football, even introducing legislation to require that any game being marketed as a national championship game be a part of a playoff.[54] On May 1, 2010, Barton grilled Bowl Championship Series coordinator John Swofford, saying of the BCS that, ""It's like communism. You can't fix it."" He also suggested that the 'C' be dropped from the BCS and it be called ""the 'BS' system.""[55]"

He is a member of the Republican Party and the Tea Party caucus. The district takes in large portions of western Houston and surrounding Harris County.


Culberson was born in Houston, Texas, the son of Eleanor (ne Abney) and James Vincent Culberson.[1] His great-grandmother was Swedish.[1] Culberson attended West University Elementary School, Lanier Middle School, and Lamar High School.[2][3] He graduated from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1981 with a degree in history. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from South Texas College of Law in 1989. He is a distant relative of former Governor of Texas Charles Allen Culberson.[citation needed]
During his time in law school, Culberson was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, serving his first term in 1987. He was a member of the Republican Whip team, becoming Minority Whip in 1999 during his last term. Culberson began working for the law firm of Lorance and Thompson as a civil defense attorney after he graduated from South Texas. Culberson led the effort to regain state control of the Texas prison system. He also worked for expansion of urban freeway systems and for increased development of medical technology.[citation needed]
Like Bill Archer, Culberson is an ardent fiscal and social conservative. His website includes his slogan ""Letting Texans run Texas,"" which Culberson sees as a way to personify historical Jeffersonian values. Culberson is a member of the Appropriations Committee.[citation needed]
On Hardball with Chris Matthews, Culberson defended Texas Governor Rick Perry's secession comments saying ""don't make too much of what Gov. Perry said, again, he was just revved up and I think in the heat of the moment said something that he certainly didn't mean in his heart. [Texans are] patriotic Americans. No one wants Texas to secede"" .[citation needed]
On June 12, 2009, Culberson signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories.[4]
Culberson is active online with Twitter[5] and Qik.[6] He has used these online information dispersion services from House Committee meetings and from the Oval Office. On August 1, 2008, to protest the House going into summer recess without discussing a pending energy bill, Culberson and other House Republicans stayed to make speeches about the energy bill in question. The Democratic leadership in the House, which controls services in the chamber, responded by cutting the microphones and cameras. Culberson used the Twitter and Qik services to provide a live account of the proceedings. Culberson later compared this episode to the Iranian government's brutal crackdown against Twitter-coordinated protesters in June 2009.[7]
On April 17, 2014, Culberson introduced the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4486; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives.[8] The bill would make appropriations for fiscal year 2015 for military construction and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.[9] The total amount appropriated by the introduced version of the bill is $71.5 billion, approximately $1.8 billion less than fiscal year 2014 due to a decrease in the need for military construction.[9]
Culberson won the Republican nomination for the 7th District in 2000 after 15-term incumbent Bill Archer announced his retirement. He finished first in the Republican primary  traditionally the real contest in what has historically been a heavily Republican district  and defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff. He won easily in November, taking about 75% of the vote.
In 2008, Culberson faced his stiffest challenge to date in businessman Michael Skelly in the November 2008 election. Skelly, a former executive of Horizon Wind Energy, also served in the Peace Corps and earned an MBA from Harvard University. Skelly served on Mayor Bill White's Green Building Advisory Committee.[10] Culberson led with 56 percent of the vote with about two-thirds of precincts counted. Skelly had 43 percent of the vote. This was the closest a Democratic candidate had come to winning the district since it was created in 1967. Historically, Republicans at all levels garner well over 60 percent of the vote in this district.[citation needed]
As of June 30, 2008, Culberson had raised $983,204 with $550,228 cash on hand. As of the same date, Skelly had raised $1,465,519 with $1,050,314 cash on handmore than any of Culberson's four previous challengers. In the previous four election cycles, Culberson had raised $1,092,972 (2000), $508,138 (2002), $628,783 (2004), and $718,882 (2006). In 2006, Jim Henley raised $122,145.[11]
Culberson ran unopposed.
Culberson was challenged by the Democratic nominee James Cargas, an energy lawyer for the City of Houston, Green party nominee Lance Findley, and Libertarian Drew Parks.
In the November 4, 2014 general election, Culberson again faces Democrat James Cargas, who polled 4,092 votes (62.1 percent) in the March 4 primary election.[12] Culberson was unopposed in the Republican primary.
In August 2011 AlterNet reported that Culberson, along with Ted Poe and Michael McCaul, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldiers funeral.[13][14] The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals, however, VA state this claim is ""blatantly false"" as VA respects a families ""rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries"".[13][14]
Culberson also courted controversy in 2013, when he said ""like 9/11, 'let's roll!'"" to describe a vote to make a delay of the Affordable Health Act a condition for funding the government.[15]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes a large swath of suburban and rural territory north of Houston.


Brady was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, one of five children of William F. and Nancy A. Brady. His father, a lawyer, was killed in 1967 in a courtroom shooting in Rapid City when Brady was 12 years old. His mother was left to raise five children by herself. Student body president and a four-sport athlete, Brady graduated from Rapid City Central High School in 1973. Working his way through college holding a variety of jobsconstruction worker, meat packer, manufacturing worker, waiter, and bartenderBrady earned a degree in mass communications from the University of South Dakota in Vermillion,[1] where he played varsity baseball, served in the student government association and became a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. In 2005 he was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the university, and in 2001 was a recipient of the Order of Achievement by the national Lambda Chi Alpha organization.
A chamber of commerce executive at the Rapid City Area Chamber of Commerce, Brady was elected to the Rapid City Common Council at age 26. In 1982 he moved to Texas to work for the Beaumont Chamber of Commerce and later the South Montgomery County Woodlands Chamber of Commerce.
Brady began his Texas political career in 1990 when he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, representing The Woodlands, parts of Montgomery County, and five other counties west and north of Houston.
Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Jack Fields of Texas' 8th congressional district decided to retire. Brady decided to run and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six candidate field. But the candidate who ranked first, Dr. Gene Fontenot, received just 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold.[2] In the run-off election, Brady defeated him 53%47%.[3] However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Bush v. Vera that three congressional districts in Texas were unconstitutional.[4] After holding hearings, the court concluded that there was no longer time to hold primaries and instead forced all candidates (Democrats and Republicans) be listed together on the November general election ballot in a jungle primary. If no candidate reached 50%, a special runoff would be held on December 10 between the two highest ranking candidates regardless of political party. In the November election, Brady ranked first with 41% of the vote.[5] In the December run-off election, he defeated Fontenot again 59%41%.[6]
During this time period, he never won re-election with less than 67% of the vote.[7]
For the first time since 1998, Brady was challenged in the Republican primary. Three candidates filed against him. He defeated all of them in the March primary with 79% of the vote.[8] He won re-election with 80% of the vote.[9] In the May 2012, Republican primary in a newly-redrawn district he defeated his challenger with 76% of the vote. In the November 6, 2012 general election he defeated his Democratic opponent with over 77% of the vote.
In the Republican primary on March 4, Brady easily won re-nomination to a tenth term in the U.S. House. He polled 41,549 votes (68 percent) to 19,508 (32 percent) for his intraparty challenger, Craig McMichael.[10]
In the General election held November 4, 2014 Brady was easily re-elected to his seat in the U.S. House. He polled 124,897 votes (89.32 percent) to 14,930 (10.67 percent) for his challenger, Ken Petty.[11]
Brady has been a reliable conservative and serves as a Deputy Whip for the House majority. He has advocated lower taxes, deficit reduction and free trade, and called for replacing the income tax with a national sales tax.
As a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee he has chaired the Trade Sub-Committee and, beginning this year, became chairman of the Health Sub-Committee which places him in the center of congressional debate on Medicare and President Obama's new health care law. He was also recently tapped to lead the Energy Working Group as the committee pursues comprehensive tax reform in 2013.
In 2002, Rep. Brady voted in favor of the authorization of force against the nation of Iraq.
In 2004 he led the successful effort to restore the sales tax deduction, which had been eliminated in 1986. Brady has been a leader on free trade within Congress, serving as President George W. Bush's point man on the successful passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the recent agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. However, he is best known as the author of a federal ""sunset law"" that would require every federal program not specifically written into the Constitution to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.[12] He has introduced this bill at the beginning of every Congress. It was approved overwhelmingly by the House as an amendment in 2004 but did not progress further. In 2006 it passed the Government Reform Committee but did not reach a floor vote.
Brady is the Chairman of the U.S. House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, the third Texan to lead the committee (Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and Rep. Wright Patman). Brady and his staff developed the ""Organizational Chart of the House Democrats Health Plan"", the complex chart that showed the creation of at least 31 new federal agencies, commissions and mandates included in the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009. He has also called on Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to step down, citing rising unemployment, exaggerated stimulus job claims, unsustainable debt and ""failed economic policies"" of the Obama administration.
Recently he has introduced three major pieces of legislation: The MAP Act which shrinks the size of the federal government, abolishes obsolete agencies, establishes a line item-veto for each President and permanently ends the threat of a future government shutdown; the Sound Dollar Act which reforms the Federal Reserve(see below)and most recently the Centennial Monetary Commission which creates a bi-partisan commission to examine the Federal Reserve Bank's effectiveness and role over the first 100 years of existence and make Legislative recommendations for its second century of existence.
In March 2012, he proposed the Sound Dollar Act, which ii require the Federal Reserve to monitor gold and the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. Dollar. The bill would also replace the Federal Reserves dual mandate of controlling unemployment and inflation with one mandate for U.S. Dollar price stability.[13]
Brady's district was hit hard by Hurricane Rita and again by Hurricane Ike, and he has helped lead the Texas recovery effort in the House for both disasters. In 2011, in the interim redistricting map approved by a San Antonio federal court, the 8th District lost seven counties in east and southeast Texas and gained all or part of six counties going north toward Dallas.
On April 9, 2014, Brady introduced the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress) into the House.[14] The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the calculation method and the rate for the tax credit for qualified research expenses that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent.[15] The bill was supported by organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform, but was opposed by the Obama Administration because it did not pay for the credits with any offsets.[16][17][18]
Brady lives in The Woodlands, a suburb of Houston with his wife Cathy and two young sons (Will and Sean).[19] He is an original Hometown Hero of The Woodlands awarded by Interfaith-of-The Woodlands, a Paul Harris Fellow in The Woodlands Rotary Club and a member of Saints Simon & Jude Catholic Church. He and his family did not move to Washington, D.C. and he continues to commute from Texas to work in Congress each week.[citation needed]
On October 7, 2005 Brady was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol while in South Dakota to accept a distinguished alumni award. He was returning from a reception with his mother, wife, sister, and brother-in-law in the car when it was pulled over for a non-working tail light. He faced a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. He pleaded no contest. Upon his misdemeanor conviction on November 8, he was fined $350, and his right to drive in South Dakota was suspended for 30 days. Before his sentencing, Brady had stated that ""no one is above the law"" and he would accept ""every consequence"" of his actions, even if that meant a jail sentence. ""To me, regardless of how this turns out, what it says is that you don't get behind the wheel."" [20]"

""Al"" Green (born September 1, 1947) is the U.S. Representative from Texas' 9th congressional district, serving since 2005. The district includes most of southwestern Houston, including most of that city's share of Fort Bend County. It also includes most of Missouri City.


Green was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended FAMU and transferred to Tuskegee University, from which he earned a bachelor's degree. He later went on to receive his Juris Doctor in 1974 from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. After receiving his law degree and being admitted to the Texas Bar, he remained in Houston and currently lives in the Alief community.
In 1978, Green was elected Justice of the Peace in Harris County, Texas in the Precinct 7, Place Two position. He held this position for 26 years.
A former trial lawyer, Green co-founded the firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He also served as president of the Houston NAACP and, during his term as the organization's leader, membership increased sevenfold. While serving as NAACP leader, he focused on increasing minority hiring in Texas and forming alliances with Hispanic groups.
Green is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[2]
While still serving as a Justice of the Peace, Green ran for mayor of Houston in 1981, finishing a distant fifth in the primary.
In 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th District. The district had previously been the 25th, represented by freshman Democrat Chris Bell. However, Bell was placed in significant jeopardy as a result of the 2003 Texas redistricting. Although the district was heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger number of blacks and Latinos than its predecessor. The old 25th had been 65 percent white, while the new 9th was 17 percent white, 37 percent black and 33 percent Latino. This left Bell vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat, and prompted him to file an ethics challenge against Tom DeLay.
In the March 9 primary, Green crushed Bell with 66 percent of the vote to Bell's 31 percent. He beat the Republican nominee Annette Molina in November. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian in 2008. This is not surprising given this district's partisan tilt; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+22, it is the second-most Democratic district in Houston.
While in Congress, Green has focused on issues similar to those that he worked for while with the NAACP. Fair housing and hiring practices for the poor and minorities are some of his greatest concerns.
Green, a Democrat, shows strong liberal tendencies on social issues.
He is pro-choice, and consistently votes accordingly. On October 13, 2011, he voted against an amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prevented insurance gained through the Act to cover abortions.[3] The bill passed convincingly in the House. Green has voted against eight other bills proposed in the House that would prevent any government spending to cover abortion. Due to this, he has received 100% ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, while receiving a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.[4]
Green also supports gun control. He spoke out after the Trayvon Martin shooting, asking members of the African-American community to show faith in the justice system and let the courts do their job and convict George Zimmerman.[5] The National Rifle Association gave him a rating of 0%, and Gun Owners of America rated him 25%, but the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him a Lifetime Score of 83%.[4]
On budget issues, Congressman Green strongly follows his partys views. He has supported every budget bill proposed during President Obamas term. However, during President Bushs term, he voted against all bills to cut government spending and taxes.[3] Green also voted for President Obama's bailout of the Auto Industry in 2009.[3] On December 10th, 2008, he wrote a statement supporting the bailout, saying, The auto bailout is really about bailing out people, and the people of this country... I think that [how tax dollars are spent] is a legitimate concern for the American people, but I do think, with the proper strings attached, we can bail out the people...who may lose their jobs.[6]
Congressman Green is a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. He is a strong supporter of holding on to Pakistan as an ally in South Asia. After the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on December 27th, 2007, which initially destabilized the country as riots erupted, Green issued a statement condemning the assassination as a dastardly effort to circumvent the democratic process. He announced the USs continued alliance with Pakistan, and urged Pakistanis to continue pushing towards democracy, knowing that freedom, justice, and democracy are difficult to achieve.[7]
After the 2012 election, in which he was once again reelected in Texas' 9th district,[8] Green spoke at a press conference in Houston. He emphasized the need for the lame duck Congress to work together to reform the budget. He announced his plan to propose infrastructure development across the country, in order to create jobs and unify America.[9]
Green is a supporter of the Federal Reserve's program of quantitative easing and claims that it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2008.[10]"

Since the beginning of the 113th Congress, he has been the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district stretches from Austin to Houston. As of 2012[update] he is the wealthiest member of Congress.


McCaul was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Frances Jane (Lott) and James Addington McCaul, Jr. He has English, Irish, and German ancestry.[1] He graduated from Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from San Antonio's Trinity University in 1984 and his Juris Doctor from St. Mary's University in 1987. McCaul also attended Harvard University, taking courses in the Kennedy School of Government.[2]
McCaul worked as an attorney and a federal prosecutor before entering politics. He was the Chief of Counterterrorism and National Security for Texas's branch of the US Attorney's office also worked under the Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section. After he left the USDOJ, McCaul took a position as a Deputy Attorney General in 1998 with the Texas Attorney General's Office and served in this capacity until 2002.
He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004. He won a crowded Republican primary in the newly created 10th District. The district was thought to be so heavily Republican that no Democratic candidate even filed, effectively handing the seat to McCaul.
In 2006 he defeated Democratic candidate Ted Ankrum and former Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik with 55% of the vote. McCaul won re-election once again in 2008, against Democratic candidate Larry Joe Doherty and Libertarian candidate Matt Finkel[3] by a 54% to 43% margin.
In 2010, he was re-elected to a fourth term by a wide margin (76.26%) against Democratic candidate Ted Ankrum (22.26%) and Libertarian candidate Jeremiah JP Perkins (1.47%).
In August 2011 AlterNet reported that McCaul, along with John Culberson and Ted Poe, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral.[4][5] The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals, however, VA state this claim is ""blatantly false"" as VA respects a families ""rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries"".[4][5]
In September 2013, McCaul said that he would trust Russians rather than Americans to account for Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.[6] He did say that the monitoring and destruction of the chemical weapons in Syria would have to be overseen by an international commission of the United Nations, emphasizing that Putin and Russia have superior leverage over Syria to better accomplish the removal of WMD from the Syrian arsenal.
On December 11, 2013, McCaul introduced the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3696; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct cybersecurity activities on behalf of the federal government and would codify the role of DHS in preventing and responding to cybersecurity incidents involving the Information Technology (IT) systems of federal civilian agencies and critical infrastructure in the United States.[7][8] McCaul said that the bill was ""an important step toward addressing the cyber threat.""[9] According to McCaul, the bill ""establishes a true partnership between DHS and the private sector to ensure the distribution of real-time cyber threat information in order to secure our nation in cyberspace without burdensome mandates or regulations.""[9]
McCaul is married to Linda Mays McCaul. She is the daughter of Clear Channel Communications chairman Lowry Mays and sister of its CEO Mark Mays. In 2011, Roll Call named McCaul the wealthiest member of the United States Congress, surpassing then U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA). His net worth was estimated at $294 million, which is approximately 300% higher than it was in the previous year ($74 million).[10] In 2004, Roll Call estimated his net worth at just $12 million. His wealth increase was due to large monetary transfers from his wife's family.[11] Michael and Linda live in the city of West Lake Hills, Texas which is a wealthy suburb of Austin, Texas with their children, daughters Caroline, Jewell, Avery, and Lauren, and a son, Michael.[citation needed]"

Conaway served in the United States Army from 1970 to 1972,[1] was an accountant and became a Certified Public Accountant in 1974, chief financial officer at a bank, and from 1981 to 1986 was the chief financial officer of Arbusto Energy Inc, an oil and gas exploration firm operated by George W. Bush.
Soon after Bush was elected governor of Texas, he appointed Conaway to the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, which regulates accountancy in Texas. He served on the board as a volunteer for seven years, the last five as chairman.[citation needed]
In 2006, Conaway voted against extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965.[2][3]
In January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the National Republican Congressional Committee. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.[4]
Conaway is one of the few Certified Public Accountants in Congress.
From 2003 through 2005, $14.7 billion in crop subsidies went to the congressional districts of members on the House Committee on Agriculture, an analysis by the non-partisan Environmental Working Group found. That was 42.4% of the total subsidies. Conaway is reported to have brought $322 million to his district.[5]
Conaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent Larry Combest stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican Randy Neugebauer. A few months later, the Texas Legislature redrew the state's districts in an effort engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the Lubbock-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich Permian Basin in part because Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick was from that area. This district is heavily Republican by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas. Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area (Glasscock County had voted 93.1 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008.
Conaway endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for president in 2008.[citation needed]
Conaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (73.7 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26.3 percent).[6]
Conaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014. He polled 107,752 votes (90.27 percent); his challenger, Ryan T. Lange, received 11,607 (9.72 percent).[7]
Conaway has long been friends with George W. Bush, and the two mixed in many of the same social circles in Midland[citation needed].
Conaway served on the Midland Independent School District Board from 1985 to 1988."

Granger was born in Greenville, Texas, and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, where she attended Eastern Hills High School, which recognized her as a Distinguished Eastern Hills High School Graduate in 1993.[2] She graduated from Texas Wesleyan University. She was elected to the Fort Worth city council in 1989 and was elected Mayor in 1991.
After the retirement of Congressman Pete Geren in 1996, both the Democratic and Republican parties worked to recruit Granger. Republicans were particularly bullish on their chances of winning the 12th. It had once been represented by Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright, but had been made significantly more affluent and Republican after the 1990 census. Granger made the decision to run as a Republican, much to the dismay of local GOP activists, who criticized Granger as being too liberal. She was elected by a wide margin, taking 56 percent of the vote over the Democrat Hugh Parmer, also a former Fort Worth mayor. She was handily reelected in 1998 and has only faced serious opposition oncein 2000. In 2008, Granger defeated Democratic challenger Tracey Smith with 67 percent of the vote.
In 2006, Granger was reelected to serve her sixth term in Congress. She was also elected Conference Vice Chair, the fourth-ranking position among House Republicans, in November 2006. She is currently Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommitee on State-Foreign Operations. She also sits on the United States House Committee on Appropriations's Subcommittee on Defense (the first woman to do so), and the Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Subcommittee. She has served as a House Deputy Whip also while in Congress.
Granger is the author of the book, What's Right About America, Celebrating Our Nation's Values.
In August 2007, Kay Granger Elementary School opened in far north Fort Worth in the Northwest Independent School District. A school named for Granger's mother - Mullendore Elementary - was opened several years earlier in North Richland Hills, Texas. The adjacent Kay Granger Park is maintained by the city.
On September 25, 2007, she publicly endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the primary race for the Republican Party presidential nomination.[3][dead link] She also took up the position of national co-chair of the campaign organization Women for Mitt, filling a vacancy left by the death of Jennifer Dunn.[4][dead link] In a statement to the press following her endorsement, she said that she had heard Romney speak and that ""I agreed with everything he said, in the order he said it.""
She is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Republican Institute.[5] and Southwestern University. She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Her own website posts an article from ""Conservative Quarterly"" that calls her ""a dependable vote for the leadership on most issues."" She is also a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee.
In 2003, Granger was given a 10 percent rating by NARAL and an 84 percent rating by the Christian Coalition of America.
Granger has also voted several times in favor of an amendment to the United States Constitution to make it a crime to physically desecrate the American flag. She also supports the Federal Marriage Amendment.
She was easily renominated in the March 2, 2010, Republican primary, having polled 70 percent of the ballots over intraparty rivals Mike Brasovan and Matthew E. Kelly.[6]
Interest Group Ratings: In many of the ratings of interest groups that are there, Rep. Granger has the larger percentage in typically conservative groups. For example, in the interest groups of Concerned Women for America and the Christian Coalition of America her ratings were higher. In contrast, groups such as the School Nutrition Association and the Peace Action had much lower support ratings from the Representative.
Recent Votes: For representative Granger her recent votes are as follows: -November 18, 2011 In a proposed Balanced Budget Amendment (and her most recent vote), she voted for the amendment. -November 16, 2011 In the National Right to Carry Act she also voted in favor of the act. -November 3, 2011 In the Public Disclosure of Bonuses and Golden Parachute bill, she voted against it.
In the house overall, the November 18 bill failed in the house while both the bills on November 16 and 3 were both approved. [7]
In 2012, after chairman of the Taiwanese defense committee Lin Yu-fang rejected calls for more F-16 fighters and said that only the F-35 could ensure Taiwan's security,[8] Granger offered a NDAA amendment that passed the House to offer only the much older F-16 fighter to Taiwan.[9][10]
In June 2013, Granger was among the leading Congressmen that aided in voting to pass an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The amendment should continue to restrict the Pentagon from entering into new contracts with Russias state arms broker Rosoboronexport.[11]
During her tenure, Granger has supported over $50 million in earmarks to infrastructure projects in Fort Worth, Texas that benefited the Trinity River Vision Authority, an organization headed by her son.[12]
Kay has three children and five grandchildren.[13]"

He has served since 1995, when the House seated its first Republican majority in forty years.
A Republican, Thornberry represents Texas's 13th congressional district, a GOP stronghold which stretches between the Oklahoma and New Mexico borders. It winds across the Panhandle into the South Plains, then runs east across the Red River Valley. Covering over 40,000 square miles (100,000km2), it is the second-largest district geographically in Texas and one of the largest (excluding at-large districts in Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska) in the country. It is even larger in area than thirteen states. The principal cities in the district are Amarillo and Wichita Falls.


His great-great-grandfather, Amos Thornberry, a Union Army veteran and staunch Republican, moved in the 1880s to Clay County, just east of Wichita Falls. A year after Amos died in 1925, his son bought the cattle ranch that Mac Thornberry, his brothers, and their father now run.[1]
Thornberry is a lifelong resident of Clarendon, some 60 miles (97km) east of Amarillo, in the heart of the 13th. His family has operated a ranch in the area since 1881. He received his Bachelor of Arts in history from Texas Tech University in Lubbock. He then obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.[2]
He served previously as a staffer to two other Texas Republican congressmen, Tom Loeffler and Larry Combest, and as deputy Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs under Ronald Reagan before he joined his brothers on the family ranch. He also practiced law in Amarillo.
Thornberry is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[3]
He currently serves as the Vice Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where he leads the Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats, and Capabilities. He also serves as a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.[4]
According to a 2013 POLITICO article, Thornberry is considered by most defense industry experts and House insiders to be the front runner to be the next chairman of the Armed Services Committee.[5] Thornberry has called massive cuts in defense spending preferable to any additional tax revenues.[6] And for the Pentagon to do more with less, for example by cutting pensions and health care for veterans.[7]
From the National Journal Congressional Almanac:
""In the House, Thornberry has compiled a solidly conservative voting record, though he has a pragmatic streak and is hardly the most ideological Republican in the Texas delegation. In keeping with his scholarly nature, his official website includes an essay explaining his philosophy and explaining his interest 'in continuing to push government to work smarter and more efficiently.'
Thornberry has often been at the forefront of security issues. In 2002, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, he played a key role in the establishment of the new Homeland Security Department. He took over in January 2011 as chairman of the Armed Services Committees terrorism panel, and Speaker John Boehner also asked him to lead an effort to develop a cyber security strategy for the country. Earlier, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, Thornberry criticized delays in integrating computer networks and intelligence analyses at the Homeland Security Department. He also has championed missile defense and called for better coordination of military space programs.
Thornberry was critical of President Barack Obamas arms control deal with Russia in 2010 for precluding the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear nations. But he can be more pragmatic than other defense hawks. He served on a bipartisan commission in 2007 that drew up recommendations for winning the war in Iraq with both lethal and non-lethal approaches, such as diplomacy and foreign aid. Despite his expertise on security matters, he lost his bid in 2009 to chair the full Armed Services Committee to Buck McKeon, R-Calif., who had more seniority.
On domestic issues, Thornberry has pressed for repeal of the estate tax and also tax credits to encourage production of oil in marginal wells. In 2010, he got a bill into law expanding access to state veterans homes to parents whose children died while serving in the military. He introduced a bill in January 2011 to help states set up special health care courts staffed by judges with expertise in the subject. The judges would serve as an alternative to juries that Republicans say are inclined to award unnecessarily large damage amounts in malpractice cases.""[8]
Thornberry has consistently voted for term limits that would apply to U.S. Congressmen. He has never said that he would limit the amount of terms he would serve until a Constitutional Amendment is passed limiting senators and representatives across the board. He is quoted as saying, ""The key is who are we working for? It doesn't matter if you've been in Washington two years or 25 years. We saw a huge number of incumbents lose in the last election because they forgot that. I don't work for the new speaker. I don't work for the party. I work for the 650,000 folks in my district. That's certainly the focus of mine.""[9]
With a long personal and family background in ranching, Thornberry has been a leading voice in the House of Representatives about the importance of passing a Farm Bill every five years to give farmers and ranchers more stability.[10] In 2013, he voted for the five year Farm Bill that failed in the House.[11]
The 2013 Farm Bill offered taxpayers close to $40 billion in savings, including reductions in farm policy spending and the repeal or consolidation of over 100 programs.[12] Those savings included annual cuts of $2 billion from food stamps, which would have been the most extensive reforms to food policy since 1996.[13]
From Jan 1995 to May 2013, Thornberry missed 124 of 12,475 roll call votes, which is 1.0%. This is better than the median of 2.3% among the lifetime records of representatives currently serving.[14]
Thornberry defeated Democratic Congressman Bill Sarpalius in the 1994 general election, a heavily Republican year nationwide. He polled 79,416 votes (55.41 percent) to Sarpalius' 63,923 votes (44.18 percent). Two years earlier in a much higher turnout election, Sarpalius had polled nearly double the votes that he received in 1994. The 13th has always been a somewhat conservative district, but on paper had been made somewhat less Republican in the 1990s redistricting. For this reason, Thornberry's victory is still regarded as an upset.
Thornberry has never faced another contest nearly as close as his initial one, and has been reelected 10 times, never dropping below 67 percent of the vote. He has consolidated his hold on a district that was historically Democratic as recently as the 1970s, and is now reckoned as one of the most Republican districts in the nation. Thornberry is only the third Republican to represent the district for a full term since Reconstruction. The previous Republican representatives were Robert D. ""Bob"" Price of Pampa (19671975) and Beau Boulter of Amarillo (19851989).
In the 2006 and 2008 elections, Thornberry handily defeated former intelligence officer and Professor Roger Waun.
In the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012, Thornberry overwhelmed his lone opponent, Pamela Lee Barlow, 47,251 votes (77.6 percent) to 13,643 (22.4 percent).[20] In the general election, Thornberry bested (91 percent) Libertarian John Robert Deek of Denton and Green Party candidate Keith F. Houston of Canyon (there was no Democratic candidate).[21]
In the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014, Thornberry easily won re-nomination to an eleventh term in Congress. He polled 45,097 votes (67.92 percent) to challengers Elaine Hays and, again, Pamela Barlow, who received 12,438 votes (18.7 percent) and 8,860 votes (13.3 percent), respectively.[22]"

He defeated former Congressman Nick Lampson on November 6, 2012, by a 53% to 45% margin. He was a member of the Texas House of Representatives, representing the 29th district. He is a member of the Republican Party.[2]


He graduated from Alvin Community College and in 1977 earned a BS in public affairs from the University of HoustonClear Lake. In 1981, he founded Weber's Air & Heat Air-Conditioning Company.[3]
He was a city councilman of Pearland, Texas for six years. In addition he served as Brazoria County Grand Jury Commissioner, Brazoria County Redistricting Committee, Texas Republican Party Convention delegate, president of Brazoria County Cities Association, member of the Brazoria County Republican Party, and chairman of the Pearland Area Republican Party Headquarters.[4]
After State Representative Glenda Dawson died on September 12, 2006,[5] a special election was held on December 19. Businessman Mike P. O'Day earned 48% of the vote, falling just short of the 50% threshold. Weber earned 28% of the vote, qualifying for the run-off.[6] In the January run-off, O'Day defeated him 57%-43%.[7]
O'Day decided to retire. Weber ran for the March 2008 primary and won with 59% of the vote.[8] He won the general election with 60% of the vote.[9] He won re-election to a second term in 2010 with 85% of the vote.[10]
After Republican U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas' 14th congressional district decided to retire, nine Republicans decided to run in the newly redrawn district. Weber received endorsements from Governor Rick Perry and Ron Paul. He ranked first with 28% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold. In the run-off, he defeated Pearland City Councilwoman Felicia Harris 62%-37%.[12] He defeated former Congressman Nick Lampson on November 6, 2012, by a 53% to 45% margin.[2] Based upon Weber's vote total in 2012, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball named Weber one of their ""Underachievers"" because he received only 53.5% of the vote in his Congressional district while Mitt Romney received 59.3%.[13]
In January 2014, during President Obama's State of the Union address, Weber in a tweet referred to the President as ""Kommandant-In-Chef"" [sic] and ""the Socialist dictator."" After the White House apologized for failing to send a more high profile leader to a demonstration in Paris following the January 2015 terrorist attacks in that city, Weber tweeted, ""Even Adolph [sic] Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris.""[14] Weber then wrote that he needed to ""apologize to all those offended by my tweet"". He did not choose to withdraw his earlier tweet made during the State of the Union address.[14]

Rubn E. Hinojosa (born August 20, 1940) is the U.S. Representative for Texas's 15th congressional district, serving since 1997. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district stretches from Seguin (east of San Antonio), to McAllen on the Mexican border. Much of the region is rural, although Hidalgo County is part of the third fastest growing metropolitan statistical area in the country. He serves on the Financial Services and Education committees.


Hinojosa was born in Edcouch, Texas. The eighth of 11 children, Hinojosa was raised in Hidalgo County, which borders on Mexico, and earned two business degrees at the University of Texas.[1] He earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his MBA from the University of Texas-Pan American. He served as president and chief financial officer of his family's food processing company, H&H Foods, for twenty years. President Reagan named H&H the Number One Minority-Owned Business in America in 1983. In 1987 the U.S. Small Business Administration named the Hinojosas Minority Entrepreneur of the Year.[2]
By 1994, the company was one of the major employers in the Rio Grande area, with 350 employees, and had begun to produce ready-to-eat foods. In 2005 it had $40 million in revenue but had 270 employees.[3]
In 1974, he was elected to the Texas State Board of Education, serving for ten years.
Hinojosas father and uncle founded H&H Foods in 1947 as a slaughterhouse. Control of the firm passed to himself and his brother, Liborio, in 1976. He gave up his executive position when he entered Congress, but remained a director and major stockholder.[4]
After 32-year incumbent Kika de la Garza announced his retirement, Hinojosa won a five-way primary for the seat by only 588 votes. This practically assured him of being only the sixth person to represent this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district. He defeated Republican Tom Haughey with 62% of the vote. He defeated Haughey again in 1998, winning 59% of the vote. In 2000 he took 89% of the vote, facing only independent Frank L. Jones III. In 2002, he was reelected unopposed. In 2004, Hinojosa faced Republican Michael Thamm in the redrawn District 15 and defeated the former major, winning with 59 percent of the vote. In the 2006 mid-term election he faced Paul Haring and Eddie Zamora, both Republicans. Hinojosa won 61 percent of the vote in the once-again redrawn district.[6]
In the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014, Hinojosa again faces the Republican Eddie Zamora, who received 7,776 votes (54.9 percent) in the primary election held on March 4. Douglas A. ""Doug"" Carlile (born c. 1963) polled the remaining 6,393 ballots (45.1 percent).[7]
Hinojosa has been called as a hard-core liberal and a rank-and-file Democrat.[8][9] The 'That's My Congress' website has given Hinojosa a Liberal Action Score of 37/100 and a Conservative Action Score of 16/100 for his votes in the 112th Congress.[10][11]
During the 111th Congress, Hinojosa voted with his party 99 percent of the time. He voted to extend the Patriot Act and supported the 2011 budget compromise. He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as, ""Obamacare"", the American Clean Energy and Security Act, otherwise known as, Cap and Trade, [11] and the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[10]
Hinojosa has emphasized assisting minorities and low-income Americans gain access to higher education. He has been especially active in supporting water-conservation projects along the Mexican border, and in replacing federal subsidies for student loans with direct government loans. Hinojosa and George Miller were responsible for constructing the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which increased the maximum Pell Grants available to low-income students and authorized additional funding for minority-serving schools.
He co-sponsored a 2010 bill for enhanced border security, but has opposed the construction of a wall along the border.
He has also been a very strong supporter of free-trade agreements, and was one of 15 House Democrats to vote for the 2005 Central American Free Trade Agreement.[1]
Hinojosa supported the introduction, in 2010, of full-body scanners at Valley International Airport. He said that we need to take more precautions when it comes to public safety, and that the new technology gives TSA employees a distinct advantage in the prevention of terrorist events.[12]
In June 2011, Hinojosa introduced legislation that would expand the authority of NADBank, which had already funded more than 100 projects to prevent the release of untreated sewage into the Rio Grande and other bodies of water, to finance infrastructure projects designed to enhance economic development along the border and raise environmental standards.[13]
He has also supported measures to aid undocumented workers. He backed the AgJobs bill aimed at helping undocumented farm workers. He has been an advocate of the DREAM Act, which would provide citizenship to people who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents.[1][14] He cited his concern that these children came to the US alongside their parents and should not be faulted. Hinojosa argued that [o]ur country is much better off by being able to let those children get a college education and serve in the military and contribute to the prosperity of our country.[15]
J. M. Lozano, Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives from Kingsville in Kleberg County, for a time worked on Hinojosa's staff in McAllen beginning in 2003. At the time Lozano was a Democrat.[16]
Hinojosa is married to Martha Lopez Hinojosa and they have two daughters, Kaitlin and Karen. He has one son, Ruben Jr., and two daughters from a previous marriage.
Hinojosa declared personal bankruptcy in December 2010. He had $2.9 million in debts, mostly owed to Wells Fargo Bank. Hinojosa's bankruptcy stems from his personal guarantee of a loan made to his family's food processing company, H&H Foods."

He was elected in November 2012, defeating incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the Democratic primary, and Republican Barbara Carrasco in the general election.[2][3] The district includes most of El Paso. Prior to his election to Congress, O'Rourke was the District 8 representative on the El Paso city council from June 2005 to June 2011.


O'Rourke is a fourth-generation El Paso native. His father is former El Paso County Judge Pat O'Rourke. He attended Mesita Elementary and El Paso High School. In the early 1990s, Beto was a singer and guitarist in the band Foss. Foss included Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocalist for At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta) on vocals and drums, Arlo Klahr on vocals and guitar, and Mike Stevens on vocals and guitar. They released a self-titled demo and a 7"" record, ""The El Paso Pussycats"", on Western Breed Records in 1993. They released a subsequent album, ""Fewel St."" in 1994, also on Western. Foss toured the U.S. and Canada in the summer of 1993 and again, along with Bixler's concurrent band, Los Dregtones, in the summer of 1994. In 1995, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in English literature from Columbia University in New York City.[4] He was arrested in 1995 on burglary charges, and in 1998 on drunken driving charges.[5][6]
O'Rourke spent three years working at Internet start-ups in New York City before his return to El Paso in 1998.[citation needed]
In mid-2005, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council, and defeated two-term incumbent City Councilman Anthony Cobos, 57%-43%.[7][8]
O'Rourke is one of the youngest representatives to have ever served on the City Council.[9] In 2007, he won re-election to a second term defeating Trini Acevedo, 70%-30%.[10][11]
In August 2005, a resolution was drafted by O'Rourke and fellow council member Steve Ortega, calling on city officials to discourage the anti-illegal immigrant Minutemen from patrolling the local stretch of the Texas-Mexico border and ""reject civilian attempts to enforce immigration law."" The Minutemen's spokesman Shannon McGauley said his group planned to go ahead with October operations in El Paso, despite the resolution.[citation needed]
In 2006 there was a failed attempt to recall O'Rourke over an El Paso Downtown Redevelopment plan. South Side activist Carmen Felix initiated a recall petition drive against him on May 3, 2006. Despite the threat of recall, O'Rourke continued to strongly advocate the use of eminent domain in conjunction with the plan to redevelop downtown El Paso. At the El Paso city council meeting held on July 9, 2006, still under threat of recall, he showed a distinct change in tone toward the El Paso Downtown Revitalization Plan. He responded to a question posed by fellow city councilman Lozano as to whether residents displaced by new construction ""could come back to the area"", responding in assurance that the city would make ""every effort"" to ensure displaced residents were allowed to remain in their same neighborhoods.[citation needed]
On September 5, 2006, lawyers for the Land Grab Opponents of El Paso filed an ethics complaint with the City of El Paso alleging O'Rourke ""violated his fiduciary duty to the citizens of El Paso.""[12] According to the complaint, O'Rourke stands to benefit from his relationship with the Paso del Norte Group because his firm does business with the group, stating ""O'Rourke is impermissibly entangled in the Paso del Norte Group's Downtown Revitalization Plan, through both family and business ties.""[12]
The complaint alleged that O'Rourke's company, Stanton Street Technology Group, provides Internet and Information Technology services to the Paso del Norte Group. Despite these ties, O'Rourke voted to extend the group's contract with the city last year and to accept the group's redevelopment proposal in March, according to the complaint. The city's Ethics Review Commission summarily dismissed the first complaint on October 12, 2006. The second complaint was dismissed on October 18, 2006. The Land Grab Opponents' lawyer stated that his intent in filing the ethics complaints was to make O'Rourke recuse himself from debating and voting on the Downtown plan because O'Rourke's father-in-law, William Sanders, is a leader in the Paso del Norte Group[13] which advanced the plan. The Land Grab Opponents' lawyer cited the business relationship between Paso del Norte Group and O'Rourke's Stanton Street Technologies. In the second ethics complaint, the lawyer pointed to evidence he said suggests that the CFO of Sanders' company, The Verde Group, prepared O'Rourke's income tax return this year. O'Rourke abstained at from the meeting on the establishment of a Downtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone.[citation needed]
In January 2009, O'Rourke sponsored a resolution asking the federal government to rethink the war on drugs and initiate an ""open and honest debate"" about ending the prohibition of illegal drugs. The resolution, which was unanimously supported by his colleagues on the El Paso City Council was vetoed by the Mayor, and spurred a larger national discussion on the topic. He told reporters that the reason he decided to speak up about what he called the failed war on drugs was the thousands of people who have been killed in the drug war in the adjoining city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. ""I hope it has all had its intended affect of starting the national discussion of the wisdom of the war on drugs  and probably more importantly, helping to bring about a better solution than the status quo, which has led to the terror and tragedy in Juarez.""[14]
In 2012, Beto ran against eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes for Texas' 16th congressional district in the Democratic primarythe real contest in this heavily Democratic, majority-Latino district. O'Rourke took 50.5 percent of the vote, just a few hundred votes above the threshold required to avoid a runoff.[15] He defeated his Republican opponent, Barbara Carrasco, in the general election with 65 percent of the vote. He is one of three white Democrats from Texas in the 113th Congress, the others being Lloyd Doggett and Gene Green.[citation needed] He is also one of seven non-Latino Democrats from Texas, the others being Doggett, Green, Marc Veasey, Sheila Jackson Lee, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Al Green.[citation needed]
Beto's first sponsored bill was introduced on April 8, 2013. The bill was H.R. 1265, which required the continuation of tuition assistance programs for members of the Armed Forces for the remainder of fiscal year 2013. This bill was not passed into law.[citation needed]
H.R. 2036 was introduced by O'Rourke on June 6 of the same year. H.R. 2036, also known as the Foster Children Opportunity Act, would require state plans for foster care and adoption assistance to have procedures to assist alien children in the child welfare system achieve special immigrant juvenile status and create a process for those children to become U.S. citizens by the time they exited foster care. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, and Nutrition, where it is awaiting a vote.[citation needed]
O'Rourke married Amy Hoover Sanders, the daughter of William and Louann Sanders of El Paso, on September 24, 2005 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Beto and Amy O'Rourke have three children.[4]"

""Bill"" Flores (born February 25, 1954) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Texas's 17th congressional district since 2011. The district, located in the middle of the state, includes Waco, College Station and Bryan.[2] He is a member of the Republican Party and the former CEO of Phoenix Exploration Company, an oil and natural gas exploration company.


Flores was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming at the F.E. Warren Air Force Base, where his father was serving in the military. He is the son of Ruth Ann Theresa (ne Kennedy) and Joe Pete Flores, who is Hispanic.[3] Flores grew up in Stratford, Texas in the Texas Panhandle.[4] He graduated with a B.B.A., cum laude in accounting from Texas A&M University in 1976.[5] While there, he was a member of the Corps of Cadets, the Ross Volunteer Company,[6] and Corps Staff. He also served as Student Body Vice-President of Finance during his senior year.[citation needed] He has been a licensed Certified Public Accountant since 1978.[7] He also received an MBA from Houston Baptist University in 1985.[5]
Flores served as CFO for two publicly traded energy service firms from 1990 through 1998. These companies included Marine Drilling Companies, Inc. (19901997) and Western Atlas Inc. (19971998). From 2002 to 2005, Flores was the Senior Vice President and CFO of Gryphon Exploration Company.[8]
During his time with Marine Drilling he personally oversaw Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of Marine Rig 200, Inc. which resulted in a $7.5 million loss to the federal government.[9]
In 2006, a group of five oil and gas industry executives, led by Flores as President and CEO, formed Phoenix Exploration Company with $350 million of capital commitments from a group of private equity firms that included Soros Strategic Partners LP and HNBridge LP. The company is engaged in oil and gas exploration along the Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico shelf utilizing regional 3-D seismic data.[10] Flores also served as a Director of that company from its formation until he retired in December 2009 to run for public office.[citation needed]
Flores is a former Commissioner of the Texas Real Estate Commission,[11] and a past Director and former Chairman of the Board of the Association of Former Students of Texas A&M University.[7] He has also served on boards of Phoenix Exploration Company, Marine Drilling Companies, Inc.,[12] FreeBirds, Inc., and The PARC, Inc, and the Alley Theater of Houston.[7]
He serves on the Board of the Private Enterprise Research Center of Texas A&M University and as a member of the Board of Trustees of Houston Baptist University.[5]
In late 2009 Flores entered the Republican primary for the 17th District, held by 10-term Democratic incumbent Chet Edwards.[13] Flores claimed his worries about the future of ""the American dream"" inspired him to run for Congress.[5] He committed a half million dollars of his own money to self-fund his campaign.[14]
In the Republican primary runoff on April 13, he had defeated Rob Curnock[15] by a 64-36 percent margin.[16] The size of his primary victory was a surprise to many political observers because Curnock was the 2008 nominee and he held Edwards' 2008 vote total close to 50 percent, despite being heavily outspent.[17] During the Republican primary, Flores received the endorsement of former Republican U.S. Senator Phil Gramm[18] After the primary win, Flores was also endorsed by George H.W. Bush, John McCain,[19] Mitt Romney, and Mike Huckabee.[5]
Through December 21, 2010, Flores' campaign raised $3.5 million, of which $1.49 million came from Flores himself. He spent $3.3 million overall.[20]
On November 2, 2010, Flores defeated Edwards with 62 percent of the vote.[21][22][23] This was the largest margin of defeat for a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle.[citation needed]
Upon his swearing-in, Flores became the first Republican to represent Waco in Congress since Reconstruction.[citation needed] Flores supports limited government and lower taxes[citation needed]; an end to the spending of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act[citation needed]; making the Bush-era tax cuts permanent[citation needed]; pro-life abortion positions[citation needed]; and stronger enforcement at the U.S. Mexico border.[24] Flores supports the building of new nuclear power plants to assist the U.S. in becoming energy self-sufficient.[citation needed] He also supports incentives for the development of solar and wind power.[25] He is a member of the Conservative Republican Study Committee and the Congressional Hispanic Conference.
On November 18, 2014, Flores was elected to the Chairmanship of the House Republican Study Committee(RSC). Flores was elected on the second ballot securing 84 votes to South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney's 57.
Flores is married to Gina, whom he met in high school.[4] They have two sons.[29] Flores attends Central Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist church in Bryan.[30]
Flores has served as a member of the Mays Business School Advisory Board, the Corps of Cadets Development Council, Corps of Cadets Association, the Houston A&M Club, the Brazos County A&M Club, and other roles at Texas A&M University.[7] In 2003, he was honored as an outstanding alumnus of the Mays Business School of Texas A&M University.[29] In 2010, he was also named a distinguished alumnus by Texas A&M University.[6]"

In 1994, Jackson Lee challenged four-term incumbent U.S. Congressman Craig Washington in the Democratic primary.[3] Washington had come under fire for opposing several projects that would have benefited the Houston area.[6] Jackson Lee defeated Washington in a rout, taking 63% to Washington's 37%.[7] The victory was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. In the general election, she defeated Republican nominee Jerry Burley 73%-24%.[8]
During this time period, Jackson Lee was never challenged in the Democratic primary. She won re-election during this time with at least 76% of the vote.[9]
For the first time in her congressional career, Jackson Lee was challenged in the Democratic primary; her opponents were Houston City Councilmember Jarvis Johnson and Sean Roberts. She defeated them 67%-28%-5%.[10]
It was reported that in October 2010 Jackson Lee was asking the Department of Justice to investigate whether tea party groups are intimidating black and Hispanic voters in her district. She requested that Attorney General Eric Holder send poll monitors to make sure that a local group wasn't stopping people from voting.[11]
She won the general election with 70% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage of her career.[12]
In 2012, Jackson Lee was not challenged in the Democratic primary and won the general election with 75% of the vote.[13]

The Huffington Post and Houston Chronicle reported that she had gone through 11 chiefs of staff in 11 years.[15][16] In 2011 she was named as one of the ""worst bosses in Washington"" by ""Daily Caller"" [17] The Huffington Post stated that ""Jackson Lee regularly appears on Washingtonian magazine's list of the Best and Worst of Congress as the meanest member of House of Representatives."" [15][18] That reputation as the worst boss on Capital Hill continued;in 2012 Washingtonian again listed her as the meanest member of the House,[19] a report in 2013 concluded that ""the veteran Texas Democrat had the highest turnover rate for all of Congress over the past decade."" [20]
In 2000, she favored permanently normalizing trade status for China, arguing that it would aid both human rights and Houston's economy.[21]
Jackson Lee traveled to the 2001 World Conference against Racism in South Africa, and has backed sanctions against Sudan.[22] On April 28, 2006, Jackson Lee, along with four other members of Congress and six other activists, was arrested for disorderly conduct in front of Sudan's embassy in Washington. They were protesting the role of Sudan's government in ethnic cleansing in Darfur.[23]
Jackson Lee has urged better relations between the U.S. and Venezuela, which she describes as a friendly nation. She said the U.S. should reconsider its ban on selling F-16 fighter jets and spare parts to that country. The U.S. State Department bans such sales due to ""lack of support"" for counter-terrorist operations and Venezuela's relations with Iran and Cuba.[24][25]
In July 2010 Jackson Lee said: ""Today, we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working. We may not agree with all that North Vietnam is doing, but they are living in peace. I would look for a better human rights record for North Vietnam, but they are living side by side.[26] It was noted that Vietnam had not been split for four decades.[27][28]
Jackson Lee is active on immigration issues.[29] She has proposed increasing border security and increasing opportunities for legalization among those living in the United States. She has opposed a guest worker program, saying that the idea of guest: ""connotate[s] `invite, come,' and, at the same time, it misleads because you ask people to come for a temporary job of three to six years and they have to leave if they don't have another job and I would think that they would not.""[30]
Speaking in July 2010 at the NAACP national convention, Jackson Lee compared the Tea Party to the KKK.[31]
Jackson Lee said in January 2011 that repealing the health care law would be in violation of the Constitution.

Texas Tech University
Robert Randolph ""Randy"" Neugebauer[2] (born December 24, 1949), is the U.S. Representative for Texas's 19th congressional district, having served since a special election in 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes a large swath of West Texas, including Lubbock and Abilene. According to a 2011 survey by the National Journal, Neugebauer is ""the most conservative"" member of the House.[3]


Neugebauer (pronounced NAG AH BOWER) was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and reared in Lubbock. His father was an insurance salesman and his mother a real estate agent and interior designer. He has two brothers, Jon and Bradley, and a sister, Virginia Volpe.[4] When Randy was nine years old, his parents divorced, and his father died soon thereafter. In 1963, his mother married Joe W. Smith, a bank manager.[5] Neugebauer graduated from Coronado High School and later from Texas Tech University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from the College of Business Administration (now Rawls College of Business).[6]
Like his mother, Neugebauer has long been involved in the real estate business, having served as president of the development company Lubbock Land before his election to Congress. He is a former president of the Texas Association of Builders from 1996 to 1997.[6]
From 1992 to 1998, Neugebauer was a Lubbock city councilman. He was mayor pro tempore from 1994 to 1996. While involved in Lubbock government, Neugebauer worked to reduce taxes and to privatize municipal services.
On March 21, 2010, during the debate in the House of Representatives of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Neugebauer yelled out ""Baby killer!""[7] The remark was believed to have been directed at Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, a leader of the anti-abortion Democrats in the House, who was discussing a motion filed by the Republicans. While immediate inquiries began to determine who shouted the words, more than 12 hours later, on March 22, 2010, Neugebauer publicly identified himself as the person, apologized for the incident and argued that his words were ""It's a baby killer"", referring to the bill, not Stupak himself.[8][9]
However, reporters and others in the room insisted Neugebauer precisely shouted Baby killer!"", referring to Stupak.[10] Stupak said that he does not buy Neugebauer's description of the outburst, said his words were very clear, and believes Neugebauer should apologize for his remark on the floor of the US House.[11][12] In contrast to Neugebauer's ""baby killer"" comment, Stupak and the Politifact watchdog group agree, ""there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation"" that Neugebauer detests.[13]
The New York Times and Colorado Springs Gazette have compared Neugebauer's comment to Joe Wilson shouting ""You lie!"" during President Barack Obama's September 2009 address to Congress, and to racial and sexual slurs said to have been shouted at Democratic legislators outside the Capitol building by members of the public who opposed the bill during the 48 hours preceding Neugebauer's March 21, 2010, outburst.[14][15][16] Neugebauer's comment was covered by media worldwide, including Canada's Macleans magazine,[17] the United Kingdom's The Times,[18] and Australia's Sydney Morning Herald.[19]
Neugebauer has sponsored the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1155; 113th Congress) (H.R. 1155), a bill meant to reduce the regulatory costs of complying with multiple states' requirements for insurance companies, making it easier for the same corporation to operate in multiple states.[20] The bill would transform the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) into a clearing house that set up its own standards that insurance companies would be required to meet in order to do business in other states.[20] In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities).[20]
Proponents of the bill argued that it would help lower costs for insurance companies and make insurance cheaper for people to buy. It passed the House on September 10, 2013.[21]
On April 26, 2013, Neugebauer introduced the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2014 (H.R. 1786; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP), which was created to improve the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and to develop measures to reduce the damage they cause.[22][23]
On October 2, 2013, during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Neugebauer publicly scolded a National Park Service ranger who was enforcing the agency's closure of the National World War II Memorial due to the lapse in appropriations.[24][25] His actions were widely criticized in the media,[26][27][28][29][30][31] and he has responded that his words were taken out of context.[32][24]
Neugebauer was elected to Congress after a hotly contested special election runoff in the spring of 2003. The seat came open after 18-year Republican incumbent Larry Combest announced his retirement not long after having been reelected to a 10th term in 2002. The 19th is one of the most conservative areas of Texas (indeed, in the entire nation), and it was taken for granted that Combest would be succeeded by another Republican, though at the time Combest had been the only Republican to have represented the 19th District.[33]
Neugebauer finished first in the crowded seven-way, all-Republican field. However, as he finished well short of a majority, he forced into a second round of balloting with fellow Republican Mike Conaway of Midland, the chairman of the Texas Board of Public Accountancy and a friend of President George W. Bush. In a close third-place finish in the first round of balloting was then-State Representative Carl Isett of Lubbock. In the runoff election, Neugebauer defeated Conaway by only 587 votes, becoming only the fourth person to represent the 19th since its creation in 1935. Soon afterward in 2004, Conaway won election to Congress in the newly reconfigured Texas' 11th congressional district.
Neugebauer ran for a full term in 2004, facing 26-year incumbent Democrat Charles Stenholm of Abilene. Stenholm had previously represented the Abilene-based Texas' 17th congressional district, but that district had been dismantled in the 2003 Texas redistricting. The largest chunk of Stenholm's former territory was thrown into Neugebauer's district. Although Stenholm had more seniority, the new district retained about 60 percent of Neugebauer's former territory. Neugebauer won by 18 points, and has been reelected four more times with little substantive opposition.
In the 2010 Texas House of Representatives election, Neugebauer supported the election of the conservative Jim Landtroop to the District 85 seat. Landtroop had worked in past Neugebauer campaigns and is a member of the congressman's campaign finance committee. Landtroop upset the Democratic incumbent Joseph P. Heflin of Crosbyton[34] but was himself unseated after one term in a revised district by Republican Ken King of Canadian in Hemphill County.
Neugebauer faced opposition in the May 29 Republican primary from Chris Winn, who resigned as the Lubbock County Republican chairman to enter the race.[35] Neugebauer defeated Winn, 45,372 (74.3%) to 15,675 (25.7%).[36]
In December 2013, Chris Winn announced that he would again challenge Neugebauer in the Republican primary scheduled for March 4, 2014. A third Lubbock Republican also filed for the seat, Donald R. May, a retired retinal surgeon.[37]Neugebauer easily won re-nomination to a seventh term in the House. He polled 39,584 votes (64.4 percent); May and Winn trailed with 14,486 votes (23.6 percent) and 7,422 (12.1 percent), respectively.[38]
During the first seven years of his political career, from 2003 to February 2010, he has raised $6.4 million, most of these funds coming from the oil and gas, real estate, commercial banking and crop production/processing industries, and leadership PACs.[39][40] His largest corporate and association donors have been the National Auto Dealers Association, National Association of Home Builders, Quantum Energy Partners, the National Beer Wholesalers Association and the National Association of Realtors.[41] Outspoken against abortion during Congress' debate on health care reform legislation, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Neugebauer has received a total of $3,000 during his career from people and committees associated with pro-life groups.[42]
Neugebauer married his high school sweetheart, the former Dana Collins, and they have two sons, Todd Neugebauer, President of Aspect Holdings, LLC,[43] and Toby Neugebauer, the co-CEO of Quantum Energy Partners. They also have four grandchildren.[44] As of 2010, Neugebauer served as a deacon at a Southern Baptist church.[45]"

His father was a retired teacher from the Edgewood Independent School District, and his mother, a community activist. He graduated with honors from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and communications and went on to earn a juris doctor with his twin brother at Harvard Law School.[4] After law school, the two brothers continued together to work for the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld before starting their own firm in 2005.[5]

He was initially set to challenge fellow Democrat and nine-term incumbent Lloyd Doggett, whose home in Austin had been drawn into the district, in the Democratic primary[11] However, on November 28, after Charlie Gonzalez of the neighboring 20th District announced his retirement after seven terms, Castro announced his intent to run instead for the 20th District seat. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Democratic, Hispanic-majority district. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, he introduced his brother Julin as keynote speaker.[9] In November 2012, Castro defeated Republican David Rosa 64%-34%.[12] becoming only the fifth person to represent this district since its creation in 1935.
Castro was officially sworn into office on January 3, 2013 becoming a member of the 113th United States Congress. He was chosen as the president of the freshman class of Democrats in the 113th Congress.[13]

The district includes most of the wealthier sections of San Antonio and Austin, as well as some of the Texas Hill Country. He sponsored the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act (PCIP). He also co-sponsored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.[1]


Smith graduated from T.M.I.: The Episcopal School of Texas (1965), Yale University (1969), and Southern Methodist University Law School (1975).[2]
In 1969, he was hired as a management intern by the Small Business Administration in Washington, D.C.[2] He was a business and financial writer for the Christian Science Monitor (197072).[2] He was admitted to the Texas bar in 1975 and went into private practice in San Antonio with the firm of Maebius and Duncan, Inc.[2]
In 1978, he was elected chairman of the Republican Party of Bexar County. In 1980, Smith was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Bexar County, the 57th District. He served on the Energy Resources Committee and the Fire Ants Select Committee.[3] In 1982, he was elected to the 3rd Precinct of the Bexar County Commission.[citation needed]
In 1986, four-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Tom Loeffler of Texas' 21st congressional district decided to retire to run for governor of Texas. Smith led a crowded six-way primary with 31% of the vote[4] and then defeated Van Archer in the run-off election 54%46%.[5] He won the general election with 61% of the vote.[6]
During this time period, he never won re-election with less than 72% of the vote.
Smith's district was significantly altered in the 2003 Texas redistricting. While he lost most of the Hill Country to the 23rd District, he picked up a significant portion of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas, a traditional bastion of liberalism. Smith won re-election with 62% of the vote, Smith's lowest winning percentage since his initial run in 1986.[7]
In 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States threw out the 23rd District in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry on the grounds that it violated the rights of Latino voters. The 23rd is the largest district in the nation (not counting the at-large districts), stretching across 800 road miles from El Paso to San Antonio. Due to its size, nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn. Smith regained most of the Hill Country, but kept a large portion of his share of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas.
In November 2006 the Texas Legislative Council [8] found that nearly two-thirds of voters in District 21 cast ballots for statewide Republican candidates in 2004. In the November 2006 open election, Smith faced six candidates. He defeated Democrats John Courage and Gene Kelly 60%24%-9%.[9][10] This was Smith's lowest winning percentage of his career.
He only faced one candidate, Libertarian nominee James Arthur Strohm, and defeated him with 80% of the vote.[11]
He faced two candidates, Democratic nominee Lainey Melnick and Libertarian nominee James Arthur Strohm, and won with 69% of the vote.[12]
Smith faced five challengers in the 2012 general election on November 6, 2012: Candace Duval (Dem), John-Henry Liberty (Lib), Fidel Castillo (Grn), Bill Stout (Grn), and Carlos Pena (Ind).[13] He won the race with 63% of the vote.[14]
Smith won re-nomination to fifteenth House term in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He received 40,262 votes (60.4 percent). His runner-up was Matt McCall, with 22,596 votes (33.9 percent). Michael J. Smith polled the remaining 3,772 votes (5.7 percent).[15]
Smith has consistently supported restrictions on abortion. In 2009, Smith voted to prohibit federally funded abortions.[16] In 2006, Smith voted for the Abortion Pain Bill, which would ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child,[17] and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which would prohibit taking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the involvement of parents in abortion decisions.[18] In 2008, the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion-rights advocacy group,[19] gave Representative Smith a rating of 100 on a point system in which points were assigned for actions in support of legislation they described as pro-life.[20]
On April 23, 2006 CNET reported that Smith was introducing a bill that ""would expand the DMCA's restrictions on software that can bypass copy protections and grant federal police more wiretapping and enforcement powers"".[21] The move sparked a negative response among technology enthusiasts in opposition to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
On June 23, 2011, H.R. 2306 was introduced to Congress by Barney Frank and co-signer Ron Paul.[22] The intent of the bill was to end the Federal prohibition on cannabis, turning over the regulation of marijuana to states (similar to alcohol). The bill was the first of its kind since prohibition began. H.R. 2306 would limit federal powers to interstate transfer; while laws for cultivation, sales, use, and taxation would be determined by each state. This bill was well received by the public, especially medical marijuana patients and activists.[citation needed]
Lamar Smith informed reporters that he had no intention of considering the bill or providing it with a hearing. With Smith's position as chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, he has great influence on what bills will be considered.
Smith stated that ""Marijuana use and distribution is prohibited under federal law because it has a high potential for abuse and does not have an accepted medical use in the U.S., The Food and Drug Administration has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease"".[23] According to the National Cancer Institute, ""Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the laboratory and the clinic for relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite"", though ""there is not enough evidence to recommend that patients inhale or ingest Cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms or side effects of cancer therapy"".[24] Smith also stated that ""Decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to millions more Americans becoming addicted to drugs and greater profits for drug cartels who fund violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. Allowing states to determine their own marijuana policy flies in the face of Supreme Court precedent"".[23]
On June 24, 2011, Lamar Smith's Facebook page was flooded with protests from citizens, asking him to change his position on the bill and calling for a fair hearing. Smith's Facebook page was temporarily taken down soon after, to be returned void of all comments related to H.R. 2306 and with future comments disabled.[25] The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) encouraged MMJ patients and activists to contact Smith via his phone, which was soon turned to an automatic answering machine, stating the office was closed.[25]
In 2011 Smith had received $37,250 in campaign contributions from the Beer, Wine and Liquor Lobby,[26][clarification needed] and $65,800 total between 2009 and 2011. He received more than $133,000 from the Content Industry, including Industry groups and individual companies through mid-2011. Another $60,000 was donated by these companies in the 2012 Election Cycle.[27] Maplight.org listed the Beer, Wine, and Liquor Lobby as third among Smith's top ten campaign contributors, and Content Industry as #1.[28]
In 2011 Smith co-sponsored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, a bill that made significant changes to the U.S. patent system.[1] The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on September 16, 2011.[29] The law will switch U.S. rights to a patent from the present first-to-invent system to a first inventor-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013.[30][31]
On November 20, 2013, Smith introduced the Space Launch Liability Indemnification Extension Act (H.R. 3547; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend until December 31, 2014, the current limitation on liability of commercial space launch companies.[32] Under the current system, the space launch company is liable for any damages up to $500 million, after which the U.S. Government will pay the damages in the range of $500 million to $2.7 billion. Above $2.7 billion, the company is again responsible.[33]
On July 8, 2014, Smith introduced the STEM Education Act of 2014 (H.R. 5031; 113th Congress), a bill that would add computer science to the definition of STEM fields used by the United States federal government in determining grants and education funding.[34][35] Smith said that ""we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation's youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.""[36]
On October 26, 2011, Smith introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act (H.R. 3261), also known as SOPA.[37] The bill sought to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods. SOPA faced significant opposition from internet freedom advocacy groups and web companies, and on January 15, 2012, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor cancelled a planned vote on the bill.[38][39][40]
On May 25, 2011, Smith introduced the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011, which sought to change sentencing rules and mandated that ISPs keep logs of customer data (such as name, IP addresses, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers) for at least a year.[41] Representative Zoe Lofgren, (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) criticized PCIP. Lofgren said a better name would be ""Keep Every Americans' Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act"". Conyers said the bill would allow use of the information for purposes entirely unrelated to fighting child pornography.[41][42]
Smith is a signer of Americans for Tax Reforms Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[43]
Smith currently serves as chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology for the 113th Congress, having replaced Ralph Hall.[44] Smith has previously served on the Committee on Homeland Security, Committee on the Judiciary (Chairman), the Republican Study Committee, and the Tea Party Caucus.
On January 30, 2015, law360 reported that Smith has sent letters to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and to the chief technology officer at the White House Office of Science, asking for an explanation of media claims of HealthCare.gov sharing private data supplied by subscribers with third-parties such as Google, Twitter. and YouTube.[45]
Smith is a Christian Scientist. In 1992, he married Elizabeth Lynn Schaefer,[46] a Christian Science practitioner and teacher, as was his first wife, Jane Shoultz, before her death in 1991.[47] They have two children, Nell Seeligson (born 1976) and Tobin Wells (born 1979), from his previous marriage."
"382","","2009","1962","Texas 22","Rice University
University of Texas at Austin","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Olson","Pete Olson","Republican","Congressional aide","United Methodist","Peter Graham ""Pete"" Olson (born December 9, 1962) is the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district, serving since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes much of southeastern Houston, as well as most of the city's southern suburbs such as Pearland and Sugar Land.


Peter Graham Olson was born on December 9, 1962 in Fort Lewis, Washington. In 1972, Olson moved with his family to Seabrook, Texas,[1] a southeast suburb of Houston; and attended public schools, graduating from Clear Lake High School in 1981. In 1985, Olson graduated from Rice University, where he played college basketball his freshman year, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science.[1] Upon graduation, Olson enrolled in law school at the University of Texas at Austin. He completed the Texas Bar Exam in 1988 and joined the United States Navy.
Olson served in the United States Navy for nine years. He entered the Navy in 1988, and earned his Naval Aviator wings in March 1991. After earning his wings as a P-3C Orion pilot, post-Gulf War, he flew missions over the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific.[1] In 1994, he was assigned as a Naval liaison to the United States Senate, during which time he assisted Republican U.S. Senator Phil Gramm on several overseas trips.[1]
After leaving active military duty, he joined Senator Gramm's staff in 1998. After Gramm's retirement from the Senate in 2002, Olson served as Chief of Staff to Gramm's successor, U.S. senator and former Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, from December 2002 until May 2007.[2]
Olson defeated incumbent Democratic Representative Nick Lampson in the general election on November 4, 2008. Olson received 53% of the vote and Lampson received 45%.[3][4] Olson had won the Republican nomination by defeating former Congresswoman Shelley Sekula-Gibbs in the April 8, 2008, run-off election.[5][6] Democratic candidate Nick Lampson won in 2006 when the 11-term Republican incumbent, former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, was indicted. DeLay's resignation came too late for another Republican to replace him on the ballot, so Lampson defeated a Republican running as a write-in candidate.
An October 22, 2008, poll by John Zogby and The Houston Chronicle stated that Olson had a 17- point lead over Lampson.[7][8][9] On October 30, 2008, Larry Sabato predicted in the Crystal Ball that Olson's congressional race would be a race that would be a ""Republican Pick Up.""[10]
Lampson was considered the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the House because of the heavily Republican tilt of the district. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+15, it was the fourth most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democratic representative. U.S. President George W. Bush carried the 22nd with 64 percent of the vote in 2004.[citation needed]
Because of the unusual circumstances in District 22, the race attracted national attention. In 2007, Stuart Rothenberg called the district ""arguably the best Republican takeover opportunity in the country"".[11] After Olson was nominated, the Electoral-vote.com website identified his campaign as ""probably the GOP's best pickup opportunity for 2008.""[12] The Hill, a leading Washington, D.C. political newspaper, has stated that Olson's victory over Sekula Gibbs has set ""up one of the top House races in the country in a conservative Houston district.""[13] Olson is expected to be well funded.[14]
In 2007, Olson announced he would run for the Republican nomination in the 22nd District. He was one of 10 Republicans in the field. Also running were Sekula-Gibbs, former Pasadena mayor John Manlove, former Sugar Land mayor Dean Hrbacek, State Representative Robert Talton, Senior District Judge Jim Squier, Texas State Board of Education member Cynthia Dunbar, and three minor candidates.
Sekula-Gibbs won the first round with 29.72%. Olson finished second, with 20.72%. As Sekula-Gibbs finished well short of the majority needed to win the nomination outright, Olson and Sekula-Gibbs advanced to a runoff in April.[15][16] Sekula-Gibbs criticized Olson as ""a Washington insider ... [who] moved here just six months ago to run.""[17] Nevertheless, 12 of Texas' 19 Republican congressmen endorsed Olson in the primary.[18]
Olson won the April 8 runoff in a rout with 69 percent of the vote to Sekula-Gibbs' 31 percent.[13][19]
Olson faced Lampson in the general election, and John Wieder, the Libertarian Party candidate. Many election experts considered the race one of the best opportunities for the Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat. Hastings Wyman's Southern Political Report placed the race on its watch list because the roots of the district are solidly Republican, and Lampson won the seat with only 52 percent against a write-in candidate.[20]
On June 20, 2008, the Washington Post's ""The Fix"" commented on the Congressional race: ""it's hard to see Rep. Nick Lampson (D) winning reelection. Lampson's slim hopes got even slimmer"" with the nomination of Olson.[21]
Olson and Lampson agreed to a debate of the issues on October 20, 2008, in Rosenberg, Texas.[22]
At the end of March 2008, Olson's campaign was technically in debt, with almost $128,000 on hand and a debt to the candidate, who provided a personal loan of $175,000.[23]
On June 5, 2008, Vice President Dick Cheney visited Houston to raise money for Olson's Congressional campaign.[24][25] The event took place at the home of Houston billionaire Dan Duncan.
From July 1 to September 30, 2008, Olson raised more money than Lampson, $312,700 to $149,000.[26]
In the November 2008 election, Olson defeated Lampson with 53 percent of the vote to Lampson's 45 percent. He won four of the district's five counties.[27]
Olson won re-election in 2010 with 67 percent of the vote against Democratic challenger Kesha Rogers,[28]who on May 27, 2014 is a Democratic runoff election contestant for the U.S. Senate seat held by Olson's former employer, Republican John Cornyn, who seeks a third term in the November 4 general election.

During the 2008 campaign, Olson claimed he was a better fit for the district than Lampson. Olson told Wall Street Journal reporter Leslie Eaton that ""I have conservative values, and he (Lampson) doesn't."" [2] Indeed, not long after being sworn in, Olson joined the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans.
Olson opposes the current incarnation of Interstate 69, which since 2002 has been part of Governor Rick Perry's controversial Trans-Texas Corridor, a project Gramm did not provide funding for as a U.S. Senator. The previous incarnation of I-69 (which Gramm did fund) was slated to go through the current U.S. Highway 59 which passes through Houston and outlying suburbs such as Sugar Land and Humble.
On July 24, 2013, Olson voted to continue funding NSA surveillance.[29]
In mid-November of 2013, Olson led a group of 19 other Republican congressmen in an effort to impeach Attorney General Eric Holder, charging that Holder had refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2011 and that he had failed to enforce laws defending the Defense of Marriage Act (which had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court)[30] or mandatory minimum sentencing for low-level drug offenders. Olson also charged that Holder had failed to enforce the Controlled Substances Act by not suing Washington and Colorado for deciding to regulate rather than criminalize marijuana. [31]

Though unopposed for his party's nomination for a fourth term in the primary election held on March 4, 2014, Olson must face the Democrat Frank ""Chip"" Briscoe, an architect from Houston, in the November 4 general election. Briscoe polled 3,377 votes (53.2 percent) to defeat his intraparty rival, Mark Gibson, who received 2,967 votes (46.8 percent).[32]Briscoe is a son of the late Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, who was twice defeated in a bid for mayor of Houston and lost the 1966 race in Texas' 7th congressional district to future President George Herbert Walker Bush. He is a cousin of the late Governor Dolph Briscoe.[33][34]
Olson lives in Sugar Land with his wife Nancy and their two children, Kate and Grant, and their dog Riley."

Hurd is the first black Republican elected to Congress from Texas.[3][2]


Hurd is the son of Robert and Mary Alice Hurd of San Antonio. He is a graduate of John Marshall High School in the San Antonio suburb of Leon Valley, Texas.[4] After high school Hurd attended Texas A&M and served as the Student Body President in 1999 at the time of Aggie Bonfire collapse.[1] He graduated from A&M in 2000 with a degree in computer science, a minor in international relations.[1]
Hurd worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for nine years, stationed in Washington, D.C., including a tour of duty as an operations officer in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.[4][1] He speaks Urdu,[5] the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan, where Hurd worked undercover.[5]
One of his roles at the CIA was briefing members of Congress, many of whom could not distinguish the Sunni and Shia divide at the center of Islamic civil wars for centuries.[6] This lack of understanding by members of Congress made Hurd want to pursue politics.[6]
He returned to Texas after his CIA service and worked for Crumpton Group, strategic advisory firm, as a partner and a senior adviser with the cybersecurity firm FusionX.[1] He currently lives in Helotes, a suburb of San Antonio.
Hurd announced his candidacy on November 19, 2009 for the Republican nomination in Texas's 23rd congressional district, a district which is two-thirds Hispanic.[5][7][8] His electronically filed campaign finance records indicated that he had $70,000 on hand to fund his attempt.[9]
On February 15, 2010, Hurd received the endorsement of the San Antonio Express-News.[10] In the primary election on March 2, 2010, he the received the greatest number of votes but failed to received a majority of the votes cast, resulting in a run-off election on April 13, 2010.[11][12] He faced second-place finisher Francisco ""Quico"" Canseco, a San Antonio banker making his third attempt at a Congressional seat.[11] Hurd lost to Canseco in the runoff 53%-47%. Canseco ultimately won the general election but lost in 2012.
Hurd once again ran for the 23rd district in the United States House of Representatives elections, 2014. He defeated former U.S. Representative Quico Canseco, who had lost re-election in 2012, and defeated incumbent Democrat Pete Gallego by 2,500 votes.[1] He was endorsed by the San Antonio Express-News.[1]
He did a post-election swing through some parts of his district that had heavily favored the incumbent Gallego in the voting.[13]
As with the other Congressional freshmen, Hurd's term officially began on January 3, 2015 and was sworn in on January 6. As of 2015[update] Hurd is the only former CIA agent, who has actively served during the War on Terrorism, to be in Congress.[6]
In his first term in Congress, Hurd was made the Chairman of the Information Technology Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (which focuses in part on cybersecurity), which is unusual for a first-term member of Congress.[5][14]
He is vice-chair of the Border and Maritime Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee.[15]
Hurd is pro-life.[16]
He supports stronger border security and opposes granting citizenship to illegal aliens.[1]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes several areas around Dallas and Fort Worth.


Marchant was born February 23, 1951 in Bonham, Texas, but grew up in Carrollton, a Dallas suburb. He graduated from R.L. Turner High School in Carrollton and attended college at Southern Nazarene University (SNU) in Bethany, Oklahoma, graduating with a business degree. He worked as a real estate developer and he owned a homebuilding company prior to entering politics.
Marchant served on the Carrollton City Council from 1980 to 1984, and was mayor of Carrollton from 1984 to 1986.
He was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 2004. During three of his nine terms in the Texas House, Marchant served as chairman of the Committee on Financial Institutions. He pushed for legislation that reorganized the Texas Banking Code. In 2002, he was chosen as Chairman of the Texas House Republican Caucus. In 2004, he was named a Top Ten Legislator by Texas Monthly and Legislator of the Year by the Texas Municipal League.[1]
In the 110th Congress, Marchant served on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, Committee on Education and Labor, and Oversight and Government Reform Committee.[2]
Marchant worked closely with Bush when he was governor of Texas, and bills himself as a staunch conservative. However, he has occasionally broken ranks with the GOP, as he did to increase the minimum wage.[3] He has said that his top priority on Capitol Hill will be cutting the federal deficit with fiscal conservative policies. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[4]
Marchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created 32nd district in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican Pete Sessions, an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the 2003 Texas redistricting, Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts. As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term Democrat Martin Frost, was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white. While Al Gore easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote. Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).
Marchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as two grandchildren.[5] They live in Coppell, a Dallas suburb. Marchant's son Matthew Marchant is the current mayor of Carrollton, Texas."

Previously, he served under Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of State of Texas from November 2004 to July 1, 2007.


Williams was reared in Fort Worth. He was a star baseball player for Texas Christian University (TCU) from 1968 to 1971 and attempted to play professionally with the Atlanta Braves farm team. He returned to Texas to coach TCU's baseball team before he embarked on a career in business and public affairs. Williams joined his father in a family automobile dealership founded in 1939.
He served as Regional Finance Chairman for Governor George W. Bush in his 1994 and 1998 elections. He became North Texas Chairman for the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign, North Texas Finance Chairman in 2004, and National Grassroots Fundraising Chairman for the 2004 campaign. Williams was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2001 to be Chairman of the Republican National Finance Committees Eagles Program.
He has also served as State Finance Chair for John Cornyn's U.S. Senate campaign and as the National Director of the ""Patriots"" program for Cornyn.[2]
Williams was appointed by Governor Perry to the Texas Motor Vehicle Board. He was nominated by Lieutenant Governor Bill Ratliff to the Special Committee on State Employee Compensation and Benefits.
Perry appointed Williams to be his fourth Secretary of State of Texas. As secretary of state, Williams was the Chief Elections Officer for Texas, assisted county election officials and ensured the uniform application and interpretation of election laws through the state. He oversaw the states efforts to comply with the federal Help America Vote Act.[citation needed]
Williams worked to promote economic development, investment, and job creation in Texas.[citation needed] He was also Perry's chief liaison to Mexico and the Border Region of Texas. In this capacity, he worked with Mexican federal, state, and local officials on common issues.[citation needed]
As the overseer and director of Texas elections, Williams's office was in the spotlight during the 2006 Texas governor's race. Independent candidate Richard Friedman (commonly known as ""Kinky"") successfully lobbied to have the name ""Kinky"" placed on the election ballot. Another Independent candidate, Carole K. Strayhorn, sought to have the name ""Grandma"" placed on the ballot next to her name. (Strayhorn's campaign slogan was ""one tough grandma"".) Strayhorn's request was denied. Friedman and Strayhorn finished third and fourth, respectively, in the election, behind Democrat Chris Bell and the winner, incumbent Republican Perry.
Williams announced on June 11, 2007, that he would leave the appointed position to ""pursue other opportunities"".
On July 16, 2007, Williams was named chairman of the Texas Republican Victory 2008 Coordinated Campaign, which assists candidates up and down the general election ballot.[3] Republicans again won all statewide office in 2008 and gained a seat in the United States House of Representatives but lost four seats in the Texas House of Representatives and county offices in populous Harris County.
Late in 2008, Williams formed an exploratory committee to consider a run for the United States Senate seat held by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison of Dallas, who had formed her own committee to consider a 2010 race for governor of Texas. Williams considered a run for Senate in 2012 but decided to run for Congress instead.[4]
In June 2011, Williams announced that he was dropping his Senate bid and would instead run for Texas' 25th congressional district[4][5] Williams ranked first with 25% of the vote, failing to meet the threshold and qualifying for the run-off election. Wes Riddle ranked second with 15% of the vote, qualifying for the run-off election.[6] In the July 31 election, Williams defeated Riddle 58%-42%.[7] In the November general election, Williams defeated Democratic nominee Elaine Henderson 58%-37%.[8]
In the November 4, 2014 general election, Williams will face the Democrat Marco Montoya, who in his primary on March 4 polled 11,294 votes (75 percent) of the ballots cast.[9] Williams is also planning to challenge National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden in his bid for a second term as chairman after the 2014 elections. [10]

Williams and his wife, Patty, live in Weatherford, the seat of Parker County west of Fort Worth, and have two daughters who attended TCU. He owns an automobile dealership in Weatherford. He attends the University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
Williams is a trustee of TCU and the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University in College Station."

In 2002, he defeated Scott Armey, the son of House Majority Leader and then-representative Dick Armey, in a primary runoff election. Prior to his election, he practiced as a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology. Burgess is a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus, and he has been involved in the debates over health care reform and energy policy.


Michael Burgess was born on December 23, 1950 in Rochester, Minnesota, the son of Norma (ne Crowhurst) and Harry Meredith Burgess; his paternal family immigrated from Nova Scotia.[3] He graduated from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) in 1972 and graduated from the medical school at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in 1977. He completed a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.[4]
Burgess, who had never held any public office and voted in the Democratic primaries in 1990, 1992, and 1994, entered in the 2002 Republican primary election to replace U.S. Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey. His primary opponent was Armey's son, Scott. The district, comprising the majority of Denton County, was strongly Republican, and political pundits had predicted that whoever won the primary would not only win the general election, but be assured of at least a decade in Congress.[5] Using the campaign slogan ""My dad is NOT Dick Armey"", Burgess touted the support of medical Political Action Committees and organizations like the National Beer Wholesalers Association.[5][6] Burgess took second place in the primary behind Armey, finishing with 23% of the vote to Armey's 45%. Since neither candidate earned the required majority of votes, the election led to a primary runoff election. Before the runoff, The Dallas Morning News released a series of articles alleging that Armey used his influence as a judge to procure county jobs and contracts for his friends. The report hurt Armey's campaign, and Burgess won the runoff with 55% of the vote. He won the general election with 75% of the vote.[7] He won re-election with 66% in 2004,[8] 60% in 2006,[9] 60% in 2008,[10] 67% in 2010,[11] and 68% in 2012.[12] Burgess did not draw a Democratic challenger for the 2014 general election.
A member of the Republican Party and Tea Party caucus, Burgess is considered to be a conservative member of the House of Representatives. Through 2011, he had a lifetime rating of 93.59percent from the American Conservative Union.[13] Burgess is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge,[14] wherein the signer pledges to:
ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and
TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.[15]
Burgess is one of nine medical doctors in Congress, and one of seven in the House of Representatives. In May 2009, Congressional Quarterly noted that Congressman Burgess had ""become a prominent voice on health care issues"" in the U.S. House.[16] Since the 111th United States Congress, he has chaired the Congressional Health Care caucus, of which he is the only official member.[17]
As a member of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Burgess has been active in the debate over energy policy. In 2011, he submitted an amendment to the 2012 Energy and Water Appropriations Act to defund part of the act that established higher efficiency standards for household light bulbs.[18] However, Burgess' claims that the standards represented a ""ban"" on conventional lightbulbs were rated as ""Mostly False"" by the fact checking website PolitiFact.com.[19]
On August 9, 2011, Burgess met with a Tea Party group in Keller, Texas to discuss his vote to raise the debt ceiling. When a constituent asked if the House of Representatives was considering impeaching President Barack Obama, Burgess responded, ""It needs to happen, and I agree with you it would tie things up... No question about that.""[20]
 While speaking in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act at a House Rules Committee meeting on June 17, 2013, Burgess reasoned that abortions should be illegal after 15 weeks because he had seen fetuses commit intelligent behaviors involving both pleasure and pain, commenting that he had seen male fetuses place their ""hands between their legs"":
You watch a sonogram of a 15 week baby and they have movements that are purposeful. They stroke their face. If they are a male baby, they may have their hand between their legs. I mean, they feel pleasure. Why is it so hard to think they feel pain?
Although he never used the phrase specifically, Burgess' comments were widely regarded as referring to fetal masturbation, and they attracted national attention and controversy. According to other doctors, his statements were ""not based on science"" at the moment, since the evidence is not yet clear as to whether late-term fetuses are aware of pleasure and pain.[21][22][23][24][25]
On February 8, 2013, Burgess introduced the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2013 (H.R. 594; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the muscular dystrophy research program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[26]
On February 6, 2014, Burgess introduced the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress).[27] The bill would replace the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which determines the annual updates to payment rates for physicians services in Medicare, with new systems for establishing those payment rates.[28]
On February 25, 2014, Burgess introduced the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act (H.R. 4080; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize funding for public and private entities that provide trauma and emergency care services and for the administration of the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS).[29][30]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.


Farenthold was born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas, the son of Mary Sue (ne Ogg) and George Randolph ""Randy"" Farenthold. His paternal grandfather, George Edward Farenthold, was a Belgian immigrant who was the descendant of an aristocratic industrialist family and worked in the oil industry in Texas.[3][4] Farenthold attended Incarnate Word Academy and the University of Texas at Austin where he received a bachelor of science degree in Radio, Television, and Film. He also graduated from St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio.[5]
Farenthold's pre-political career includes working as a radio disc jockey in high school and college, seven years of practicing law at the Kleberg Law Firm in Corpus Christi and founding Farenthold Consulting LLC, a computer consulting and web design firm.
Farenthold co-hosted Lago in the Morning, a conservative talk radio program on KKTX radio, until he began his political campaign.
Farenthold's radio career is the model for that of Rev. Spotty Spitford, the antagonist in Jacob Appel's (2012) satiric novel, The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up.[6][7]
Farenthold defeated incumbent Democratic Rep. Solomon Ortiz by 799 votes on election night.[8] Ortiz asked for a manual recount. On Monday, November 22, Ortiz conceded the race to Farenthold. Farenthold's final margin of victory over Ortiz was 47.85 to 47.1 percent held.[9] His margin of victory was 799 votes.[10] Ortiz had represented the district since its creation in 1982.
Redistricting after the 2010 census made Farenthold's district significantly more Republican. His old district had been 70 percent Latino, but the new map shifted most of the Latino areas to the newly created 34th district. To make up for the loss in population, his district was shifted well to the north and east, absorbing some heavily Republican territory near Houston and Austin.
He defeated Democratic nominee Rose Meza Harrison 57%-39%.[11]
Farenthold was not challenged in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Wesley Reed.[12]
Farenthold has joined the Republican Study Committee, as well as the Tea Party Caucus. Since redistricting in 2011, his district runs along the middle Texas gulf coast from Corpus Christi to Bay City and inland to Luling, and includes Aransas, Calhoun, Jackson, Lavaca, Matagorda, Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio, Victoria, Wharton, and parts of Bastrop, Caldwell, and Gonzales counties.
In December 2014, Farenthold was sued by a former staffer, who accused the congressman of gender discrimination, saying that he created a hostile work environment and improperly fired her after she complained.[13]
Farenthold lives with his wife Debbie and two daughters Morgan and Amanda in Corpus Christi. He is the step-grandson of Sissy Farenthold, a long-time Democratic icon in Texas, who was married to his grandfather, George Farenthold, from 1950 until 1985.[citation needed]
In 1972, when Farenthold was ten years old, his father disappeared and was later found dead, his body having washed ashore after being weighed down with a cement block and deposited in Corpus Christi Bay.[14] The gangland-style murder was the work of enemies of the elder Farenthold, who feared he would testify against a group of con artists who had tried to defraud him out of $100,000.[15]
In 2010, images of Farenthold dressed in duck pajamas alongside women in lingerie emerged on the website thecrushgirls.com. Farenthold's Democratic challenger subsequently ran a political ad highlighting the unusual subject nature of the matter.[16]"

Henry Roberto Cuellar (born September 19, 1955) is the U.S Representative for Texas's 28th congressional district, a position he has held since 2005. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district extends from the Rio Grande to the suburbs of San Antonio.
Outside of politics, he has served as a professor at the Texas A&M International University in his native Laredo. The son of migrant workers who never made it past the fifth grade, Cuellar has positioned himself as a strong advocate for education and has often described himself as the most degreed member of Congress, having earned an associates degree, a bachelor's in Foreign Service, a master's degree in International Trade, a law degree, and a Ph.D. in Government. Two schools in Laredo are named in his honor.


Cuellar was born in Laredo, the county seat of Webb County in South Texas, where he has resided most of his life. Cuellar's parents, Martin S., Sr., and Odilia Cuellar, traveled as far north as Idaho each year performing migrant labor but decided to remain in Laredo when Martin found work as a gardener and ranch manager. With eight children, the family lived on Reynolds Street in the Las Lomas neighborhood of ""The Heights"" part of Laredo. None of the streets there were then paved. The parents knew no English but instilled the work ethic in their children.[1]
Henry is the oldest of the Cuellars' children. His brother, Martin, Jr., is the sheriff of Webb County, having been first elected in 2008 over the incumbent fellow Democrat Rick Flores. A sister, Rosie Cuellar-Castillo, is the Laredo municipal judge, having won a nonpartisan runoff election held for that position on December 11, 2010.[2]
Cuellar attended Buenos Aires Elementary School, where he became an avid reader, and graduated in 1973 from J. W. Nixon High School, a classmate of future Webb County District Attorney Joe Rubio, Jr. He received an associate's degree from Laredo Community College (then known as Laredo Junior College), where he would later teach courses in government on a part-time basis. He then attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in foreign service. He also holds a master's degree in International Trade from Texas A&M International University in Laredo and a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas, both in Austin.
Cuellar opened his own law firm in Laredo in 1981 and became a licensed customs broker in 1983. He worked at his alma mater, TAMIU, as an adjunct professor for International Commercial Law from 1984 to 1986.
Prior to being elected to the United States House of Representatives, Cuellar was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 2001, having represented the major portion of Laredo. During his fourteen years as Laredos state representative, he served in leadership positions in the House Appropriations, Higher Education, and Calendar committees. His most notable accomplishments in the Texas State Legislature included coauthoring the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which ensured health-care for thousands of previously uninsured children, and cosponsoring the largest tax cut in Texas history, which included a three-day tax holiday for consumers and small businesses. He also served on several national legislative committees dealing with state budgets, the U.S./Mexico border, and international trade.
In 2001, Cuellar was appointed as Secretary of State of Texas by Republican Governor Rick Perry. Though in office for only eight months, he worked to expand initiatives to register and educate voters and to protect voters rights. He expanded the Border/Mexico Affairs office.
In the 2002 election, Cuellar was the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in Texas's 23rd congressional district. He lost to five-term incumbent Republican Henry Bonilla by 52-47 in the closest race Bonilla had faced up to that date. Bonilla was unseated in 2006 in the revised 23rd District by the liberal Democrat Ciro Rodriguez.
Cuellar spent much of the early part of 2003 preparing for a rematch against Bonilla. The 2003 Texas redistricting, however, shifted most of Laredo, which had been the heart of the 23rd since its creation in 1966, into the 28th district, represented by Ciro Rodriguez. Cuellar challenged Rodriguez, a former friend, for the nomination and won it by fifty-eight votes. [3] The Washington Post described the campaign as ""nasty ... with Cuellar claiming Rodriguez was an AWOL congressman, while Rodriguez called Cuellar a political opportunist. The initial count gave Rodriguez a 145-vote lead, but after a recount Cuellar led by 58 votes. Rodriguez filed a lawsuit questioning the eligibility of hundreds of votes. A state appeals court ruling against Rodriguez guaranteed Cuellar the nomination.[4] Cuellar's victory was one of only two primary upsets of incumbents, from either party, in the entire country.
The 28th district leans far more Democratic than the 23rd, and Cuellar's victory in the general election was a foregone conclusion. In November, he defeated Republican Jim Hopson of Seguin by a 20-point margin, becoming the first Laredoan in over 20 years elected to represent the 28th District of Texas. Cuellar's election to the House in 2004 was a standout for Democrats in a year in which Republicans otherwise gained seats in Texas' delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
On March 7, 2006, Cuellar again defeated Rodriguez in the Democratic primary with 52 percent of the vote in a three-way race. No Republican even attempted to file, ostensibly assuring him of reelection in November.
On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the Texas Legislature had violated the rights of Latino voters when it shifted most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs.[5] As a result, nearly every congressional district from El Paso to San Antonio had to be redrawn, and the primary results for these districts were invalidated. A court drew a new map in which all of Laredo was moved into the 28th district while the south San Antonio area was moved to the 23rd. An election open to all candidates with a runoff if no candidate won 50% was scheduled for the date of the general election, November 7, 2006.
In the general election on November 7, 2006, Cuellar had no Republican opposition but handily defeated Ron Avery of McQueeney, the chairman of the conservative Constitution Party in Guadalupe County and trial attorney and Democrat Frank Enriquez of McAllen by taking nearly 68 percent of the more than 77,000 votes cast in the House race.
Cuellar's two main political rivals, Bonilla and Rodriguez, ran against each other in the 23rd, and Rodriguez won the election in the runoff. The Republican Bonilla was hence out of Congress for the first time since his upset election in 1992.
Cuellar was unopposed in the March 4, 2008 Democratic primary.
In the November 4 general election, Cuellar easily defeated Republican James Taylor Fish (born 1958), a San Antonio-based health-care consultant who resides in Cibolo in Guadalupe County.[6] Jim Fish, as he is known, was a health-care administrator for seventeen years while he served in the United States Air Force. He also taught finance at the Army-Baylor University Graduate School of Health Care Administration. Fish, an ordained Southern Baptist deacon, opposed same-sex marriage. Fish said that he had decided to oppose Cuellar after watching the congressman's exchange with Sheriff Rick Flores over border security issues on a 2007 broadcast of the Glenn Beck television program, then on CNN.[7]
Cuellar received 123,310 votes (68.7 percent) to Fish's 52,394 (29.2 percent) and 3,715 (2.1 percent) for Libertarian Ross Lynn Leone (born September 8, 1946) of Seguin. In his own Webb County, Cuellar polled 41,567 votes (89.5 percent) to Fish's 4,089 votes (8.9 percent).[8]
Cuellar was unopposed for the Democratic nomination in 2010. Motivated by Cuellar's votes on cap and trade and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, two Republicans, Daniel Chavez, a utility company employee from Mission in Hidalgo County, and Bryan Keith Underwood, a carpenter from Seguin in Guadalupe County, filed for their party's nomination to oppose Cuellar in the November 2 general election. Underwood polled 13,599 votes (73.9 percent) to Chavez's 4,794 (26.1 percent).[9]
Underwood raised more funds than Cuellar's previous Republican opponents, but questions were raised in Underwood's hometown newspaper, the Seguin Gazette, about his criminal record, which included a guilty plea for a felony criminal mischief charge, which is normally a misdemeanor. Underwood had also refused on one occasion to present his identification to a law enforcement officer.
Cuellar prevailed, as expected, with 62,055 votes (56.2 percent) to Underwood's 46,417 (42 percent). The remaining 1,880 votes (1.7 percent) were cast for Libertarian Party candidate Stephen Kaat. While Underwood won in Guadalupe, Wilson, McMullen, and Atascosa counties, Cuellar's margin in his own heavily Democratic Webb County (25,415 to 3,569) was more than enough assure him a seat in the incoming Republican-majority House of Representatives.[10]
Cuellar was opposed in the November 6 general election by Republican William R. Hayward, an ostrich rancher from San Marcos in Hays County, and the Libertarian Patrick Hisel, a physician.[11] Hisel ran unsuccessfully as a Libertarian in 2010 against the Republican U.S. Representative Kay Granger from the Tarrant County-based 12th District. Hisel's current city of residence is unknown.
Guadalupe County, a Republican stronghold that usually opposed Cuellar for reelection, was removed from the reconfigured District 28.[12]
Cuellar defeated Hayward, 112,262 (67.9 percent) to 49,095 (29.7 percent). Hisel polled 1.5 percent of the vote, and a Green Party candidate held the remaining .8 of 1 percent of the ballots.[13][14]
Cuellar faces no Republican opposition in 2014. Webb County Republican chairman Randy Blair of Laredo criticized Cuellar's vote for the Obama health law in 2010 but said the GOP could not find an opposing candidate because of Cuellar's personal popularity, political longevity, cooperation with Republicans, and strong campaign organization.[1]
Cuellar is a member of the New Democrat Coalition. He is a Senior Whip, the only Texas Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, and the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security.
Cuellar describes himself as a ""moderate-centrist"" or even as a Conservative Democrat.[1] The Wall Street Journal has called him ""a pro-growth Member [of Congress] in the John F. Kennedy mold,"" while the National Journal has described him as the most centrist member of the Texas congressional delegation.[15] The Issues2000 website classifies Cuellar as a Moderate Liberal Populist.[16]
Cuellar's ratings from various groups include the following: NARAL Pro-Choice America, 50; National Right to Life Center, 20; ACLU, 67; Human Rights Campaign, 70; American Conservative Union, 12; Americans for Democratic Action, 80; Drum Major Institute, A; Family Research Council, 29; Children's Defense Fund, 100; League of Conservation Voters, 100; Numbers USA, D; American Public Health Association, 89; Alliance for Retired Americans, 88; AFL-CIO, 81; National Education Association, A; AFSCME, 86; BIPAC, 60; Chamber of Commerce, 72; Club for Growth, 9; National Federation of Independent Business, 73; Taxes & Spending Americans for Tax Reform, 15; Citizens Against Government Waste, 22; National Taxpayers Union, 7; Defense and Peace Council for a Livable World, 50; Center for Security Policy, 50; Friends Committee on National Legislation, 50; Peace Action, 23; Gunowners of America, C; Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 0.[17]
He supports Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and opposes abortion, though Right-to-Life rates him only 20 percent acceptable and the American Conservative Union, 12 percent. He is one of two Blue Dog Democrat in Texas's Congressional delegation. According to his campaign website, his top priorities are accessibility to constituents, education, healthcare, supporting veterans, serving seniors, providing for small businesses, enhancing homeland security, ensuring border security, advancing trade, and taking any other action that supports hard-working families and individuals.[18]
On August 30, 2010, Cuellar's essay ""Education Investments: A Sure Thing in Shaky Times"" appeared in the Huffington Post, in which he argued that ""Education is the gateway to opportunity. Cuellar lamented that ""only 75 percent of American students graduate from high school, compared to 93 percent in South Korea"" and that ""41 percent of Hispanic adults in the U.S. do not have a high school diploma, compared with 14 percent of white adults."" Many readers posted comments to the effect that the astronomical cost of higher education in a time when there was no guarantee of a job after graduation made its value considerably more suspect than Cuellar suggested.[19]
Although a Democrat, Cuellar has close ties to Rick Perry and George W. Bush and has made bipartisanship a watchword of his political career. In the 2006 primary, he gained the endorsement of the Club for Growth, a conservative group that usually endorses Republicans. His endorsement of Bush for President in 2000 heightened concerns for a time that he might defect to the GOP, but he supported John F. Kerry in 2004. At the joint session of Congress at which Bush delivered his 2006 State of the Union address, a Washington Post photographer snapped a photo of Cuellar standing on the Republican side of the aisle, beaming as President Bush affectionately grabbed his face. Soon after the release of this photo, campaign contributions for his Democratic primary opponent, Ciro Rodriguez, saw an immediate and considerable increase. Cuellar defeated Rodriguez in the primary election and since then has played a more significant role in the Democratic House Caucus.
On February 10, 2010, The Hill ran an article headlined Long shunned, Cuellar now embraced by House Dems by Molly K. Hooper. It began: Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) is finally a member of the club. Shunned by Democratic colleagues years ago, Cuellar has worked to build relationships in the House and is no longer considered an outsider in his own caucus. Hooper noted that while House Democrats had been irked by Cuellar's 2004 primary challenge to Rodriguez and his 2000 endorsement of Bush, ""Times have changed. Cuellar ... has been a team player at crucial times this Congress. Days before the House climate change vote, Cuellar was telling a colleague he was going to vote no when Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tapped him on the shoulder. 'Henry,' Pelosi said, 'can I talk to you about your vote?' President Barack Obama also lobbied Cuellar, who subsequently voted for the bill. Under pressure from the White House, the 54-year-old lawmaker also backed the healthcare bill after securing provisions on medical malpractice.
Nonetheless, noted Hooper, ""Cuellar...still votes against his party. He rejected the first House bailout bill, which was voted down, but backed the final version that passed in the fall of 2008. Cuellar was also one of 27 Democrats who opposed the House financial regulatory reform bill, a top priority for Obama. Cuellar consistently works with members on both sides of the aisle, a rarity for House members. In fact, he says his best friend in the lower chamber is a Republican: Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas).[20]
Cuellar has sometimes been criticised by fellow Democrats for being too close to Republicans. It has occasionally been suggested during his career that he would switch to the Republican Party. In an interview in September 2014, Cuellar said: ""I'm a Democrat, and I will die as a Democrat ... if a person, an elected official, puts party before their country or their state, it's wrong. We're certainly seeing that in Washington, where party comes first, and if youre not loyal to the party, theres something wrong with you. The easy for thing for me is to always go along with the Democratic Party, but that would not serve my state and that would not serve the district itself... I'm the first Democrat that pays my dues [to the DCCC]... I pay more than anybody, any other Democrat, congressional member, in the state of Texas. I've done that for the last couple of years. I dont go around and say, I give more money than anybody, but I support my party. If you are going to have a litmus test  out of 100 votes, you support your party and that makes you a good member of Congress? I think thats the wrong litmus test. Whats good for America and whats good for Texas, that should be the litmus test.""[21]
On June 26, 2009, Cuellar voted with the House majority to pass, 219-212, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, also known as the cap and trade bill[22] He also supported the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which narrowly passed the House and in December 2009 met the threshold for shutting off debate in the U.S. Senate by a single vote. As a pro-life Democrat, Cuellar expressed concerns that the Senate health care bill allowed federal funding for abortion. Cuellar voted on March 21, 2010, for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed the chamber by a vote of 219-212.[23]
On June 15, 2007, Cuellar announced that he was endorsing then U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for President in 2008, saying that ""Senator Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House."" In 2007, Cuellar held a fundraiser for Clinton in Laredo, which raised over $200,000  aided by the presence of former President Bill Clinton. Laredo's Democratic Mayor Raul G. Salinas joined Cuellar in giving his early support to Hillary Clinton, who came to Laredo in October 2008 to endorse Cuellar's reelection to the U.S. House. On November 4, 2008, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Webb County with 71% of the vote to McCain's 28%.
Congressman Cuellar is the author and one of two main co-sponsors of legislation seeking to honor slain ICE agent Jaime Zapata. Billed as a border security bill, it would increase cooperation among state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies during investigations of human and drug smuggling from Mexico.
On July 24, 2013, Cuellar voted to continue funding NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens who are not suspected of committing any crime, in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights according to some views of the Bill of Rights.
In 2013, in a statement with House colleagues Beto O'Rourke of El Paso and Filemon Vela of Brownsville, Cuellar renewed his opposition to a border fence along the Rio Grande between the United States and Mexico. He denounced inclusion in the Senate immigration bill of an amendment sponsored by Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota, which calls for seven hundred additional miles of border fencing. Cuellar called the fence an antiquated solution to a new-age problem. The fence, he said, ignores the economic ties between the two nations which reached $500 billion in 2012.[24]
In 2014, Cuellar was the only House Democrat to vote for a House bill that would have made it easier to deport unaccompanied minors to Central America. He also released unauthorized photographs of unsanitary conditions in Border Patrol detention centers. Despite these actions, Cuellar said he is firmly in support of ""comprehensive immigration reform"".[1]
Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, have two daughters, Christina Alexandra and Catherine Ann. The city of Laredo has recognized him by naming two schools in his honor: the Doctor Henry Cuellar Elementary School and the Representative Henry Cuellar Charter School.
In 2014, Cuellar portrayed George Washington in the annual Washington's Birthday Celebration in Laredo.[26]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes most of eastern Houston, along with large portions of Houston's eastern suburbs.


Green was born in Houston and he graduated from the University of Houston, earning a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1971 and a law degree in 1977. He held positions as a business manager and a private attorney prior to his election to Congress.
Green was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1972. He was elected to the Texas Senate in 1985.
Green was first elected to the U.S. House in 1992. Although the 29th was (then as now) drawn as a majority-Hispanic district, Green finished second in the five-way Democratic primary, behind city councilman Ben Reyes. Green defeated Reyes in the runoff by only 180 votes, all but assuring him of election in this heavily Democratic district. Green has been reelected eight times, never facing substantive electoral opposition. He ran unopposed in 1998, 2002 and 2004.
Green is the only caucasian Democrat representing a significant portion of Houston, and one of only three in the entire Texas delegation (the others being Lloyd Doggett and Beto O'Rourke).
Since 1996, Green has been a member of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. In 2011, he became Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy. He also serves on the Subcommittee on Energy and Power and the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

Congressman Green voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution in 2002, and gave a speech on the house floor linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks in 2001. Despite the Democratic leadership's general disapproval of the war, Green voted against measures aimed at placing a timetable on military withdrawal.
In September 2004, he proposed the Every Vote Counts Amendment, which would have abolished the U.S. electoral college in United States presidential elections.
Congressman Green has also proposed legislation addressing domestic and global electronic waste (e-waste) concerns. H.R. 2284, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act of 2011, was introduced in the 112th Congress to prohibit the exportation of some electronics whose improper disposal may create environmental, health, or national security risks.
Green also served on the Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health during drafting of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and helped write and amend the legislation. Since then, he has worked for increased access to affordable and quality health care."

An African-American, she is the first registered nurse elected to the U.S. Congress.


Born and reared in Waco, Texas, Johnson's first aspirations were in medicine. She could not attend college in her own state because of her race, so she left Texas and attended Saint Mary's College in South Bend, Indiana, where she received a diploma in nursing in 1956. She transferred to Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, from which she received a bachelor's degree in nursing. She later attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and earned an MPA in 1976.[1] She served as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital (the first African American to hold that position), and entered politics after 16 years in that position.[2]
In 1972, as an underdog candidate running for a seat in the Texas House, Eddie Bernice Johnson won a landslide victory and became the first black woman ever elected to public office from Dallas.[3] She soon became the first woman in Texas history to lead a major Texas House committee, the Labor Committee. Johnson left the state House in 1977, when President Jimmy Carter appointed her as the regional director for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the first African American woman to hold this position.[4]
Johnson entered politics again in 1986, and was elected a Texas state Senator, becoming the first female and African-American from the Dallas area to hold this office since Reconstruction. Her particular concerns as a Senator included health care, education, public housing, racial equity, economic development, and job expansion. She served on the Finance Committee, for which she chaired the subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and on the Education Committee. Her interest in health care led her to write legislation to regulate diagnostic radiology centers, require drug testing in hospitals, prohibit discrimination against AIDS victims, improve access to health care for AIDS patients, and prohibit hospital kickbacks to doctors. As a fair housing advocate, she sponsored a bill to empower city governments to repair substandard housing at the expense of landlords, and wrote a bill to enforce prohibitions against housing discrimination.[5]
As a lawmaker, Johnson was able to bring to a public forum her fight against racism, though she faced discrimination herself in the legislature. ""Being a woman and being black is perhaps a double handicap,"" she told the Chicago Tribune. ""When you see who's in the important huddles, who's making the important decisions, it's men.""[6] Johnson sponsored several bills aimed towards equity, including a bill to establish goals for the state to do business with 'socially-disadvantaged' businesses, and crafted a fair housing act aimed at toughening up fair housing laws and establishing a commission to investigate complaints of discriminatory housing practices.
In addition to her legislation, Johnson held hearings and investigated complaints. In 1989, she testified in a federal court about racism in the Dallas city government. In 1992, she formally asked the Justice Department to investigate harassment of local black students. That same year, she held hearings to examine discrimination charges about unfair contracting bids for the government's Superconducting Super Collider. One thing Johnson fears most about discrimination is the legacy it leaves for youth. ""I am frightened to see young people who believe that a racist power structure is responsible for every negative thing that happens to them,"" she explained to the New York Times. ""After a point it does not matter whether these perceptions are true or false; it is the perceptions that matter.""[7]
Midway through her second term in the state senate, Johnson opted to run in the Democratic primary for the newly-created 30th congressional district. She defeated Republican nominee Lucy Cain 72%-25%.[8] In 1994, she defeated Lucy Cain again 73%-26%.[9] In 1996, after her district was significantly redrawn as a result of Bush v. Vera, she won re-election to a third term with just 55% of the vote, the worst election performance of her congressional career. However, this election was held under unusual circumstances. All of the candidates in the race appeared on a single ballot regardless of party, and Johnson faced two other Democrats. Proving just how Democratic this district still was, the three Democrats tallied 73 percent of the vote between them. [10] Johnson has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected 18 more times with at least 72% of the vote. In the most recent cycle Johnson easily beat two opponents in the Democratic Primary, State Representative Barbara Mallory Caraway and lawyer Taj Clayton, gaining 70% of the vote; she went on to win the general election by a landslide, gaining almost 79% of the votes cast.[11]
The 17th chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, she was a leading voice in opposition to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. During debate on the House floor, she stated:
""I am not convinced that giving the President the authority to launch a unilateral, first-strike attack on Iraq is the appropriate course of action at this time. While I believe that under international law and under the authority of our Constitution, the United States must maintain the option to act in its own self-defense, I strongly believe that the administration has not provided evidence of an imminent threat of attack on the United States that would justify a unilateral strike. I also believe that actions alone, without exhausting peaceful options, could seriously harm global support for our war on terrorism and distract our own resources from this cause.""[12]
She was one of the 31 who voted in the House against counting the electoral votes from Ohio in the United States presidential election, 2004.[13]
In 2007, Congresswoman Johnson was appointed by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar (D-MN) to serve as Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment during the 110th and 111th Congresses. She was the first African-American and first female in Congress to hold the position of this Subcommittee Chair. While holding the position of Subcommittee Chair, Congresswoman Johnson sponsored the Water Resources Development Act. She successfully secured and led Congress in overriding President Bushs veto of it. This was the only veto override during his presidency.[14]
During the 2007 primary campaign, Johnson initially supported U.S. Senator John Edwards for President. After his withdrawal from the race, she pledged her support as a superdelegate to Barack Obama and her district backed Obama heavily in the 2008 election.
Recently, the Congresswoman, along with Rep. Donna Edward (D) proposed a publicly funded park on the moon to mark where the Apollo missions landed between 1969 and 1972.The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, H.R. 2617, calls for the park to be run jointly by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[15]
In August 2010, Amy Goldson, counsel for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, said that Johnson violated organizational rules by awarding scholarship money to four relatives and two children of a top aide. Awards come with an anti-nepotism rule, and winners must live or study in the Congress member's district. Johnson said she ""unknowingly"" made a mistake in awarding the grants and would work with the foundation to rectify it.[16]
Johnson said, ""I recognized the names when I saw them. And I knew that they had a need just like any other kid that would apply for one.""
Soon after Johnson denied having involvement in the scholarship process, opponent Stephen Broden released letters bearing Johnson's signature in which the representative requested that the scholarship check be made and sent directly to her relatives instead of to the University as would normally be procedure.[17] Subsequently, the Dallas Morning News ran an editorial questioning her changing story on the matter.[18]
In December 2010, Congresswoman Johnson was elected as the first African-American and the first female Ranking Member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.[19] From 2000 to 2002, she was the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education. Congresswoman Johnson been an outspoken advocate for the need to invest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. In April, 2012 Johnson introduced the ""Broadening Participation in STEM Education Act. The Broadening Participation in STEM Education Act would authorize the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award grants to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups receiving degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The bill would also expand the number of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups at colleges and universities.[20]
Congresswoman Johnson is a current member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and has been since being elected in 1992. She is also the highest ranking Texan on this committee. Congresswoman Johnson also presently serves on the Aviation Subcommittee, Highways and Transit Subcommittee and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.
Johnson was handily re-nominated in the Democratic primary election held on March 4, 2014. She polled 23,688 votes (69.9 percent) to former state Representative Barbara Mallory Caraway's 10,185 (30.1 percent). Caraway has also run against Johnson previously.[21]"

He is a member of the Republican Party. Carter was elected Secretary of the House Republican Conference by his colleagues on November 17, 2006.


Carter was born in Houston, but has spent most of his life in central Texas. Carter graduated from Texas Tech University with a degree in history in 1964, and earned a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law in 1969.
After graduating from law school, Carter served as the first general counsel to the Texas House of Representatives Agriculture Committee. Carter later began a successful private law practice in Round Rock.
In 1981, Carter was appointed as judge of the 277th District Court of Williamson County. He was elected to the post a year later  the first Republican elected to a countywide position in Williamson County. He was reelected four times, usually with 60% of the vote.
A staunch fiscal and social conservative, Carter prides himself on having raised a family built on what he calls ""Texas Values.""
Carter is best known as the author of a law that made it easier to prove identity theft and provides stiff penalties for the offense. It was signed into law by George W. Bush in 2004.
In the 110th Congress, Congressman Carter has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills including the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, the Terrorist Death Penalty Act of 2008, and a bill condemning the vandalism of the Vietnam War Memorial on the National Mall. On the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Carter introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million in funding to the section 287(g) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA) which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement allowing them to investigate, detain and arrest criminal aliens. However, this amendment was defeated in committee.
Also, when Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives recessed in August 2008 for five weeks, Congressman Carter was one of many Republicans who stayed in Washington. This was part of a GOP protest, in which they claimed that Congress should not have recessed for five weeks without addressing the energy crisis many Americans were facing. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that as of 2008 among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Carter had the second-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[1]
On June 12, 2009, Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen.[2]
On September 15, 2009, Carter called the 111th Congress a ""house of hypocrisy"" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson for his outburst, but would not go after New York Representative and House Ways and Means Chair Charlie Rangel, who has been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property.[3] Carter is also a proponent of the ""Rangel Rule,"" where IRS penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and former South Dakota Senator (and one-time Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) Tom Daschle received after their tax problems were made public.[4]
Carter introduced a ""Privileged Resolution"" that would have forced the resignation of Rangel from his position as House Ways and Means Committee Chair after he declined to resign voluntarily [5] citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons. The resolution failed but it was noted that two Mississippi Democrats, Gene Taylor and Travis Childers, broke party ranks and voted with Republicans.[6][7]
Although a critic of the accuracy of Rangel's financial disclosures, Carter voluntarily amended his financial disclosure forms in mid-October 2009 to list nearly $300,000 in capital gains from the sale of Exxon stock in 2006 and 2007. Though Carter listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.[8]
On November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.[9]
In February 2010, after Charlie Rangel was found to have broken House rules, Carter again demanded that Rangel step down. Rangel later stepped down, avoiding a third attempt at a privileged resolution to remove Rangel. Ever after stepping down, Carter continued to demand that Democrats comply by their promises of running the ""most ethical Congress in history"" and to ""drain the swamp"" that were made in 2006 after Democrats took over the House.
Carter retired from the bench in 2001 in order to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff  which was tantamount to election in this heavily Republican district. He has been reelected twice without facing serious opposition.
Carter originally represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to the fringes of the Houston suburbs, and also included College Station, home of Texas A&M University. As a result of the 2003 Texas redistricting, however, Carter now represents a district stretching from the fringes of the Metroplex through more rural portions of Central Texas. The 31st District now includes Fort Hood, home of the U.S. Army's 3d Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Division.
He has been married to Erika Carter for almost 40 years, and they have four grown children. Since 1971, he has lived in Round Rock, just north of Austin."

He represents Texas's 32nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is the current chairman of the House Rules Committee and a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.[1]


Sessions was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Alice June (ne Lewis) and William Steele Sessions, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[2] He grew up in Waco and in the suburbs of Washington, DC. He graduated from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas in 1978. He worked for Southwestern Bell for 16 years and rose to the rank of district manager for marketing in Dallas, supervising 435 employees and managing a $16 million budget. He also worked at Bell Communications Research, formerly called Bellcore and currently named Telcordia Technologies, in New Jersey.[citation needed]
In his 1991 election bid, Sessions finished third in a special election for the House of Representatives.
In 1993, he left his job with Southwestern Bell to again run for Congress, against 5th District incumbent Democratic Congressman John Bryant. He toured the district with a livestock trailer full of horse manure, claiming that the Clinton Administration's health care plan stank more than the manure. He lost by 2,400 votes. He subsequently became vice president for public policy at the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), a Dallas-based conservative public policy research institute.
In 1996, when Bryant decided to seek a Senate seat, Sessions was elected to succeed him in the 5th District, defeating Democratic candidate John Pouland with 47 percent of the vote.
He was re-elected in 1998, defeating schoolteacher Victor Morales with 56 percent of the vote.
In 2000, he ran against Regina Montoya Coggins, and was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote.
When redistricting after the 2000 Census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District for the 2002 election, in which he ran against Pauline Dixon and won the district with 68 percent of the vote.
In 2004, Sessions defeated 13-term, Democratic incumbent Congressman Martin Frost, who had moved to the 32nd after the redistricting in 2003 eliminated Frost's former district. He won 54-44%, in what was considered the most expensive U.S. House race in the nation. According to the Associated Press, ""The race also was one of the nastiest, with Frost unearthing a decades-old streaking incident by Sessions in his college days and questioning his commitment to security with an ad featuring the World Trade Center towers in flames. In response, he criticized Frost for booking Peter Yarrow of the 1960s group Peter, Paul and Mary for a fundraiser. Yarrow had faced an indecency with a child charge years earlier.""
In 2010, he faced Dallas businessman and attorney Grier Raggio and Libertarian John Jay Myers. The election was initially considered one of the top dark horse battles in the country, but Sessions won re-election.[3]
In 2012, he faced the Democratic candidate, Katherine Savers McGovern, and independent, Seth Hollis. He was endorsed by the Dallas Morning News and won re-election.
In the 2014 Republican primary, Sessions defeated conservative Katrina Pierson, an African American and a favorite of the Tea Party movement. He polled 28,954 votes (63.6 percent) to her 16,560 (36.4 percent).[4]
Sessions supported the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014 (H.R. 4032; 113th Congress), a bill that would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) from prosecution under the Lacey Act for transferring water containing invasive species from Oklahoma to Texas.[5] The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders.[5] Sessions argued that the bill was necessary to prevent ""more than 1.5 million customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District"" from facing ""restricted access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in Lake Texoma.""[6]
Earlier in his career, he passed the Family Opportunity Act.[citation needed] In 2008, he joined his colleagues Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Patrick Kennedy, and Eleanor Holmes Norton in forming the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus to educate members of Congress and their staff, about Down Syndrome.[citation needed]
In 2011, he sponsored of the ABLE Act, which sought to amend Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986. It did not pass in the 112th Congress and was reintroduced in the 113th Congress.[7]
He was involved in the effort to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America by introducing a ""100 Years of Scouting"" commemorative coin, released in 2010.[dated info][8] In 2008, Pres. George W. Bush signed H.R. 5872 entitled, the ""Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act."" [9] The BSA recognized him as a ""Distinguished Eagle Scout."" He holds a position on the Circle Ten Council of the BSA. Both of his sons are also active in scouting.[10]
In the 2010 election, during his tenure as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party gained control of the House with significant gains. They won a net gain of 63 seats and 89 new freshman members.[11]
In 2012, he was named chairman of the House Rules Committee for the 113th Congress by Speaker of the House John Boehner. The Rules Committee is among the oldest standing committees in the House, having been first formally constituted on April 2, 1789.[citation needed]
In late 2001 and early 2002, he cosigned letters to two Cabinet members asking them to shut down casinos operated by several Native American tribes. Within 18 months of sending the letters, he received a total of $20,500 from tribes associated with Jack Abramoff, raising suspicion [according to whom?] that he had written the letters to curry favor with Abramoff as he represented a number of competing tribes. In response, his office said that he wrote the letters because of his view that gambling is a local issue, falling under his long held support for federalism.[12]
In early February 2009, Sessions made the following comment about the Republican Party legislative strategy in the House of Representatives: ""Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban,"" he said, during the 60-minute sitdown.[13] ""And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person's entire processes.""[14] He continued: ""I'm not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban.... I'm saying an example of how you go about [it] is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their frontline message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with.""[15]
In 2008, he added a $1.6 million earmark to an appropriations bill, for dirigible research. The earmark benefitted a Chicago company, Jim G. Ferguson & Associates, which had no experience in government contracting or dirigible research. Former Sessions aide and convicted felon Adrian Plesha was a lobbyist for the firm.[16][17]
In September, Adrian Plesha sued Jim G. Ferguson & Associates for non-payment of fees and expenses connected with his lobbying effort on their behalf.[18]
Sessions came under criticism for his personal ties to Allen Stanford. Records showed that he received over $44,000 in political contributions from Allen Stanford and his associates.[19] He also took multiple trips to Fire Island and to the Caribbean to attend Stanford sponsored events.[19] These trips included private travel on Stanford's fleet of jets and accommodations.[19]
In September 2010, Sessions remarked after watching the Princeton University men's basketball team, ""How often can you go see a bunch of white guys play basketball?"" He also reportedly said that the players stayed entirely below the rim. The comments were described as an allusion to the phrase ""White Men Can't Jump"", and were labeled as inappropriate by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell.[20]
Less than two weeks after his ""white guys"" comments he made controversial comments about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) giving money to and supporting, ""African Americans like Sanford Bishop. And when you have to retreat back to ... your hard base you're having to make tough decisions.""[21][22]
In January 2012, it was reported that Sessions received a so-called ""VIP"" or ""Friends of Angelo"" loan in 2007 from troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo created the program to boost the company's standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. He received a $1 million loan from Countrywide at below-market rates, which he never declared in financial disclosures. His, as well as names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts.[23][24] He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform when their investigation revealed he did not receive any preferential treatment or a below market interest rate on his mortgage from Countrywide.[25]
During the 2013 government shutdown, after being questioned by another individual regarding his position on the shutdown and his presence at the National World War II Memorial, which was open while other National Park Service monuments and parks remained closed, he replied that ""we're not the French; we don't surrender.""[26]
In August 2011, he and Juanita divorced, after 27 years of marriage. They have two sons, Bill and Alex.[27] In August 2012, he married Karen Diebel.[28]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party.


Vela was born in Harlingen, Texas and raised in Brownsville, Texas. His father, Filemon Bartolome Vela, Sr., was a long-serving United States federal judge. The Reynaldo G. Garza-Filemon B. Vela United States Courthouse in Brownsville is named in Judge Vela's honor. His mother, Blanca Sanchez Vela, served as Brownsvilles first female mayor from 1999 to 2003.[2][3][4]
Filemon attended Saint Joseph Academy in Brownsville, Texas, and went on to graduate from Georgetown University in 1985. During his time at Georgetown, he served as an intern at the Federal Judicial Center  the research and education agency of the federal judicial system. He also served as an intern in Congressman Solomon P Ortizs Washington, D.C. office. Vela earned his J.D. from University of Texas at Austin School of Law in 1987.[2]
For more than 20 years, Filemon practiced law in South Texas, helping countless individuals seek justice in state and federal courts across the country. His legal practice focused on complex civil litigation. As a trial attorney, Filemon successfully represented clients who were the victims of racial discrimination, consumers who had been severely injured by defective products, and employees injured during work.
Some notable cases include Earl Shinhoster v. Ford Motor Company where Vela represented the family of deceased Director of the NAACP who was killed in a car rollover accident in what was the largest wrongful death settlements in Alabama history and Robert Trevino v. Walmart where Vela represented a group of American farm workers who were told they could not shop in a Mississippi store because of discrimination against Hispanics.[4]
As an attorney, Vela also represented several South Texas school districts. In Edinburg School District v. Landmark, Vela represented Edinburg to fight for more funding and in Pharr-San Juan-Alamo Independent School District v. Landmark, he represented the district in fighting contractors accused of building another poorly constructed school facility.
[5]
Vela decided to run in the newly created Texas's 34th congressional district as a Democrat. In the May 29 primary, Vela ranked first in an 8-candidate field with 40% of the vote.[6] In the July 31 run-off primary, Vela defeated Denise Saenz Blanchard 67%-33%.[7][8]
In the general election, Vela defeated Republican Jessica Bradshaw 62% - 36%, winning the election.[9]
In July 2013, he decided to quit the Congressional Hispanic Caucus because of his opposition to the Hoeven-Corker Amendment that tied border security with a pathway to citizenship. He said erecting more border fence drives a wedge between border communities which are culturally united.[10][11]
Vela's wife, Rose, was a Republican justice on Texas 13th Court of Appeals from 2007 to 2012.[12]"

A member of the Democratic Party, he has represented a district based in the state capital, Austin, since 1995, currently numbered as the 35th district.


Born in Austin, Doggett received both a Bachelor's degree in business and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the University of Texas at Austin, he also joined Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.
His electoral career began in 1973, when he was elected to the Texas State Senate, serving until 1985. He authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing ""cop killer"" bullets and a ""sunset law"" requiring periodic review of government agencies. He first gained notoriety in 1979, as a member of the ""Killer Bees""  a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former governor John Connally a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a closed primary. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a quorum. The bill was withdrawn five days later.
In 1989 he became both a justice on the Texas Supreme Court and an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law, his alma mater, serving until his election to Congress.
Described as an endangered species, Doggett was one of only three white Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the other being Gene Green and Beto O'Rourke) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.[1] He is one of the most liberal white Democrats from a Southern district, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent Texas in Congress. He has been described as a strong voice for his party on taxes and environmental policies and as a ""muscular progressive"".[2]
Doggett has been highly partisan at times. He was a frequent critic of Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker, while allying with David Bonior, the [Democratic] Minority Whip, when Bonior was leading an effort to diminish Gingrich's power by raising continual questions about his ethics.[3] He has been a close ally of Nancy Pelosi. In 2002, Doggett supported Pelosi's successful bid to become the party's House leader over fellow Texan Martin Frost, a more moderate candidate.[4]
Doggett has long supported more open government, and is also a leading advocate for campaign finance reform. On the Ways and Means Committee, he has sought to close many overseas tax shelters. Doggett has authored legislation to create tax incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and to create a nationwide Silver Alert system.
Doggett is pro-choice. In 2003 he voted against a bill that would have banned all partial-birth abortions. He was given a 100% by the NARAL.[5] He voted in favor of a bill to provide federal funding for embryonic stem cell research in 2007.
Doggett is a strong supporter of environmental preservation. He is one of the leading opponents in the House of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska. The League of Conservation Voters gives Doggett a 100%,[6] indicating that Doggett supports the League of Conservation Voter's interpretation of environmental preservation.
In June 2009, Doggett voted in favor of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a bill that would have established an emissions trading system for American producers of carbon dioxide. Doggett remarked It has been a difficult and significant decision. I just decided that I will have a better chance to make changes later in the process if I acted in good faith now. But don't think this means I'm signing off on the conference report, Doggett added.[7]
Doggett voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in the 109th Congress. He voted against HR 4380 and HR 2587, bills that would have banned adoption by same-sex couples.[8] In 1996, Doggett voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), but became a cosponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal DOMA, in 2011.[9][10]
Doggett introduced legislation focused on restricting American companies from using overseas strategies to reduce their corporate tax rates. He voted against the 2010 tax compromise, criticizing the renewal of the Bush tax cuts, saying This bill is largely a mish-mash of rejected Republican ideas that cost too much to accomplish too little.[11] He led a group of Democrats who criticized the inclusion of a Social Security payroll tax reduction, saying it would endanger the soundness of the program.[4]
In 2010, Doggett was responsible for an amendment to an education jobs bill which would mandate Texas keeping the same amount of education funding for three years in order to receive $832 million in federal money. Rick Perry called it an unconstitutional anti-Texas amendment and would later file a lawsuit after the Department of Education declined the application for funds.[12][13]
Doggett has backed bills with the intention of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting cap-and-trade as well as clean technologies. Doggett supported the 2009 climate-change bill, despite claiming it didn't do enough to protect the environment. He said it stripped the EPA of too much power and was too beneficial to coal plants and other polluters. Doggett supports auctioning carbon allowances, and has worked to make legislation usually associated with the House Ways and Means Committee to be associated with the Energy and Commerce Committee.[12][14]
In March 2010, Doggett voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Prior to his vote, Doggett cited concerns with the bill not including enough affordability, insurance competition provisions, and consumer protection provisions. Originally an advocate of a public option, he conceded the option in the final vote.[4]
In August 2009 a rally against the health care plans broke out after Doggett said that he would support the bill even if his constituents were opposed to the legislation. The protestors, who chanted just say no, were later criticized by Doggett, who called them a mob and extremists, and said the group was part of the party of no.[15] Of the situation, he said: Their fanatical insistence on repealing Social Security and Medicare is not just about halting health care reform but rolling back 75 years of progress. Doggett stated that he was committed to individual choices.
Doggett reportedly tried to answer questions, but felt the demonstrators opposed all government programs, including Social Security and Medicare, in addition to the health care plan. He said that [i]n Texas, not only with the weather but with the politics, it is pretty hardball around here ... I have a pretty thick skin about all of this. But this really goes over the line.'[16]
Doggett supports a guest worker program for illegal immigrants. In 2004, he voted against a bill that would have required hospitals to report illegal immigrants who received hospital treatment to the U.S. Department of Justice. FAIR gave him a score of 0% in 2003.[17]
Doggett was one of the leading opponents of the authorization of the Iraq War in 2003 and called for a timetable for U.S. troops pulling out of Iraq. On May 24, 2007, Doggett was one of 140 Democrats and 2 Republicans to vote against HR 2206, a bill that would provide emergency supplemental appropriations for funding the war, and in 2009 he was one of only 30 Representatives to vote against HR 2346 which provided funding to continue war.[18]
In 1984 he lost the U.S. Senate election to Phil Gramm by a margin of 59%-41%. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 in what was then the 10th District after 32-year incumbent Jake Pickle retired. He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year's massive Republican landslide. Running for re-election in 1996, Congressman Doggett defeated a challenger in Republican Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first re-election, Doggett would consistently win around 85% of the vote, facing only Libertarian opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by Lyndon Johnson, had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.
Redistricting by the Texas Legislature in 2003 split Austin, which had been located entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, among three districts. Through Republican gerrymandering, Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the Houston suburbs. Most of Doggett's former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to McAllen on the Mexican border. It was called ""the fajita strip"" or ""the bacon strip"" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primarythe real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and went on to victory in November.[citation needed]
On June 28, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the nearby 23rd District's lines violated the rights of Latino voters. As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino Laredo had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino districtin other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place. While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.[19]
Due to the size of the 23rd, the ruling forced the redrawing of five districts between El Paso and San Antonio, including the 25th. For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the University of Texas at Austin, which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city. After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010his closest race since 1996.
It was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett's district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one.[20] The new map split Doggett's old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th District stretching from western Austin all the way to the fringes of the Metroplex. Much of his old base, however, was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin.[21] Doggett's home was located approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had gerrymandered the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.[22]
Doggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, ""The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities  that is what this is about, as well."" He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by ""deny(ing) the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city."" He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.[23]
Doggett was set to face State Representative Joaquin Castro in the District 35 primary election. The potential race was described as the biggest threat to Dogett's survival yet, with Castro being seen as a rising star in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later clarified, saying that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided.[24] However, Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th District after its incumbent, Charlie Gonzalez, announced his retirement.
Doggett eventually decided to run in the 35th District, facing Bexar County assessor Sylvia Romo. Before the primaries, he said that he would move into the district if he were to win. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett has stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wants to stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care, and also notes his strong support for both higher education programs and public education. By contrast, Romos campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.[22]
Doggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote.[25] He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented. The district is so heavily Democratic that he was heavily favored to win the general election in November.[26] He easily defeated Republican challenger Susan Narvaiz in the general election to become the first Anglo Democrat to represent a significant portion of San Antonio since Chick Kazen left office in 1985.
The Sunlight Project estimates his average net worth in 2006 was over $13 million.[28] In 2008, the Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Doggett has the 11th-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.[29]
In April 2008 while celebrating the upcoming Earth Day Doggett fell off of his bicycle and broke his leg. This accident was similar to a bicycle crash that occurred a year previously in which his friend, the former mayor of Austin Bruce Todd, fell off his bicycle and suffered a serious head injury and several broken bones.[30] [31]"

University of Texas Dental School","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Babin","Brian Babin","Republican","Lower Neches Valley Authority, Texas Historical Commission, Mayor of Woodville","Baptist - SBC","Brian Babin (born March 23, 1948) is an American dentist, politician and member of the Republican Party who has served as the U.S. Representative from Texas's 36th congressional district since January 2015.
Babin, a graduate of Lamar University and the University of Texas Dental School, served in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1979. He then opened a dental practice in Woodville and became involved in Republican politics.
He worked for various state and federal campaigns and held numerous local and regional government positions, including President of the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (19811987), on the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (19821984), Mayor of Woodville (19821984), on the Woodville City Council (19841989), on the Texas Historical Commission (19891995), Chairman of the Tyler County Republican Party (19901995), on the Woodville Independent School District Board (19921995) and on the Lower Neches Valley Authority (19992015).
Babin was the Republican nominee for Texas's 2nd congressional district in 1996 and 1998, losing to Democrat Jim Turner on both occasions. He ran again in 2014 to succeed Steve Stockman, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate, and was elected to succeed him.


Babin graduated from Lamar University in 1973 and later went on to serve as an officer in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1979, retiring at the rank of Captain. While serving, he earned a B.S. in biology from Lamar University in 1975 and then enrolled in the University of Texas Dental School and graduated with his D.D.S. in 1976.[1] To pay for his tuition, he worked as a janitor, merchant seaman and postman and sang folk and country music in local restaurants with his wife Roxanne, whom he met in college.[1][2]
Babin and his wife Roxanne have been married since 1972 and they have five children: daughter Marit, an attorney and former press staffer at the National Republican Congressional Committee; son Leif, a former Navy SEAL; twins Kirsten, an educator, and Lucas, a model and actor; and daughter Laura Larua.[1][2] He is also the father-in-law of journalist and Fox News Channel anchor Jenna Lee, who is married to his son Leif.[3]
Babin has been engaged in general dental practice in Woodville since 1979.[1] He first entered politics in 1980, saying that when stationed overseas he felt ""demoralized"" by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. He thus worked for the Ronald Reagan campaign for President, first as county co-ordinator and then regional co-ordinator. Deep East Texas was then heavily Democratic, and Babin is considered to be ""instrumental"" in turning the region Republican over the years.[1][4][5][6] He also worked at the county, state and regional level for Reagan's re-election campaign, the George H. W. Bush campaign for President and the Bill Clements and George W. Bush campaigns for Governor of Texas.
Additionally, he has variously served as the Mayor of Woodville (19821984), a Woodville City Councilman (19841989), Chairman of the Tyler County Republican Party (19901995), a member of the Woodville Independent School District Board (19921995) and Director of the Tyler County Chamber of Commerce.[1] He has also served as President of the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (19811987), on the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (19821984) and on the Texas Historical Commission (19891995).[1][7] In 1999, he was appointed by Governor Bush to the Lower Neches Valley Authority and was reappointed to the body by Governor Rick Perry, most recently in 2013, for a term that expired in 2019.[1][8][9] He resigned before being sworn in to Congress.
When twelve-term Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson of Texas's 2nd congressional district decided to retire in 1996, Babin ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, he came second out of five candidates, with 7,094 votes (31.01%), behind Donna Peterson, the nominee for the seat in 1990, 1992 and 1994, who took 8,047 votes (35.18%). As no candidate secured a majority, Babin faced Peterson in a runoff, and defeated her 7,405 votes (66.83%) to 3,675 (33.16%). In the general election, he lost to Democrat Jim Turner, a State Senator and former State Representative, by 102,908 votes (52.24%) to 89,838 (45.6%).
After the 1996 election, Babin became involved in a campaign finance scandal concerning $37,000 in illegal donations from businessman Peter Cloeren that were moved through ""vehicles"" to circumvent the individual contribution limit of $1,000. Cloeren asserted in an affidavit that Babin and then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay laundered his donations through other candidates and organisations.[10][11] Babin and DeLay denied his allegations.[12] Cloeren pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and paid a $400,000 fine and received a two-year suspended prison sentence. Babin paid a $20,000 civil penalty and paid back $5,000 in excessive contributions for ""accepting an excessive contribution and a contribution in the name of another and failing to disclose financial activity properly.""[13]
Babin sought a rematch with Turner in 1998. Unopposed in the Republican primary, he was again defeated in the general election, by 81,556 votes (58.42%) to 56,891 (40.75%).
During the campaign, Babin's campaign manager was 21-year-old Jon-Marc McDonald. McDonald gained national attention when he simultaneously came out of the closet as a gay man and resigned as campaign manager.[6][14] In August 1998, McDonald abruptly stepped down, citing ""irreconcilable differences"" with Babin over the issue of homosexuality.[6][15] According to The Dallas Morning News, McDonald announced his resignation via press release without discussing it with Babin, and his sudden departure left those in the campaign shocked and confused.[16][17][18]
McDonald generated further press coverage when he stated in an interview after his resignation that Babin had made disparaging remarks about homosexuals in private, which Babin adamantly denied.[19] In some press reports, Babin claimed that McDonald was not the campaign manager, but instead a ""volunteer coordinator"", also a paid position.[19] An article by Hastings Wyman of the Southern Political Report suggested that McDonald was forced to resign by the local media threatening to ""out"" him.[20] The resignation received widespread national media attention because of the sensationalistic way it transpired.[21]
After Republican Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas's 36th congressional district made a late decision to run for the U.S. Senate instead of for re-election, Babin ran to succeed him in the 2014 elections.[22] In the twelve-candidate Republican primary, Babin finished first with 17,194 votes (33.36%). As he did not receive a majority, he proceeded to a runoff with the second-placed candidate, mortgage banker and candidate for Texas's 10th congressional district in 2004 Ben Streusand, who had received 12,024 votes (23.33%). In the runoff, Babin defeated Streusand by 19,301 votes (57.84%) to 14,069 (42.16%).[23] He then faced Democrat Michael Cole in the general election,[24] defeating him by 100,933 votes (75.97%) to 29,291 (22.04%).[25]
Source: [26]
On January 6, 2015, Babin was one of twenty-five House Republicans to vote against John Boehner's re-election as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was re-elected with 216 votes.[27] 24 Republicans voted for another candidate and Babin voted ""present"", effectively abstaining from the vote.[28] Two days later, Babin explained his vote. He said that he didn't want to vote for Boehner, to reflect dissatisfaction with the Speaker in his district, particularly over the Cromnibus. However, he declined to vote for another candidate because ""he would have preferred to see Boehner denied reelection on the first ballot, forcing a closed-door GOP caucus meeting at which a replacement might emerge.""[29]
On January 25, in an interview with The Daily Caller, Babin said that President Barack Obama ""deserves impeachment"", but he doubted that Congress would act on that. He also criticised President Obama's foreign policy, calling him an ""appeaser deluxe"".[30]
Babin cites water conservation, repealing the Affordable Care Act and stopping illegal immigration as his main priorities.[4] He believes in the Protestant work ethic and the concept of ""if you dont work, you dont eat, if you are able to work."" He supports term limits and wants to reduce the number of out of wedlock births and restore the traditional family unit.[4] He also believes that taxes are too high and the tax code is too complex.[4]
Although Babin helped found and is a member of the Tyler County Patriots, he does not identify as a member of the Tea Party, saying ""I believe with all my heart in less government, lower taxes and more individual responsibility and more economic freedom, and you can put whatever label you want to on it.""[5]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.


Rob Bishop was born in Kaysville, Utah and graduated from Davis High School. He served as a Mormon missionary in Germany from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1974. He taught civics classes at Brigham City's Box Elder High School from 1974 to 1980; he next taught German in Ogden, Utah at Ben Lomond High School; then he returned to teaching government and history classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002. [1] While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the Close Up Foundation to help students participate in Close Up's Washington, DC based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.
Bishop was a member of the Utah State House of Representatives. He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994. In 1997 he was elected chairman of the Utah Republican Party, and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington. After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught advanced placement courses while chairing the history department.
In 2002, he was elected with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.[1]
As a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools. He opposes No Child Left Behind and supports school vouchers. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.
From 2008-2010 Rob Bishop served as Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, where he advocated for multiple use of public lands and the need for fewer restrictions and mandates that limit use.
In May 2010 Rob Bishop joined with other conservative House members to launch the 10th Amendment Task Force. The Task Force aims to educate Congress and the public about the concept of Federalism.
As a Member of Congress, Rob Bishop has introduced legislation to increase domestic energy production in the United States, such as the 3-D energy bill.[2] Ever a proponent of Multiple use parks over single use parks, he leveraged his position as Chairman of the Subcommittee over National Parks, Forests and Public Lands to stop the Department of Interior from designating areas as new de facto wilderness areas known as Wild Lands.[3]
In February 2011, Bishop introduced an amendment during the debate on a continuing budget resolution for fiscal year 2011 that would have prohibited the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from spending federal funds on the National Landscape Conservation System.[4] After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,[5] Bishop withdrew it before the continuing budget resolution was voted on.
In mid-2011, after touring of the U.S. Mexico border, Rob Bishop led the charge on introducing a border security bill, H.R. 1505 the National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act. This bill gives the U.S. Border Patrol the authority to override specific environmental laws in order to allow the U.S. Border Patrol greater access to some of the most highly trafficked areas along the border. U.S. Border Patrol agents have cited that their efforts to address rampant criminal activity along the border have been hampered by environmental laws. The bill passed the House Natural Resources Committee and has not yet been brought before the full U.S. House of Representatives for a vote.
Similarly Congressman Bishop co-sponsored a bill put forth by House Majority whip Kevin McCarthy to remove regulations from 43million acres (170,000km2) of Forest Service Roadless Areas and Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use purposes.
Well known for his fashionable three piece suits, Congressman Bishop became the third best dressed congressmen in 2012 according to an article written in the Washingtonian.[6]
In 2013 Congressman Bishop announced the establishment of the Utah Public Lands Initiative.[7] According to a staff report[8] prepared by the offices of Congressman Rob Bishop, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, and Congressman Chris Stewart, the Utah Public Lands Initiative is a locally driven initiative to bring resolution to some of the most challenging land disputes in the State of Utah. The initiative is rooted in the believe that conservation and economic development can coexist to make Utah a better place to live, work, and visit.[9]
In February 2014 House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings announced that he will retire at the close of the 113th Congress.[10] Congressman Bishop is rumored to be a top contender for the Chairmanship.[11]
On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act (H.R. 1459; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to subject national monument declarations by the President to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).[12] At present, the President of the United States can unilaterally declare something a national monument, whereas the United States Congress is required to follow a more rigorous series of procedures to gather input from the public.[13]
In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.[12] Bishop argued that ""the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President"". He claims his new bill would ensure ""that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input"".[13]
Bishop is the co-founder of the Western State Coalition, a states' rights organization.[citation needed]
Bishop is married to Jeralynn Hansen, a former Miss Peach Queen for Brigham City, Utah, where he and his family currently live.[16] They have five children  four sons and one daughter. All his sons' names can be found in the Book of Mormon.[citation needed]"
"398","","2013","1960","Utah 2","Utah State University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stewart_(politician)","Chris Stewart","Republican","Author, businessman","Mormon","Christopher Douglas ""Chris"" Stewart (born July 15, 1960) is an American author, businessman, and politician known for his bestsellers Seven Miracles That Saved America and The Miracle of Freedom: Seven Tipping Points That Saved the World. He currently represents Utah's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.
Stewart graduated from Utah State University in 1984 before joining the United States Air Force. During his time in the Air Force, Stewart set three world speed records including the fastest nonstop flight around the world.[2] After his service, Stewart began writing novels and became the President and CEO of the Shipley Group. His New York Times bestsellers, Seven Miracles That Saved America and The Miracle of Freedom were published on October 14, 2009[3] and June 3, 2011.[4] He formally announced his candidacy for Congress on December 6, 2011.


Stewart was born in Logan, Utah, and grew up on a dairy farm in Cache Valley, an agricultural valley of northern Utah and southeastern Idaho. His father was a retired Air Force Pilot and teacher. His mother, Sybil S. Stewart, was a full-time homemaker and was recognized as the Utah Mother of the Year in 1996.[5]
Stewart graduated from Sky View High School in 1978 and entered Utah State University in the fall of the same year. After a year in college, Stewart took a break and served as a Mormon missionary in Texas. After his church service, Stewart re-entered Utah State University, and in 1984 earned a degree in economics from the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business.
Stewart served in the Air Force for 14 years, primarily flying rescue helicopters and the B-1B bomber. He was stationed at Dyess Air Force Base, Mountain Home Air Force Base, and other Air Force bases.
After college, Stewart was accepted into the Air Force's Officer Training School. He was also accepted into Undergraduate Pilot Training. Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Graduate (top of the class) in both endeavors. As the distinguished graduate, Stewart was trained to fly helicopters and jet-aircraft. Only two officers are accepted into this dual-training program per year.
In 1995, Stewart was awarded the Mackay Trophy for ""significant aerial achievement"" for the combat capability operation known as Coronet Bat. On June 3, 1995, Chris and a flight of two B-1s set the world record for the fastest non-stop flight around the world. Stewart was the senior project officer for this mission. The purpose of the mission was to demonstrate the capability of the B-1 Lancer with live bombing activity over three bombing ranges on three continents in two hemispheres.[6] In the process, the team set three world records, flying 36,797.65 kilometers in 36 hours 13 minutes.[7]
The mission was recounted in the film Supersonic Saints: Thrilling Stories from LDS Pilots.[8]
After his military career, Stewart turned to the private sector. He was the president and CEO of the Shipley Group, a consulting company that specializes in energy and environmental issues.[9] Shipley also participates in government anti-terrorism training, corporate security and executive preparedness consulting. He sold Shipley Group in December 2012 just prior to being sworn in as a U.S. Congressman representing Utah's 2nd congressional district.[10]
Stewart first began writing books in the late nineties. His first novel, Shattered Bone, was published October 1, 1998.[11] Stewart wrote four additional techno-thrillers before he began writing the series The Great and Terrible. Before completing his last book in that series, he started writing historical novels. His book Seven Miracles That Saved America was chosen as ""Book of the Month"", and The Miracle of Freedom: Seven Tipping Points That Saved the World became a New York Times Bestseller within two weeks of publication, and was selected for the National Communications Award by the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge. The Miracle of Freedom and Seven Miracles That Saved America were co-written with his brother Ted Stewart. The Miracle of Freedom was endorsed by radio/talk show host Glenn Beck, and Beck's coverage is credited with the book becoming a bestseller.[12][13]
Stewart has written fourteen books, and has been chosen by the Book of the Month Club.[14][15] His works have been published in twelve countries.[16]
He has worked with Elizabeth Smart to co-write her memoir, My Story.[17]
In 2005, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performed A Christmas Bell for Anya, which he co-authored with his wife Evie.[18][19][20]
On October 21, 2011, Utah Policy wrote that Stewart was going to run for Congress in Utah's 2nd congressional district.[21] His formal announcement took place on December 6, 2011.[22][23] On April 21, 2012, he secured the Republican nomination.
Stewart won the race with 62% of the vote, defeating Jay Seegmiller, and took office on January 3, 2013.
Source: [2]
Stewart has sponsored eight bills of his own, including:[24]
Stewart cosponsored the Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2413; 113th Congress) and sponsored the substitute amendment which replaced the text of the original legislation. Stewart said the bill ""prioritizes protection of public safety and forward-looking weather research, improves procurement of observing system data from space, air, and land, and opens up NOAA's process to encourage private sector weather solutions.""[25]
Stewart is the sponsor of H.R. 1422, titled the ""EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2014"", which would reform the composition and activities of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) science advisory board. At least 10% of the members of the board would be required to be from state, local, or tribal governments. Corporate and industry experts would no longer be excluded from the board and board members would be prohibited from advising the EPA in discussions that cite their work. While the bill's supporters believe that it would increase transparency and balance in the EPA, critics argue that it ""turns the idea of conflict of interest on its head"" and would restrict scientists' ability to provide proper advice to the government.[26][27]
In an interview regarding the Bundy standoff of April and May 2014, Stewart stated his opinion that the Bureau of Land Management could have avoided the standoff by allowing local sheriffs to intervene. Citing concerns about the level of weaponry carried by federal agents, he also sponsored a bill (H.R.4934) to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies.[28][29]"
"399","","2009","1967","Utah 3","Brigham Young University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Chaffetz","Jason Chaffetz","Republican","Business relations executive","Mormon","Jason E Chaffetz (/tefts/; born March 26, 1967) is the U.S. Representative for Utah's 3rd congressional district, first elected in 2008. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Chaffetz was born in Los Gatos, California and raised in Arizona and Colorado with his younger brother Alex. His father, John Chaffetz, was Jewish and his mother was a Christian Scientist. Chaffetz converted from Judaism to Mormonism during his last year of college.[1] He attended Brigham Young University (BYU) on an athletic scholarship, and was the starting placekicker on the BYU football team in 1988 and 1989. He still holds the BYU individual records for most extra points attempted in a game, most extra points made in a game, and most consecutive extra points made in a game.[2] Chaffetz graduated from the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications in 1989 with a B.A. in communications.[3]
During his college years, Chaffetz was a Democrat. His father had previously been married to Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis's wife, Katherine, and his half-brother is former actor John Dukakis.[4] Despite their different political affiliations, Chaffetz remains close with his brother and the Dukakis family.[5] While a student at BYU, he was a Utah co-chairman for Michael Dukakis's 1988 campaign for U.S. President. After college, Chaffetz worked in public relations for multi-level marketing company Nu Skin International for about a decade.[6][7]
Chaffetz became a Republican after meeting Ronald Reagan in 1990, when Reagan visited Chaffetz's employer, Nu Skin, as a motivational speaker. However, his political views had been drifting more to the right even while working for Dukakis.[8]
In 2004, Chaffetz was the campaign manager for Utah gubernatorial candidate Jon Huntsman. Huntsman won the race and after he took office in January 2005, Chaffetz became his chief of staff.[9] In November 2005 Chaffetz left to manage his own company, ""Maxtera Utah"", a corporate communications and marketing company.
In 2007, Chaffetz was appointed by Governor Huntsman as a Trustee for Utah Valley University. He has also served as its President, a member of the Highland City Planning Commission, and as the Chairman for the Utah National Guard Adjutant General Review.
On January 1, 2007, before the 110th Congress was even seated, Jason Chaffetz announced he was ""testing the waters"" for a Congressional run against six-term incumbent, Chris Cannon, for the Republican nomination in this heavily Republican district.[10][11] Nine months later, on October 1, 2007, Chaffetz formally entered the race for the Republican nomination. That same day, David Leavitt issued a press release announcing his campaign had raised $100,000 to challenge Cannon.[12] Leavitt, brother to popular 3-term Utah Governor and Bush Administration cabinet member Mike Leavitt, more than doubled Chaffetz in fundraising for that quarter.[13] A March 2008 Deseret News/KSL TV poll by Dan Jones & Associates released two days before the party caucuses showed Jason Chaffetz with 4% support.[14]
After the nearly 1200 3rd District delegates were elected on March 25, 2008, Chaffetz sent a mailer telling delegates he would run a different kind of campaign. He would have no paid staff, no campaign office, no free meals for delegates, no campaign debt and no polling. He committed to spend between $70 and $80 per delegate, telling voters, ""How you run your campaign is indicative of how you're going to be in office.""[15][16]
Although Cannon was one of the most conservative members of the House, Chaffetz ran well to his right. He said that Cannon has failed us for not instituting conservative principles"", consistently calling for a return to the core conservative principles of fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability and a strong national defense. He campaigned on stronger measures to fix legal immigration and remove the incentives for illegal immigration, an issue he continued to press throughout the campaign.[4][17] The week before the convention, David Leavitt told the Salt Lake Tribune, ""If Jason Chaffetz beats me [at the convention], Chris Cannon will be the congressman. Jason Chaffetz has no resources, no organization.""[18]
At the May 10, 2008 Utah Republican State Convention Chaffetz won 59% of the 3rd District's delegates to Cannon's 41%. He came just a few hundred votes short of tallying 60% of the delegates and winning the nomination without a primary.[19]
In the primary, polls showed a close race. A Dan Jones poll released May 22, 2008 showed Cannon leading Chaffetz 39 percent to 37 percent among likely voters.[20] A subsequent poll released June 21 showed a statistical tie, favoring Cannon 44-40 with a 5.5% margin of error.[21] On June 24, 2008, Chaffetz defeated Cannon by a vote of 60% to 40%.[22] It was considered an upset victory as Cannon was endorsed by George W. Bush,[23] the state's two U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett, and nearly all of the state Republican establishment. Cannon also outspent Chaffetz by 6 to 1.[24] Cannon's primary defeat spurred worry among Republican incumbents.[25]
Chaffetz faced Democrat Bennion Spencer in the 2008 general election, along with Jim Noorlander of the Constitution Party. Chaffetz's firm position against asking for earmarks created some controversy during the general election campaign.[26] Chaffetz said, ""Until there's reform, I will not ask for them. They're a cancer within the system and I want to extract them."" Ultimately, Chaffetz won election with 66% of the vote. However, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress when he won the Republican nomination. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; in 2008 it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+26.
Chaffetz defeated Democratic nominee Karen Hyer and all third-party candidates, garnering 72% of the vote.[27] The Salt Lake Tribune, often critical of Chaffetz, endorsed him in the race, writing, ""U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, has delivered as advertised for Utah's 3rd District.""[28]
In early 2012 Chaffetz worked as a representative of the Mitt Romney presidential campaign during primary season, shadowing the campaign of rival GOP candidate Newt Gingrich to offer rebuttals to reporters following Gingrich speeches.[29] ""I'm just trying to offer a little perspective,"" said Chaffetz at one of Gingrich's Florida stops.[30]
Chaffetz announced at the start of the Congressional term in 2009 that he would be sleeping on a cot in his office rather than renting a Washington, D.C. apartment.[31] Chaffetz said, ""I'm trying to live the example that it doesn't take big dollars in order to get where we want to go. I can save my family $1,500 a month by sleeping on a cot in my office as opposed to getting a fancy place that's maybe a little bit more comfortable.""[31] His family will continue to live in Alpine. ""We are now $10 trillion in debt. $10 trillion. Those are expenses that have to be paid at some point"", he said. If he can tighten his belt in these tough economic times, Chaffetz said, Congress should be able to as well.[31]
Chaffetz appeared on the ""Better Know A District"" segment of The Colbert Report on 6 January 2009, where he was defeated by Stephen Colbert in leg wrestling.[32]
In June 2011, Chaffetz sponsored HR 2560, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011. HR 2560 capped FY 2012 discretionary appropriations at $1.019 trillion, which was $31 billion below FY 2011 discretionary spending, and provided $126.5 billion for war spending. HR 2560 imposed a cap of $681 billion on ""other"" mandatory spending. Excluded from the $681 billion cap were Social Security, Medicare, veterans programs, and interest payments. HR 2560 gradually reduced federal government spending as a percent of gross domestic product from 24.1% in 2011[33] to 21.7% in 2013 and 19.9% in 2021. HR 2560 also allowed for an increase in the debt ceiling of $2.4 trillion, as requested by President Obama, conditioned upon approval by both Houses of Congress of a qualifying Balanced Budget Amendment which would then be sent to the states for approval. HR 2560 passed the House of Representatives but was rejected by the Senate.[34]
In November 2011, Chaffetz announced a seven-point Social Security proposal.[35] The seven provisions include using a chained CPI-W for calculating annual COLAs, increasing normal retirement age, adding progressive price indexing to primary insurance amount calculations, means-testing benefits for high income beneficiaries, increasing the number of years for calculating average indexed monthly earnings, indexing special minimum benefits to wages instead of CPI, and increasing benefits by 5% for retirees when they reach age 85.[36]
In January 2010, Chaffetz was called upon to question President Obama at a meeting of the GOP Conference.[37] Chaffetz applauded Obama for some of the promises made during the campaign, but asked why promises to broadcast healthcare debates on CSPAN, keep lobbyists out of senior positions, go line-by-line through the health care bill and end earmarks had not been kept. Video of the Q&A went viral and received extensive media coverage.[38][39][40][41] Upon hearing that U.S. President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize on October 9, 2009, Chaffetz said he had ""lost all respect for the award"", saying ""it used to be one of distinction, but [now] it is hard to give it any credibility"".[42]
In November 2009 Chaffetz co-sponsored a bill in the House with Rep. Jim Matheson to block the importation of foreign nuclear waste into the United States, putting him directly at odds with Rep. Rob Bishop and Utah's Senators Bennett and Hatch, who had historically supported importing foreign nuclear waste into Utah with restrictions.[43]
In December 2009, Chaffetz championed legislation to limit the use of full-body imaging scanners at airports unless a metal detector first indicated a need for more screening. The images have come under intense scrutiny from privacy groups for allegedly letting security administrators view images of undressed passengers.[44]
Chaffetz and TSA have had a rocky relationship since he joined Congress. In his freshman year, in what critics have described as political grandstanding, he accused TSA agents at his hometown airport in Salt Lake City of unfairly targeting him to pass through a full-body scanning machine  a device Chaffetz believes is invasive. The Republican lawmaker said he believed he was targeted partially for his opposition to granting TSA screeners collective bargaining rights. The union representing some of the officers said at the time that agents followed proper procedure and that an officer who had recently returned from military service in Iraq didnt recognize Chaffetz.[45]
Chaffetz criticized the surge of 30,000 troops President Obama authorized for the war in Afghanistan, saying that the United States does not have a clear policy or exit strategy.[46][47][48]
Chaffetz has been outspoken against the White House and State Departments handling of the attacks on the US Consulate compound. The Administration first stated the attacks were sparked by a spontaneous protest, then later stated the violence was a planned terrorist attack. ""There was a very conscious decision made, I believe  my personal opinion is that they wanted the appearance of 'normalization' there in Libya and building up of an infrastructure, putting up barbed wire on our facility would lead to the wrong impression. Something that this administration didnt want to have moving forward.""[49]
He has criticized UN Ambassadors Susan Rices initial comments calling them somewhere between an outrageous lie and total falsehood.[49]
Chaffetz himself has been criticized for politicizing the Benghazi incident, acknowledging in an interview with CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien that he had ""voted to cut the funding for embassy security"" and that House Republicans had consciously voted to reduce the funds allocated to the State Department for embassy security since winning the majority in 2010. ""Absolutely,"" Chaffetz said. ""Look we have to make priorities and choices in this country.""[50]
Chaffetz has pledged to vote against what he calls ""trivial resolutions,"" including those dealing with sports, such as congratulating the winning team of the Super Bowl. Chaffetz feels that the House could be taking up more important legislation.[51]
Chaffetz opposes federal protection for Utah's resident Greater Sage Grouse, a bird whose population has shrunk from 16 million 100 years ago to about 200,000 today. In 2007, a court ruled that political tampering by Julie A. MacDonald, then-deputy assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, had ""tainted"" the bird's assessment, and a new review was ordered. In March 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar assigned the bird ""warranted but precluded"" status, paving the way for its future protection.[52]
In February of 2015 Chaffetz threatened Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser with possible jail time if she implements Initiative 71. The ballot initiative would legalize small amounts of cannabis in the district and was approved by about 64.87 percent of the voters in 2014.[53][54]"

She is the first Haitian American and the first African American female Republican in Congress,[1][2] as well as the first African American to be elected to Congress from Utah.[3]
Born to Haitian parents in Brooklyn, New York, Love was elected as the Mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, serving from 2010 to 2014. She was previously on its city council. In 2012, Love ran for Utah's 4th congressional district, losing narrowly to incumbent Democratic Representative Jim Matheson. She was a speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention. She was elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives on November 4, 2014, defeating Democratic opponent Doug Owens, son of the former Congressman of the same name.[1][2]


Love was born Ludmya Bourdeau on December 6, 1975, to Mary and Jean Maxine Bourdeau in Brooklyn, New York.[4] Both of her parents had emigrated from Haiti in 1973,[5] leaving their two older children behind.[6][7] They spoke no English when they arrived. Her father became a paint-company manager and her mother worked as a nurse.[8]
Love was born shortly before expiration in early 1976 of an immigration law that allowed residents of the Western Hemisphere who immigrated to the United States to gain a US residency permit (green card) if they had a child born there.[6] [9] Some time later, they became naturalized citizens.[10] Her father had been threatened by the Tonton Macoute, the secret police in Haiti, and her parents came to the United States on a tourist visa.[11]
When Love was five, her family moved from Brooklyn to Norwalk, Connecticut.[12] Love attended Norwalk High School.[11] After the family moved to Norwalk, her parents brought her older siblings from Haiti.[2][13]
Love attended the University of Hartford with a half-tuition scholarship.[14] She graduated with a degree in the performing arts. While at the University of Hartford, she was part of the Hartt School's Music Theatre program.[11]
After college, she worked at Sento Corporation and the Ecopass Corporation.[15] She was also a flight attendant with Continental Airlines.[9][16]
Love served as the community spokesperson in an effort to get the developer of her neighborhood in Saratoga Springs to spray against flies.[11]
Love won a seat on the Saratoga Springs City Council (Utah County) in 2003, a city of about 18,000 near Salt Lake City. The small new city was established in 1997 and has had rapid growth. She was the first female Haitian-American elected official in Utah County, Utah; she took office in January 2004.[16] After six years on the Council she was elected Mayor,[17] winning with 861 votes to 594 for her opponent Jeff Francom.[18] During an economic downturn, as part of the city council she had approved a transition from the agriculture tax to municipal tax. She worked with other city council members to cut expenses, reducing the city's shortfall during the economic downturn from $3.5 million to $779,000. Saratoga Springs now has the highest possible bond rating for a city of its size.[19]
Love was elected as Mayor of Saratoga Springs, serving from January 2010 to January 2014.[15] During her term as mayor, Love led the city in dealing with natural disasters, including a wildfire, which was followed shortly afterward by a severe mudslide.[20]
Love ran in Utah's 4th congressional district, which was created after the 2010 Census.[21][22] She competed for the Republican nomination against attorney Jay Cobb and State Reps. Stephen Sandstrom of Orem and Carl Wimmer of Herriman; she won the nomination on April 21, 2012 at the 2012 Utah Republican Party Convention with over 70 percent of the vote. She faced six-term Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in the general election, who was redistricted into the 4th, losing some of his reliably Democratic constituents.
Nationally, Love received campaign support from 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Speaker of the House John Boehner.[23][24]
In August 2012 National Journal named Love one of ""Ten Republicans to follow on Twitter"".[25] When speaking to the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 28, 2012, she discussed lessons learned from her parents, immigrants from Haiti who fled political repression.[26] She said, ""Mr. President, I am here to tell you we are not buying what you are selling in 2012.""[27]
In September 2012, questions arose about her parents' immigrant status. Forbes investigated a claim in an article that month in Mother Jones that no law existed in 1976 that would have allowed Love's parents to become citizens of the United States after her birth. Forbes found that residents of the Western Hemisphere could get long-term residency permits (green cards) if they had a child born in the United States. Mother Jones was forced to issue a correction.[4][6][28] Love did not make her family's papers available for review. In an October 2012 interview, her father said that Mia's birth as a US citizen was key to him and his wife gaining permanent legal status and ultimately citizenship.[11]
Love lost the election to Jim Matheson by 768 votes out of 245,277 votes cast,[29] a difference of 0.31%. She was regarded to have run a weak campaign, switching campaign managers three times, trying to ""nationalize"" the race rather than focus on local issues, and missing interviews and appointments because of rifts in her campaign staff.[30]
In March 2013, Love stated that she was seriously considering another run against Matheson.[31]
In May 2013 she announced she would run in 2014. As of July 2013[update], Love had raised over $475,000 for her campaign.[32]
Love was an opening speaker at the 2013 Western Conservative Summit. She spoke of the need for increased grassroots organization in the GOP, and the need to be independent from the government.[33]
In August 2013, Love was chosen by Newsmax as an ""Up and Comer"" in their list of top ""25 Influential Women of the GOP""[34]
In November 2013, Love acknowledged the growing consensus that the Tea Party needed to shift away from being the ""party of no.""[35] She reiterated her support for the philosophy of the Tea Party and many of its leaders, including fellow Utah Sen. Mike Lee.[36]
On December 17, 2013, Matheson announced that he would not run for re-election. Love's rank shifted to favored candidate. In early October 2014, the National Journal listed Utah's 4th district as the number one most likely district to change hands in November.[37]
In early 2014 Love was made a member of the Republican National Committee's National Advisory Council on African-American outreach.[38] On April 26, 2014 Love won the Republican nomination for the 4th congressional district at the Utah Republican Convention, with 78% of the vote at the convention.[27][39]
On election night, Owens led Love until late in the evening, when she pulled ahead and ultimately won by more than 4,000 votes.[40][27] Owens has said that he may run against Love in 2016.[41]
With the start of the new congress, Love was appointed to the House Financial Services Committee.[42]
Love joined the Congressional Black Caucus in January 2015.[43]
A Tea Party conservative,[30] Love says she favors ""fiscal discipline, limited government, and personal responsibility.""[17] She has also said that she asks herself three questions whenever she approaches an issue: ""Is it affordable? Is it sustainable? Is it my job?""[44] She has said that at her college orientation, Love's father told her: ""Mia, your mother and I never took a handout. You will not be a burden to society. You will give back."" She underscored this philosophy on the campaign trail in 2014 to sum up her conservative views.[45]
Love is pro-life and has been endorsed by the Susan B. Anthony List.[46]
Love proposes deep cuts to federal spending, particularly in the area of entitlement spending (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid).[30] She also supports cutting taxes.[30]
Love supported domestic energy exploration, local control of education, Second Amendment rights, and state control of public lands.[47]
While campaigning in 2012, Love had said that if elected, she would join the Congressional Black Caucus and try to take that thing apart from the inside out. She has described the mainly Democratic Caucus as characterized by
...demagoguery. They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isnt. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that everybody is going to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility.""[48]
Raised a Roman Catholic, Love joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after graduating from college in 1998.[49] While working as a flight attendant, she moved to Utah as part of her work. She also wanted to be closer to the temple and to learn more about her faith.[11] There she got to know Jason Love, whom she had met briefly when he was an LDS missionary in Connecticut.
The two were married in December 1998, four months after their first date. Love turned down an offer to appear in the Broadway show Smokey Joe's Caf that would start two days before her marriage.[11][50] When first married, the Loves lived in American Fork. They have three children together. The Loves decided that Jason should continue his software work and maintain their residence in Utah.[51]"

University of California, Berkeley","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch","Peter Welch","Democratic","Vermont Senate President Pro Tempore","Roman Catholic","Peter Francis Welch (born May 2, 1947) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who has served as the U.S. Representative for Vermont's at-large congressional district since 2007.
He previously served in the Vermont Senate from 1981 to 1989, where he had spells as the Minority Leader and President pro tempore. In 1988 he gave up his seat to run for the House of Representatives, losing in the Democratic primary to House Majority Leader Paul N. Poirier. He was the Democratic nominee for Governor in 1990, losing to former Republican Governor Richard A. Snelling by 52% to 46%.
He returned to politics in 2001 when he was appointed back to the Vermont Senate. He was re-elected in 2002 and 2004 before making a successful run for the House of Representatives in 2006 to replace Independent Congressman Bernie Sanders, who was elected to the United States Senate.


Welch was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1947, where he attended local Catholic schools (Holy Name Grammar School and Cathedral High School). He graduated magna cum laude from College of the Holy Cross in 1969 and in 1973 earned a law degree from Boalt Hall, the law school of the University of California, Berkeley.[1]
He was a partner for 30 years in the personal injury law firm Welch, Graham & Manby, White River Junction, Vermont.[1] Welch's legal career is the basis for the legal adventures of one of the lead characters in Jacob M. Appel's satiric novel, The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up (2012).[2] [3]
Welch is married to Margaret Cheney, a former member of the Vermont House of Representatives who was appointed to the Vermont Public Service Board in 2013.[4] His first wife, Joan Smith, died of cancer in 2004. Welch had five stepchildren from his first marriage and now has three stepchildren in his second.
In 1980, Welch was elected to the Vermont Senate as a representative from Windsor County. In his second term, Welch was chosen as the Minority Leader, and was chosen as President pro tempore after Democrats gained control of the Senate.[1] Welch was the first Democrat to serve as Vermont's Senate President, since Vermont was a bastion for the Whigs and then the Republicans for more than 100 years beginning in the 1830s.[5]
In 1988, Welch left the Vermont Senate to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Vermont's at-large congressional district.
In 1990, Welch won the Democratic nomination for governor of Vermont, but lost in the general election to Republican Richard Snelling.[1]
Welch did not run for another office for more than a decade; in 2001 he was appointed by Governor Howard Dean to fill a vacant Vermont Senate seat in Windsor County. He was elected to the seat in 2002 and reelected in 2004, again serving as president pro tempore.[1]
When Vermont's lone U.S. House member, Bernie Sanders decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 2006, Welch chose to run for Sanders' seat. He defeated Republican Martha Rainville in the November 7, 2006 general election 53% to 45% in a race where both candidates pledged to be entirely positive.[6] Welch was technically the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the House since 1961, and only the second since 1853 (though Sanders caucused with the Democrats).
Welch was re-elected in 2008 with no major-party opposition, becoming the first Democrat to be reelected to the House from Vermont in 158 years. He was in the unusual position of being both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the seat, due to Republican voters writing his name in on the blank primary ballot.[7]
Welch was re-elected with 64% of the vote against Republican nominee Paul Beaudry, Liberty Union nominee Jane Newton, Working Families nominee Sheila Coniff, and Independent candidate Gus Jaccaci.
Welch easily defeated Republican nominee Mark Donka, Liberty Union candidate Jane Newton, and Independent candidates James ""Sam"" Desrochers and Andre LaFramboise with 72% of the vote.
Welch was re-elected to a fifth term with 64.4% of the vote Republican Mark Donka, Matthew Andrews of the Liberty Union Party and Independents Cris Ericson, Randall Meyer and Jerry Trudell.
Welch worked with former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on a bill to increase funding at the National Institutes of Health for pediatric research and with Republican Congressman Paul Ryan to reverse proposed regulations that would have banned the use of wooden shelves for ageing cheese wheels. He touts his bipartisanship and describes himself as ""very independent"". He bucked his party leadership by voting against arming and training Syrian rebels and opposes ""boots on the ground"" in dealing with ISIL. He believes climate change is a ""glaring problem"", opposes travel bans in response to the Ebola epidemic and supports immigration reform that addresses border concerns but does not close them.[8]
A September, 2007 search of the Library of Congress Thomas congressional bill search engine revealed Welchs sponsorship of amendments on the following topics (among others):
9.29.08 - Welch votes against Wall Street bailout Washington, D.C. - Rep. Peter Welch issued the following statement in opposition to the Wall Street bailout. Welch voted no on H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008:
""The economic crisis we face is real. However, I voted against the bailout because it isn't paid for and because I don't believe it will work.
Welch later voted in favor of a new version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act numbered H.R. 1424.
According to Ontheissues.org, Welch voted YES, as follows on key issues:
As of September 2007, Welchs congressional website depicted his stand on issues and legislation, as follows:
One website that tracks congressional votes, Ontheissues.org, reported in September 2007 that Welch believes that an abortion decision should be between a woman and her doctor. His campaign website for 2006 claimed that he had a 100 percent National [Rifle] Association record.
In his first term, Welch attracted attention for his partnership with Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) in challenging colleges and universities with enormous endowments to spend more of those funds for operating expenses (including, perhaps, lower tuition.)[9]
One area where Welch has been at odds with vocal constituents is the matter of impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney. Welch has expressed the opinion that ending the war in Iraq is a top priority, and impeachment would distract the Congress from addressing that outcome. Advocates of impeachment protested in Welch's Vermont offices.[10]
On the Iraq War, the Vermont Guardian quoted Welch as saying, ""If were going to end the war were going to have to move beyond the 218 votes [216 Democrats and 2 Republicans, who voted for a war funding bill that included a withdrawal timetable] There is united Democratic opposition to the war and only two Republicans voted for accountability, no blank check, and a timetable. There are some folks who believe impeachment is a way to end the war, but my major reservation is that impeachment is one approach guaranteed to solidify Republican opposition.""
On impeachment, the Vermont Guardian quoted Welch as saying, ""My hat is off to the citizen activists in Vermont for bringing their case to the Legislature; they are representative of the proud tradition we have in Vermont to speaking out. .... People are expressing broad outrage about this presidents handling of the war, his treatment of civil liberties, and the use of bogus intelligence, and there is a lot of common ground here on holding the president and vice president accountable. The major question is the best way to make that happen.... My fundamental concern is ending this war.""
Welch endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in 2008.
Welch supports a Progressive Democratic position on most issues, as evidenced by his high ratings by Progressive interest groups and low ratings by conservative ones.[11]
On the issue of abortion, Welch was given a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the National Right to Life Committee gave him a rating of 0.[11] Welch voted no on the November 7, 2009 amendment to President Obama's health care bill that prohibited federally funded abortions.[12] On the issue of gay rights, PFLAG and the Human Rights campaign rated Welch as 100% supportive of their position.[11] Welch has sustained a liberal stance on the issues of abortion and gay rights despite his identification as a Roman Catholic.[13]
Several organizations such as Americans for Fair Taxation and the National Taxpayers Union gave Welch 0 percent or F ratings. Though these organizations state they are nonpartisan, their pressure for a flatter tax rate has garnered them support from mostly Republican politicians.[14] Welch also voted no on the 2009-2010 Defense Spending Appropriations bill.[12]
Despite Welchs Progressive positions on social issues and his low ratings from traditionally conservative interest groups, Welch has adopted a conservative position on gun rights. Welch supported a bill to allow loaded guns in National Parks as well as a bill to repeal part of the DC firearms ban.[12] He received an A from the National Rifle Association, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him 0 percent.[11]
Welch stresses the importance of veterans' support on his website and in his voting record. In July, 2009, Welch supported legislation to help disabled veterans.[15] He also frequently introduces and supports legislation to help Vermont veterans, such as the April, 2009 resolution to honor Captain Richard Phillips, a navy captain from Underhill Vermont, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates but returned safely.[16] Welch also received an ""A"" rating from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America organization.[11]
In addition, on his website, Peter Welch states he believes in affordable access to quality health care as a fundamental right. Three key principles he strives for in health care are that everyone should be covered, everyone should contribute based upon their ability, and coverage should be independent of employers.[17]
According to Representative Welchs May 5, 2010 entry on the Hill's Congress Blog,[18] he believes in the importance in energy efficiency. Welch said he supports putting effort into creating energy efficiency and alternative energy sources,which will create more jobs for those in need and will also greatly reduce the cost of energy bills, among other things.
As of late, Welch has been pushing for Congress to pass legislation allowing Vermont to receive federal funding to repair highways and roads damaged by Tropical Storm Irene. He has joined a coalition of 50 Democratic and Republican House members from states affected by Irene in order to make his case in Congress. He has advocated for the Republicans and Democrats to work together on many of the key issues plaguing our country today.[19]"

It is nicknamed ""America's First District"" because the site of Jamestown is located there.[2]


Wittman was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Regina C. ""Genia"" (ne Wood) and Frank Joseph Wittman. His father was of German descent and his mother's ancestors included immigrants from Ireland and Canada.[3] He grew up in Westmoreland County, Virginia.

Wittman served on the Montross Town Council from 1986 to 1996 and as Mayor of the Town of Montross from 1992 to 1996. Two of his major accomplishments in this office were the overhaul of the sewage system and the development of a computerized system for tax billing.

He is a member of the Republican Party.


Rigell was raised in Titusville, Florida. He served for six years in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 19781984, attaining the rank of Sergeant. His father served in the Marines in World War II, landing on Iwo Jima, and his son is a Marine. He holds an A.A. from Brevard Community College, a B.B.A. from Mercer University, and a M.B.A. from Regent University.[3]
He and his wife Teri live in Virginia Beach and have four children.[4]
Prior to his election to Congress, Rigell and his wife Teri established, and continue to own, two new car dealerships under the name Freedom Automotive, one in Norfolk and the other in Chesapeake/Virginia Beach.[5]
Rigell won the Republican nomination in a six-way race. The Hill rated his primary race as one of the top seven Congressional primaries for that election cycle.[6] Rigell was considered by many to be the favorite in the primary,[7]because he had support from the National Republican Congressional Committee[8] and Eric Cantor[9] - at least after the primary,[10] and was endorsed by Republican Virginia governor Bob McDonnell.[11]
Rigell came under attack from his primary opponents for the dealerships he owns having sold 138 cars under the Cash for Clunkers program, which Rigell subsequently criticized as ""reckless bailouts and an out-of-control federal debt."" Rigell noted that buyers, not dealers, received program subsidies for trading up to a more fuel-efficient vehicle. A spokesman said that Rigell felt an obligation to the people who work for him, and his customers.[12] He also came under attack for making campaign contributions to Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries and to Virginia Democrat Louise Lucas in her bid against Randy Forbes.[13] Rigell said he believed that Hillary Clinton would have been a worse option for President.[14]
Rigell states that his top priority is reducing government spending and that he supports replacing the health care law with market-based reforms.[15] As of June 4, 2010, Rigell had contributed $775,000 of his personal wealth to his campaign.[13] Rigell defeated Democratic incumbent Glenn Nye for Virginia's 2nd congressional district.
Rigell was challenged by businessman and Democratic nominee Paul Hirschbiel.
Rigell was challenged by Democrat Suzanne Patrick in the general election.
Rigell said he will focus on economic issues over social issues in the 2014 election. He stated, ""I wake up every day not thinking about the social issues. I sought office because I know we can do better on job creation and Im also concerned about our fiscal trajectory."" He added, ""I think as part of that were strengthening things that are important to women and, of course, to men as well. Early childhood education, making sure that our children are safe and they have great opportunities once they get out of high school or college.""[16]
Representative Rigell states he is ""proudly pro-life"",[17] he opposes gay marriage and opposed the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""[18] In 2011, Rigell cosponsored bills to prohibit abortion coverage under the national Affordable Health Care law, prohibit the use of federal funds for Planned Parenthood and prohibit taxpayer funding of abortion. Rigell voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.[19] Rigell has refused to endorse Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor E.W. Jackson in light of anti-gay comments made by Jackson.[20]
Rigell's district includes the largest concentration of active duty and retired service members in the United States. He supported the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Act, which the House and Senate passed. This bill increased the rate of compensation for veterans who were disabled in active duty.[21] Representative Rigell supports the continued military effort in Afghanistan; he opposed a vote in 2011 to remove troops from the country. However, he also opposed deploying ground troops to Libya, and has joined a bipartisan coalition urging President Obama and Congress to resist calls for a quick and easy military intervention in Iraq..[22][23]
In 2011, Rigell called the Presidents use of force in Libya unconstitutional, stating that the military action violated the War Powers Resolution of 1973 since Congress was not consulted. Rigell simultaneously introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense FY'12 Appropriations bill to defund U.S. military operations in Libya, but the amendment failed in the House.
In 2013, following an alleged chemical attack by the Assad Regime in Syria, Rigell wrote a letter to the President urging him to consult Congress, as prescribed by the War Powers Resolution, before authorizing the use of any military force overseas. He was joined by 139 Members of the House of Representatives, 21 of whom were Democrats.[24]
Rigell also supported a bipartisan congressional resolution advocating for the United Nations (UN) to create a Syrian War Crimes Tribunal.[25] The bipartisan resolution, introduced by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, called for an immediate ceasefire in Syria and directed the President to work with the UN to set up a tribunal to investigate war crimes committed by both the Syrian government and rebel groups in the country.
Representative Rigell supported Paul Ryan's budget plan, Path to Prosperity, which called for repeal of the 2010 Healthcare legislation. He vocally criticized Senate inaction on the House's budget plans in 2011, stating ""Empirically we can show that the bottleneck is in the Senate  I hope every American stands up and says to Senator Reid: get these bills passed, well go to conference, lets work it out, well work weekends and get this thing moving again.""[26] Ultimately, he voted in favor of S 627, the 2011 budget proposal which raised the debt ceiling and required a supercommittee to provide more concrete spending cuts.
Billionaire Warren Buffett challenged the GOP that he would match any donations to the Treasury they give. Rigell had already been giving back 15% of his salary, and when he flagged this for Buffett, Buffett agreed to match it.[27]
On June 28, 2012, Rigell was one of only two Republicans (along with Steven LaTourette of Ohio) who voted against a motion to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his handling of the ATF gunwalking scandal.[28]"

He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district takes in most of Richmond, all of Portsmouth, along with most of the black-majority areas of Norfolk, Hampton and Scott's home in Newport News.


Scott was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Newport News, Virginia. He is of African American and Filipino American (maternal grandfather) descent.[1]
Scott graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. in government and Boston College Law School with his Juris Doctor. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.
Scott is a former member of the National Guard and Army Reserve.[2] Scott was a lawyer at a private practice from 1973 to 1991.
Scott was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates as a Democrat in 1977 and he was elected to the Senate of Virginia in 1982. While in the Virginia legislature, he worked for greater access to health care for the poor and children, an increased minimum wage, and greater job training. Scott also authored legislation that provides tax credits to business that provide donations to serving local communities in preventing crime or increasing social service delivery.
Scott first ran for Congress in 1986 in the 1st district, which included his home in Newport News. He lost to Republican incumbent U.S. Congressman Herb Bateman 56%-44%.[3]
In 1992, the Department of Justice directed the Virginia legislature to draw a black-majority district after the 1990 census. The legislature responded by shifting most of the black residents of Hampton Roads and Richmond into a newly created 3rd District. Scott won a three-way Democratic primary with 67% of the vote,[4] which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. In the general election, he defeated Republican Dan Jenkins 79%-21%.[5]
During this time period, he won re-election every two years with at least 76% of the vote, except in 2004. That year, he was challenged by Republican Winsome Sears, a former State Delegate. He won with 69% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage of his career. In 1994, Scott won 79.44% of the vote, defeating Republican Thomas E. Ward.

Scott was challenged by Republican Chuck Smith, a former JAG. Scott defeated him 70%-27%,[6] the second worst performance of his career.
After redistricting, Scott's district was made even more safe. Currently, Obama won his district with 76%, while the new district he won with 78% of the vote.[7] Scott faced Air Force officer Dean Longo in the election.[8] Scott easily won an 11th term with 81.26% of the vote.
Scott joined President Obama in kicking off his campaign at Virginia Commonwealth University. The focus of the rally was largely on Obama's timeline for leaving the Middle East.[9]
Scott is the first African American Representative from Virginia since Reconstruction. Also, having a maternal grandfather of Filipino ancestry gives Scott the distinction of being the first American of Filipino descent to serve as a voting member of Congress. Scotts congressional district is the only one with a majority black population in Virginia. The district was created in 1992 and has remained the most Democratic district in Virginia.[10]
Scott's annual Labor Day picnic, generally held at his mother's residence in Newport News, is a major campaign stop for statewide and federal candidates in Virginia.
On November 7, 2009, Scott voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act (HR 3962).
Scott has voted progressively in the House of Representatives. He has supported increases in the minimum wage and has worked to eliminate anti-gay bias in the workplace.[11] In 2010, Scott co-sponsored the ""Lee-Scott bill"" with Barbara Lee to make it easier on individuals who had been on unemployment for 99 weeks without finding work. In regards to the bill, Lee said that ""it is important that we put in place a safety net for those still looking for work. We cannot and will not allow our fellow Americans to fall by the wayside. Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do.""[12]
Scott was an outspoken opponent of the Bush administration. He opposed the Patriot Act explaining that officials may abuse the power by promoting anti-terrorist security and develop unfair racial profiling. In 2002 Scott voted nay on the Iraq war resolution and did not support any of the Bush Doctrine in reference to the Iraq war.[10]
Scott introduced the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1447; 113th Congress) on April 9, 2013.[13] The bill would require the United States Department of Justice to collect data from U.S. states and territories about the deaths of prisoners in their custody.[14] States and territories would face monetary penalties for noncompliance. The bill would also require federal agencies to report on the deaths of prionsers in their custody."

Although the statement was made in response to a direct query from a reporter as to whether he would debate Clark, Hurts campaign later tried to justify their position by insisting this was untrue.[25] Hurt skipped the first debate which was organized by the Senior Statesmen of Virginia, becoming the first candidate to skip the forum since it started in 1996.[26][27] In addition to the first debate, Hurt skipped two subsequent debates one sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in Nelson County and another hosted by American Legion Post 325 in Danville making a total of three skipped debates.[28][29]
Hurt campaigned on his opposition to the Democratic-backed initiatives that Perriello supported, such as health-care reform, the economic stimulus package and clean energy legislation.[30] On August 20, Hurt released his first television ad. Hurt's first television ad stated that he would fight tax increases, stop Washingtons spending and start creating jobs, however he never mentions his opponent. ""You definitely see that hes running against Congress as a whole and Democrats as a whole,"" Isaac Wood, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said. ""That was very clear. He spent just a few seconds introducing himself, then pivoted right away to attack the negative things happening in D.C. With voters, that can be effective.""[31] Another ad from Hurt called Perriello a ""rubber stamp"" for the policies of President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[32] Hurt won with 51percent of the vote.[33]
Hurt was challenged by Democratic nominee John Douglass, a retired United States Air Force Brigadier General and former Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Hurt won re-election to a second term on November 6, 2012.
After his win, Hurt submitted a formal letter of resignation from the Virginia General Assembly to Governor Bob McDonnell that would be effective on January 5, the day Hurt was sworn into Congress.[34] Hurt voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which successfully passed the House.[35] In February, Hurt criticized President Barack Obama's $3.73trillion 2012federal budget proposal for its excessive spending and borrowing.[36] Hurt would vote to pass a $1.2trillion bill that would cut the year's budget federal budget by $61billion.[37] On April 8, Hurt voted for a continuing resolution that prevented the government from shutting down that day.[38] Hurt expressed support for Paul Ryan's budget plan that month as well.[39] On July 19, Hurt voted for the Cut, Cap and Balance Act.[40] On August 1, Hurt voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that raised the debt ceiling and cut spending by $2.1trillion over the next 10years.[41] Hurt co-sponsored a bill that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from cracking down on farm dust. The bill passed the House on December 8.[42]
Virginia Citizens Defense League, a pro-gun organization, gave Hurt an 78% approval rating. Asked if he supports the purchase and possession of guns, Hurt has consistently affirmed his support for gun rights.[43]
Hurt has traditionally voted for legislation that restricts abortion. Virginia Society for Human Rights gave him a 100% approval rating.[44] Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice have consistently given him 0% approval ratings every year since 2002.[44]
Equality Virginia has given him between 0% and 11% approval ratings for his position on LGBT rights.[44]
Hurt has affirmed that he supports capital punishment for certain crimes.[43]
Hurt cosponsored the Balanced Budget Amendment, which did not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be required to spend no more than it takes in, reining in out of control spending once and for all[45] Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and reporting standards.[46] In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions. [47] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee.[47] Hurts position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve. [48]
During 2000-2010, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters gave Hurt an average approval rating of 40%.[44] However, in 2010, when Hurt was running against incumbent Tom Perriello, the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters released television and radio ads against Hurt, attacking him on an alleged conflict of interest regarding uranium mining. However, the ads were deemed to be false by independent fact checkers due to the fact Robert Hurt had no personal investment in uranium mining.[49] Hurt strongly opposed House Speaker Nancy Pelosis 2009 proposed Cap-and Trade climate control legislation.[50] Hurt called on the Virginia Department of Interior secretary Ken Salazar to remove bans on off-shore drilling and development.[51]
Hurt has made it a priority to rein in federal regulation of the private sector. Hurt cosponsored the Farm Dust Prevention Regulation Act,[52] the Preserving Rural Resources Act,[53] and the Supporting Home Owner Rights Enforcement Act.[54] He has voted to ensure that cost-benefit analysis is applied to federal rulemaking and he has voted to roll back currently proposed regulations. Hurt has been a staunch opponent to the Affordable Care Act, of which he says, The Presidents health care law represents a fundamental departure from the founding principles of our nation by placing more faith in government than in the American people and by inserting the federal government in between patients and their doctors. [55]
The following is an incomplete list of major bills sponsored by Rep. Hurt.
Hurt is a descendent of a number of important figures in Virginia and American history, including: founding fathers Robert Morris and George Mason, statesmen Edmund Randolph and John Forsyth, jurists James Mercer and James Markham Marshall (brother of U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall), politician James Mercer Garnett, military officer Walker Keith Armistead, academic Josiah Meigs, John Dandridge (father of Martha Washington), the likewise named paternal grandfather of Thomas Jefferson, and William Bradford, colonial governor of Massachusetts.[62]

A member of the Republican Party, Goodlatte's district represents Roanoke and also includes Lynchburg, Harrisonburg and Staunton.


Born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the son of Doris B. (ne Mentzendorff) and Robert Swan Goodlatte. His paternal ancestry includes English and Irish and his maternal grandfather was a Baltic German from Riga.[1] Goodlatte received a B.A. in political science from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine in 1974. He also holds a Juris Doctor from Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Virginia, received in 1977.[2]
In his early professional career he served as a staff aide for 6th District U.S. Congressman M. Caldwell Butler from 1977 to 1979. Goodlatte went on to work as a lawyer in private practice from 1980 to 1993.[2]
Bob Goodlatte received the Republican nomination at the Republican District convention after Democratic Party candidate Jim Olin opted not to run for reelection in 1992. In the 1992 November general election, Goodlatte defeated Democratic candidate Stephen Musselwhite, who had defeated Olin's preferred choice at the district Democratic convention, with 60% of the vote. Goodlatte has been reelected ten times, often running unopposed. His most substantive opposition was in 1996, with Democratic candidate Jeff Grey, and again in 1998, with Democratic Roanoke mayor David Bowers who challenged him. In an overwhelmingly conservative district, Goodlatte turned back these challenges, with 67% and 69% of the vote, respectively. In 2008, he was challenged by Democratic candidate Sam Rasoul of Roanoke. Goodlatte garnered 62% of the vote. In 2010, Goodlatte was challenged by Independent Jeffrey Vanke and Libertarian Stuart Bain. Goodlatte won with 76.26% of the vote.[3]
In 2011, Republican Karen Kwiatkowski of Mount Jackson, Virginia, announced that she would challenge Goodlatte in the Republican primary set for June 12, 2012. This was Bob Goodlatte's first contested Republican primary. Kwiatkowski earned 34% of the Republican primary vote, with Goodlatte winning 66%.[4] He faced Democratic nominee Andy Schmookler in the general election and defeated him with 66% of the vote.[5]
As House Judiciary Chairman for the 113th congress, Goodlatte has contrasted the House approach to immigration reform from the Senate by requiring that the various issues be taken on a piece-by-piece basis with an emphasis on both border and interior enforcement measures. So far the House Judiciary Committee has passed four immigration related bills:[6]
One of Representative Goodlatte's top legislative initiatives was his Constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the ""clean"" Balanced Budget Amendment which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes.[10][11] However, Representatives Paul Ryan, Justin Amash, David Dreier and Louie Gohmert voted against the ""clean"" amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Representative Ryan released a statement after the vote: ""Im concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment.
Bob Goodlatte voted to increase the U.S. debt ceiling seven times and has voted to pass budgets from Democratic as well as Republican administrations. He voted for Bill Clinton's Budget Act in July, 1997 and Barack Obama's Budget Act of 2011.[12][13]
Before his appointment as Ranking Republican of the House Agriculture Committee at the start of the 110th Congress, Goodlatte served as Chairman of the full Committee. He was elected to serve as Chairman of the full House Agriculture Committee in January 2003 at the start of the 108th Congress. He served as Chairman of the Committee throughout the 108th and 109th Congresses, convening 132 Full and Subcommittee hearings and guiding 38 bills under the Committees jurisdiction to the Presidents desk to be signed into law. He has served on the House Agriculture Committee since first being elected to Congress in November 1992. Before becoming Chairman of the full Committee, Goodlatte served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Department, Operations, Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry. An active subcommittee chairman, he held fourteen hearings in the 107th Congress alone. The hearings covered a wide range of issues including implementation of the national fire plan, domestic nutrition programs, invasive species, and civil rights programs at the USDA. He served as a conferee on the 2002 Farm Bill.
Goodlatte took a leadership role on issues such as welfare reform and forestry policy, working with his colleagues on the Agriculture and Resources Committees to introduce George W. Bushs Healthy Forests Initiative.
Goodlatte is the co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Internet Caucus, Chairman of the House Republican High-Technology Working Group, and Co-Chairman of the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus.
Goodlatte has been a leader in Congress on a number of Internet and high-tech issues including encryption, piracy prevention, anti-counterfeiting, online service provider copyright liability, high speed data access, privacy, digital signatures, Internet tax moratorium, copyright term extension, H-1B visas, patent reform, cyber-squatting, Y2K litigation, class action reform, spam and spyware prevention and providing local television networks to rural areas on satellite systems.
Goodlatte is an original sponsor of the Stop Online Piracy Act, H.R. 3261, introduced in the House's, Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet Subcommittee, which he Chairs. He is also a coauthor of the bill, as referenced by Chairman Lamar Smith,[14] Congresswoman Waters,[15] and Goodlatte himself[16] during Markup hearings for SOPA.
SOPA's critics charge that copyright owners are able to seek immediate recourse for copyrights violations through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as well as Title 17 of the United States Code. Technology engineers, website owners and venture capitalists charge that the bill will hurt Internet architecture, decrease tech industry job growth and unnecessarily burden and increase the costs of doing business for domestic website owners and operators. Free Speech advocates and conservatives charge that the bill centralizes authority at the executive branch, which might use it to prevent search engines and Internet Services Providers from delivering dissenting websites to customers; violates the First Amendment; establishes Internet firewalls; and hinders online users from sharing information.[17]
Goodlatte is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online gambling. In 2006, he sponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[18] In September 2006, working with then Iowa Congressman Jim Leach, Goodlatte was a major House supporter of the Unlawful Internet gambliing Enforcement Act of 2006. The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the 2006 elections. Prior to it being added to the bill, the gambling provisions had not been debated by any Congressional committee.[19] The bill was made sure to exclude online gambling. They claimed moral reasons for pushing for a ban on Internet gambling, but critics charge that it was due to campaign contributions from Microsoft and Steam .[20]
Goodlatte sat on the 105th United States Congress and introduced NET Act on July 25, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright infringement.[21] NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.[22]
On October 23, 2013, Goodlatte introduced the Innovation Act, a bill aimed at reducing frivolous patent infringement lawsuits by patent trolls.[23] The bill passed in the House on December 5, 2013.
On September 12, 2013, Goodlatte introduced the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (H.R. 3086; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to make permanent the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.[24] Goodlatte wrote an op-ed in The Hill arguing strongly in favor of the bill. Goodlatte said that in ""our new digital economy"" a ""computer and internet access serve as a gateway - if not a necessity - for the American Dream. Millions of Americans now rely on the internet to run their businesses, to educate themselves, to seek new opportunities, to research and write, and to communicate with family and friends.""[25] According to Goodlatte, the bill was necessary to protect the American people and their ability to access the internet from the high monetary barriers that would be created if states were allowed to tax internet access.[25]
On March 27, 2014, Goodlatte introduced the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4323; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would amend the Debbie Smith Act of 2004 in order to reauthorize funding through Fiscal Year 2019 for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, sexual assault forensic exam program grants, and DNA training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel, and court officers.[26] The bill would authorize the appropriation of $968 million over the 2015-2019 period.[27] The grant program would go to the states to run programs to analyze DNA samples from crime victims.[28] Goodlatte said that he was ""pleased that the House voted today to stand by these brave victims and ensure that DNA analysis is completed quickly so that law enforcement officials can accurately identify, prosecute, and lock these criminals in jail so that sexual predators are not left free to roam our streets and potentially hurt more women.""[29] He also urged the Senate to move quickly to pass the legislation.

Prior to his election to Congress, Brat was a professor at RandolphMacon College. Rep. Brat, who is a Republican, is a member of the following House Committees: Budget, Education and Workforce, and Small Business.
Brat defeated Democratic nominee Jack Trammell and Libertarian nominee James Carr on November 4, 2014.
Brat earlier defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the district's 2014 Republican primary on June 10, 2014.[1] Brat's primary victory over Cantor made him the first primary challenger to oust a sitting House Majority Leader since the position's creation in 1899, and is considered one of the biggest upsets in congressional history.[2]


Brat was born in Detroit[3] on July 27, 1964.[4][5] Brat's father, Paul, was a doctor of internal medicine; his mother, Nancy, was employed as a social worker in Alma, Michigan, where he was raised.[6][6][7][8] His family moved from Alma to Minnesota when David, the oldest of three boys, was in junior high.[6] Brat graduated from Park Center Senior High School in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.[6]
Brat attended Hope College in Michigan and received a B.A. in Business Administration in 1986; he also graduated with a Master's degree in Divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1990 and earned a Ph.D in economics from American University in 1995.[9]
After working for Arthur Andersen and as a consultant for the World Bank, Brat joined the faculty of RandolphMacon College in 1996,[9] where he served as chair of the department of economics, and taught courses including ""Britain in the International Economy"", ""International Economic Development"", and ""Business Ethics"".[10]
From 2010 to 2012 Brat headed Randolph-Macon's BB&T Moral Foundations of Capitalism program, one of sixty similar programs and chairs in the philosophy and economics departments at United States universities devoted to the study of capitalism and morality, endowed by the BB&T Corporation.[11][12][13][14]
In 2006 Brat was appointed by Virginia governor Tim Kaine to the Governor's Advisory Board of Economists, a position he continues to hold. He has also served on the board of directors of the Richmond Metropolitan Authority, and on the advisory board of the Virginia Public Access Project.[14]
From 2005 to 2011, Brat worked as a special legislative assistant to Virginia state senator Walter Stosch in the area of higher education.[9] In 2006 he was appointed by Democratic governor Tim Kaine to serve on a bipartisan economic advisory council. He was later reappointed by Republican Governor Bob McDonnell.[15]
In August 2011, Brat announced he was running for the Virginia House of Delegates seat for the 56th district. There was no primary, and six Republican leaders met and chose Peter Farrell, as the Republican nominee in the November 2011 general election.[16]
Brat ran against House Majority Leader Eric Cantor for the Republican nomination for Virginia's 7th congressional district and defeated Cantor by a 12-point margin.[17] Brat was outspent by Cantor 40 to 1: Cantor spent over $5 million, while Brat raised $200,000 and did not spend all of it.[18][19] Brat's primary campaign was managed by 23-year-old Zachary Werrell.[20] An analysis of campaign filings conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics concluded that Brat did not receive any donations from political action committees and ultimately conceded, ""it's almost impossible to profile Brat's typical donor, because he had so few.""[21] Brat's win was a historic and stunning victory,[22][23][24] as it was the first time a sitting House Majority Leader was defeated in his primary race since the position was created in 1899.[25]
Compared with Cantor, described as aloof, Brat was characterized as knowing how to work a crowd.[26] He ran an anti-establishment campaign criticizing government bailouts and budget deals while frequently invoking God and the Constitution in his speeches. During the campaign, Cantor criticized Brat as a ""liberal professor"" who had strong ties to Tim Kaine, Virginia's former Democratic governor and current junior Senator.[27]
Brat ran well to Cantor's right, complaining that Cantor had a ""crony-capitalist mentality"", putting the interests of the corporate sector ahead of small businesses.[28] His campaign laid particular stress on opposing immigration reform, saying that Cantor favored ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.[29] Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham endorsed Brat's candidacy and hosted a rally with him in a Richmond suburb.[1] Brat was also supported by radio talk show host Mark Levin[30] and Ann Coulter.[31] Chris Peace, a state legislator who collaborated with Brat on state budget issues at Randolph-Macon College, stated that Brat was inspired to run for Congress because of ""His passion for the structure of government and belief in free markets.""[32]
Brat's victory was described in the press as exposing a ""deep schism"" in the Republican party between its conservative base and its business wing, as well as a split between establishment Republicans and tea party insurgents.[33][34][35][36]
Brat received support from, and gave credit for his win to local Tea Party groups in Virginia, but received no funding or endorsement from national Tea Party organizations.[22] Brat has not self-identified with the Tea Party movement.[37] Ron Rapoport, a political scientist at the College of William & Mary, has said Brat may be correctly identified as a ""tea partier"" only if the term is used as a catchall for ""anti-establishment activist"", while John Judis has opined that Brat could more correctly be described as a ""right-wing populist"".[38] Matea Gold in The Washington Post stated, ""the fact that Brat took off without the help of those organizations [national tea party groups] now makes it harder for them to claim his victory as their own.""[39]
During an interview with Sean Hannity on the night of his win, Brat said:
And I was blessed. I mean, it's a miracle. What do I attribute it to? First of all, I attribute it to God. And I'm utterly humbled and thankful. I'm a believer and so I'm humbled that God gave us this win. But right with that, God acts through people, and God acted through the people on my behalf.[40][41]
Brat faced Democratic nominee Jack Trammell, who is also a professor at Randolph-Macon, and James Carr, the Libertarian candidate, in the November general election.[42] Brat was favored due to the 7th's significant Republican lean.[43] The district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+10, easily the most Republican district in eastern Virginia.
According to an article in The Boston Globe, Cantor announced plans to aid Brat by resigning from the United States Congress on August 18, so that a special election could be held on the same day as the general election. Thus the winner, in a race in which Brat is favored, would take office with the perks of seniority over other first time Republicans elected in the 2014 midterm elections and with the ability to participate in the lame duck session of Congress.[44]
Brat defeated Trammell with 60.83% of the vote compared to Trammell's 36.95%.[45] Libertarian candidate James Carr finished in third with 2.09% of the vote.
Dave Brat was sworn in on November 12, 2014 to finish Eric Cantor's term.[46]
On January 6, 2015, Brat was one of twenty-five House Republicans to vote against John Boehner's re-election as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was re-elected with 216 votes.[47] Though Brat supported Boehner earlier, he reversed his support after the House GOP leadership did not allow him to make an amendment to block a controversial executive order signed by President Barack Obama in a spending bill.[48]
To Brat, culture matters in economic markets. He believes that the culture that produced Adam Smith was a Protestant culture and that fact and the ethics of that culture are important in understanding market efficiency.[49][50] In his 2011 essay titled God and Advanced Mammon  Can Theological Types Handle Usury and Capitalism?, Brat posits that if Christian people ""had the guts to spread the word"", government would not need to ""backstop every action we take"".[51] According to Kevin Roose in a New York Magazine article, Brat ""sees free-market economics as being intricately linked to ethics and faith and he makes the case that Adam Smith's invisible hand theory, should be seen in the context of Christianity"".[52] Furthering the central theme of Max Weber's seminal book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Brat argues in his 2004 paper Economic Growth and Institutions: The Rise and Fall of the Protestant Ethic? that ""institutions such as religion, democracy and government anti-diversion policies all significantly enhance a country's long-run economic performance,"" and concludes that ""the religion variable may be the strongest ex ante, exogenous institutional variable in the literature.""[53] In a paper titled Is Growth Exogenous? Taking Bernanke Seriously, Brat debates former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, asserting that Bernanke's work on economic growth overlooks religious institutions  in particular Protestant  in a country's economic growth, and that while savings rates, population growth and human capital accumulation help drive economic growth, the larger factor is ""the Protestant religious establishment"", which Bernanke ignores.[54]
Brat has advocated that Christians, both individually and through the church, should more forcefully support free-market capitalism, and should behave more altruistically, in the manner of Jesus, so that ""we would not need the government to backstop every action we take.""[55] He has blamed the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany on the lack of ""unified resistance"", adding, ""I have the sinking feeling that it could all happen again, quite easily.""[51][55] Brat believes that countries with Protestant pasts have economic advantages over countries that do not, and that Protestantism ""provides an efficient set of property rights and encourages a modern set of economic incentives"" that often lead to ""positive economic performance"".[52] He believes in Christ as a transformer of culture, and that capitalism is the key to world transformation, which can be achieved when capitalism and Christianity merge; if people follow the gospel, and as a consequence behave more morally, he argues, then the markets will improve.[56]
Zack Beauchamp from Vox Media has said that Brat believes that ""most economists are motivated by philosophy rather than science: they're secretly utilitarians who believe that the goal of public policy is to produce the greatest good for the greatest number.""[57]
Although Brat has stated he does not identify as a Randian, he has acknowledged having been influenced by Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged and has expressed appreciation of Ayn Rand's case for human freedom and free markets.[58]
Brat has promised to vote against raising the debt ceiling for the first five years he is in Congress,[59] and attacked Cantor during the primary campaign for voting to end the federal government shutdown of 2013.[59]
Brat opposes federally driven education policies such as the Common Core curriculum, and No Child Left Behind.[60]
His decision to enter the Republican primary was driven largely by Cantor's role in weakening congressional ethics reform. Brat stated: ""If you want to find out the smoking gun in this campaign, just go Google and type the STOCK Act and CNN and Eric Cantor.""[61]
Brat has stated he will ""fight to defund and repeal Obamacare"",[62] and wants to ""replace it with free-market solutions that lower costs, improve quality, and increase access to care"".[63]
Brat has called for the National Security Agency to end bulk collection of phone records and has stated his support for statutory protections for e-mail privacy. He has argued that domestic intelligence activities have ""spun out of control"",[64] and ""the NSA's indiscriminate collection of data on all Americans is a disturbing violation of our Fourth Amendment right to privacy.""[65]
In 2011, Brat criticized the political Right for simultaneously advancing the pursuit of individual liberty while pushing laws restricting abortion, homosexuality and gambling, and the Left for simultaneously supporting progressive liberal individualism while coercing others to ""fund every social program under the sun"".[51]
His website states that Brat will ""protect the rights of the unborn and the sanctity of marriage, and will oppose any governmental intrusion upon the conscience of people of faith"".[66]
Brat has criticized both political parties for not addressing Medicare and Social Security, stating, ""neither side of the aisle will talk about the most important issues because that is going to involve pain.""[67] Brat advocates ""market-based reforms"" to these programs,[68] as in his view, it is unfair that people pay less than they take out so these programs have to be slashed or eliminated.[69] He advocates for private Social Security accounts.[70]
Brat advocates for an end to tax credits, deductions and loopholes, and calls for a flatter and more efficient tax code.[71]
Brat is a proponent of term limits for members of Congress. He has pledged, if elected, to serve a maximum of 12 years (six terms) in Congress.[63]
Brat has indicated he opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008 and has stated that, if elected, he would ""vote against bills that benefit big business over small business"".[63] He has stated: ""I'm not against business. I'm against big business in bed with big government.""[61]
Brat was raised in the Presbyterian faith and his wife is a Roman Catholic.[6] Splitting their time between two churches,[6] they are parishioners of St. Mary Catholic Church in Richmond.[76] Brat also identifies as a Calvinist and lists affiliations with Christ Episcopal Church, Third Presbyterian, and Shady Grove Methodist.[56]
Brat moved to Virginia in 1996 with his wife, Laura.[77] They live in Glen Allen, a suburb of Richmond.[78] They have two children, Jonathan and Sophia.[79]
Brat's brother, Dan, is a medical doctor specializing in neuropathology. He also serves as vice-chairman of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Emory University. His youngest brother, Jim, is a Los Angeles-based real estate attorney.[6][80]"

In 1968 he graduated from Gonzaga College High School, where he was salutatorian of his class; in 1972 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College, magna cum laude, in economics. Beyer was a Presidential Scholar in 1968, and was a National Merit Scholarship winner. He graduated from a winter Outward Bound course at Dartmouth College in January 1971, and attended Wellesley College that year as part of the ""12 College Exchange"" program.[5]
Beyer was elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 1989, beating Republican state senator Edwina P. Dalton. He was re-elected in 1993, beating Republican Michael Farris 54-46 percent, as Republicans George Allen and Jim Gilmore were elected on the same ballot as Governor and Attorney General, respectively. Farris's close connection to conservative leaders such as Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority, Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition and Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, as well as his adherence to the Quiverfull movement[6][7] stirred deep-seated feelings about religion and politics. Some argued that these concerns, inflamed by negative ads by Beyer, caused alienation of enough moderate voters to cause Farris to lose the election.[8] Prominent Virginia Republicans such as U.S. Senator John Warner supported Beyer rather than Farris.
During his tenure as Lieutenant Governor, Beyer served as president of the Virginia Senate. He chaired the Virginia Economic Recovery Commission, the Virginia Commission on Sexual Assault, the Virginia Commission on Disabilities, the Poverty Commission and was co-founder of the Northern Virginia Technology Council, an outgrowth of the Chamber of Commerce.[9] He was active in promoting high-tech industries, and lead the fight to eliminate disincentives in the Virginia Tax Code to high-tech research and development.[10]
He is also credited with writing the original welfare reform legislation in Virginia.[11]
Beyer was the Democratic nominee for governor in 1997, losing in the general election to Republican Jim Gilmore. He served as Finance Chairman for Mark Warner's Political Action Committee, ""Forward Together""[12] and as the National Treasurer for the 2004 presidential campaign of former Vermont Governor Howard Dean.[13] Following Dean's withdrawal from that race, he served as chairman of the Kerry/Edwards presidential campaign in Virginia.[14]
During 200708, he endorsed and campaigned extensively for presidential candidate Barack Obama,.[15] He served as chairman of the Mid Atlantic Finance Council of Obama for America campaign,[16] and served on the campaign's National Finance Council.
He was appointed by the Democratic National Committee to serve at the 2008 DNC Convention on the Credentials Committee.[17]
Following the 2008 election, President-elect Obama asked Beyer to head up the transition team at the Commerce Department.[18]
Obama nominated Beyer for the post of United States Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein on June 12, 2009.[19] In December 2010 Beyer attracted public attention when it was reported that he had warned the Swiss government against offering asylum to Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange.[20]
On January 24, 2014, Beyer announced that he was running for Virginia's 8th congressional district in the 2014 elections to succeed retiring Democratic incumbent Jim Moran.[21] It was his first partisan race since losing the 1997 gubernatorial election. He won the June 10 Democratic primary with 45.7 percent of the vote.[22]
Beyer faced and defeated Republican nominee Micah Edmond in the general election. For all intents and purposes, however, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress in the primary. The 8th is the second-most Democratic district in Virginia, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+16 (only the 3rd District is more Democratic).
Beyer and his younger brother, Michael, are the owners of nine Volvo, Land Rover, Kia, Volkswagen and Subaru car dealerships in Northern Virginia. He is a past chair of the National Volvo Retailer Advisory Board.
In 2006, he served as chairman of the American International Automobile Dealers Association.[23]
Beyer served as a member of the board of Demosphere International, Inc., a leading soccer registration software provider.[24] He was also a board member of History Associates, which bills itself as ""The Best Company in History.""[25] He has served on the Virginia Board of First Union National Bank, the board of Shenandoah Life Insurance Company, and the board of Lightly Expressed, a fiber optic lighting design and manufacturing firm.
During nearly three decades of community activism, he has taken leadership roles on the boards of many business, philanthropic and public policy organizations, including the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board, the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce and the American Cancer Society. He has received numerous awards and honors, including the Grand Award for Highway Safety from the National Safety Federation; the James C. Wheat, Jr. Award for Service to Virginians with Disabilities;[26] the Earl Williams Leadership in Technology Award; and the Thomas Jefferson Award for 2012 from American Citizens Abroad.[27]
He chaired the board of the Alexandria Community Trust, Alexandria's community foundation,[28] and the board of Jobs for Virginia Graduates, the state's largest high school dropout prevention program.[29] He is past president of the board of Youth for Tomorrow, Washington Redskins' coach Joe Gibbs' residential home for troubled adolescent boys and girls.[30] He also served on the board of the DC Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.[31]
Beyer and his wife, Megan, have two children, Clara and Grace. In addition, he has two children, Don and Stephanie, from a previous marriage,[32] and two grandchildren, Ava Anne and William Sternoff Kirby.[33]"

Washington and Lee University","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Griffith","Morgan Griffith","Republican","Virginia House of Delegates","Episcopalian","Howard Morgan Griffith (born March 15, 1958) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for Virginia's 9th congressional district since 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district takes in a large swath of southwestern Virginia, including the New River Valley.
He was the majority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates and represented the 8th District, serving from 1994 until 2011. The district included all of Salem, Virginia and parts of Roanoke County.[3]


Griffith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but his family moved to Salem, Virginia while he was a baby. He attended Andrew Lewis High School, graduating in 1976. He attended Emory and Henry College, graduating in 1980. Griffith completed his education with a J.D. from the Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1983.
After law school, Griffith settled in Salem where he worked as a private attorney with a focus on traffic violations and DUI. On June 23, 2008, Albo & Oblon LLP, a law firm run by fellow Republican delegate Dave Albo, announced that Griffith was joining the firm as head of its new Roanoke/Salem office.[4]
Griffith first became seriously involved in politics in 1986, when he was chosen as the chairman of the Salem Republican Party. He held that position from 1986 to 1988 and from 1991 to 1994.
In 1993, Griffith was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, defeating Democrat Howard C. Packett. He served as the Vice-Chairman of the Rules Committee in the House of Delegates. He served on the Courts of Justice Committee, and was the chairman of its Criminal Law Subcommittee. He also served on the Commerce and Labor and the Militia, Police, and Public Safety Committees.[citation needed] He was elected House Majority Leader in 2000 and was the first Republican to hold that position in Virginia's history.[5]
Griffith was the Republican nominee to face longtime U.S. Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA) who was first elected in 1982. A ""GOP Young Gun"", Griffith won the election.[6] Griffith's home in Salem was located just inside the neighboring 6th District, represented by fellow Republican Bob Goodlatte. The bulk of his House of Delegates district, however, was located in the 9th.
Griffith defeated Democratic nominee Anthony Flaccavento 61.3 percent to 38.6 percent.[7]
Griffith has voted to allow the Commonwealth of Virginia to enforce federal immigration laws to criminalize knowingly employing illegal immigrants or undocumented workers,[9] and also voted to criminalize possession of firearms by illegal aliens.[10]
While serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, Griffith supported a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage by defining marriage as between one man and one woman.[11] He voted in favor of a motion to effectively kill a bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for government employees in Virginia.[12]
Griffith voted in favor of several bills to reduce restrictions on gun ownership, including a bill to allow concealed weapons in vehicles without a permit[13] and to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry their firearms in restaurants and bars.[14] Griffith also voted to prohibit consumption of alcohol while in possession of a concealed weapon.[15] In 2004 Griffith voted to prohibit carrying firearms or ammunition in the non-secure areas of airport terminals, including baggage claim areas.[16][17]
Early in 2010, Griffith voted in favor of a bill to prohibit any individual mandate to purchase health insurance.[18] This law passed Virginia's legislature before the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted, which Virginia has used to challenge the individual mandate in federal court.[19] However on July 17, 2013 Griffith was the lone GOP member of the House to vote against delaying the implementation of the individual mandate.[20]
Just prior to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Griffith issued press release in which he endorsed the final House version of Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which would have continued funding for federal government operations while delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act.[21] Griffith voted against the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, the Senate-proposed compromise that ended the shutdown without defunding the Affordable Care Act.[22]
Griffith has voted consistently for expansions of the death penalty to include eligibility for accomplices to a murder, as well as for those who murder a judge or a witness.[23][24][25]
When surveyed in 1999 on his political positions by Project Vote Smart, Griffith indicated that he supports legalized abortion in the first trimester and to save the life of the mother,[26] while favoring the restriction of abortion through parental notification laws and prohibition of partial-birth abortion. Griffith's voting record has generally been consistent with his 1999 survey, voting in favor of restrictions on late term abortions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, while voting against bills that would restrict first-term abortions. In 2010 Griffith voted to restrict state funding of abortions,[27] and to require abortion clinics to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for fetal stem cell research.[28]
In 2007 Griffith voted against [29] a bill in the Virginia General Assembly, HB 2797, which stated: ""That life begins at the moment of fertilization and the right to enjoyment of life guaranteed by Article 1,  1 of the Constitution of Virginia is vested in each born and preborn human being from the moment of fertilization""[30] This was the only bill introduced to the General Assembly during Griffith's tenure that would have affected the legality of first-term abortions on the principal of the fetal personhood as opposed to regulating abortion on other grounds.[citation needed]
Griffith's 2010 campaign website reported that Griffith has a ""100% pro-life"" voting record and an ""A"" rating from the Virginia Society for Human Life (VSHL). However, VSHL's report on 2007 legislation in Virginia omits reference to HB 2797[31] Project Vote Smart indicated that Griffith declined to take their survey again in 2010.[26]
Griffith supports raising the retirement age and reducing the number of American troops serving overseas as means of reducing the federal budget deficit.[32]
In 2014, Griffith introduced legislation to move marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II narcotic, which would effectively make the drug legal for medical purposes under federal law.[33]
Griffith is married to the former Hilary Davis. The couple has three children."

Georgetown University Law Center","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Comstock","Barbara Comstock","Republican","Virginia House of Delegates","Roman Catholic","Barbara Jean Comstock (born June 30, 1959) is an American politician, currently a Republican member of the U.S. Congress from Virginia's 10th District. From 2010 to 2014, she was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. She first won election to her seat in 2009, defeating Democratic incumbent Margaret Vanderhye.[5][6] She has worked at numerous positions for various government agencies, including chief counsel of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, director of public affairs at the Department of Justice, and as a staffer for Congressman Frank Wolf. She is a founding partner and co-principal of public policy and public relations firm Corallo Comstock.[7][8]
On January 7, 2014, Comstock announced her candidacy for U.S. Congress from Virginia's 10th District. She won that election and took office in January 2015.


Comstock began her congressional career as an intern for Senator Ted Kennedy. After working as a lawyer in private practice, Comstock served from 1991-1995 as a senior aide to Congressman Frank Wolf. Comstock then served as chief investigative counsel and senior counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform from 1995 to 1999.[9]
Comstock worked on behalf of the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. Her research team built massive stores of paper and electronic data, known as ""The Gore File,"" that were a key source of information on the former vice president for GOP publicists and ad-makers.[9] Comstock is credited with writing the Republican ""playbook"" defending Bush nominees such as John Ashcroft for U.S. Attorney General.[9] Comstock later served as director of public affairs for the Justice Department from 2002 to 2003.[10] She has been praised for her work in opposition research for the Republican National Committee.[9][11]
Comstock joined lobbyist firm Blank Rome LLP in 2004. [12][13][14]
Comstock assisted the defense teams of both I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby[7] and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.[15] In 2005, Comstock was hired by Dan Glickman to lobby on behalf of the Motion Picture Association of America.[16]
Comstock was a consultant on the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney and is also a consultant to the Workforce Fairness Institute, which opposes the Employee Free Choice Act.[17] Comstock was paid from 2008 through 2012 by WFI, according to her campaign, but she made at least two more media appearances on behalf of the group in 2013 While serving as Delegate. She initially failed to list WFI as a client when she filed papers to run for the seat. Her campaign later disclosed the relationship to The Washington Post,[18] calling the omission unintentional. Congressional candidates with an ownership interest in companies are required to report clients who paid $5,000 or more in fees. While receiving payments, Comstock sponsored legislation that benefited the WFI and their primary objectives.[19] She also serves as Co-Chair of the Executive Committee of the Susan B. Anthony List.[20]
In 2011, Comstock voted in favor of HB 462, which required women to have ultrasounds before receiving an abortion. When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only.[21] She also voted in favor of the amendment.[22] Comstock supports exceptions to bans on abortions in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.[21] She also supports making birth control available to women over the counter.[22]
On January 7, 2014 she announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 10th District, following the announcement that Rep. Frank Wolf will retire at the end of the 113th Congress rather than run for reelection.
The Daily Caller reported that an opposition research packet on Comstock suggests she ""will likely come under fire in Virginias 10th congressional district race over the question of whether she is conservative enough.""[23]
On April 26, 2014, Barbara Comstock won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 10th District firehouse primary, defeating five other candidates and winning approximately 54% of the total vote.
While debating John Foust at Virginia's 10th Congressional District Debate, Comstock answered a question about how congress should handle comprehensive immigration reform. She said, Fed-Ex can track packages coming in here all of the time, we can track people who are coming into the country and we can do that right. She then went on to oppose passing comprehensive immigration reform preferring a piecemeal approach instead.[24][25]
Comstock in tandem with Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie planned on attending a public meeting Northern Shenandoah Valley Tea Party in early August. After rumors arose that questions would be taken from the crowd at this public event, both candidates moved the meeting to a private location. After criticism from Democratic candidates about why they needed to hide behind closed doors to meet with their base of voters, Comstock and Gillespie opted to chat with the group by phone instead. This decision prompted a statement from David Sparkman, chairman of the Tea Party group, to say, ""I'm disappointed, I wanted to look these politicians in the eye and take their measure.""[26]
Comstock has received the endorsements of the United States Chamber of Commerce,[27] the National Federation of Independent Business,[28] and both the Virginia Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors.[29] On August 28, 2014, Comstock received the endorsement of the Virginia Police Benevolent Association (VAPBA). In 2012 the VAPBA had endorsed the Democratic challenger to Rep. Frank Wolf in the same district.[30]
Comstock won the election on November 4, 2014, defeating Democrat John Foust with 57 percent of the vote.[31]"

Connolly graduated from Maryknoll College in Illinois with a B.A. in Literature in 1971, and completed a Master of Public Administration from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 1979.
Connolly worked from 1979 through 1989 with the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where he managed committee oversight of international economic issues, international narcotics control, and United Nations and Middle East policies, and published reports on U.S. policy in El Salvador, Central America, Israel and the Persian Gulf region.[1] From 1989 through 1997 he was Vice President of the Washington Office of SRI International. He was also Director of Community Relations for SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation).[2]
In local politics, Gerry served on the Fairfax Government Reorganization Commission from 1992 through 1993. In 1995 he was elected Providence District Supervisor, serving for nine years.
Connolly's career as a public official began on March 28, 1995 when he was elected Providence District Supervisor on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. He was reelected to a four-year term on the board in November of that same year. Connolly ran unopposed for re-election in November 1999. In 2003, he was elected Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and was reelected in 2007.
As Chairman of the ten-member board, Connolly balanced a $4.5 billion budget and managed a county that, based on size, would make it the nation's thirteenth largest city, twelfth largest school district, and sixth largest office market. He served as Chairman of the County's Legislative Committee and Vice-Chair of the Economic Advisory Committee. Connolly also served as Chairman of the Board of the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC), Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC), and was chairman of the Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG). He also chaired the region's Emergency Preparedness Taskforce and represented Fairfax County on the Board of the Virginia Association of Counties (VaCo), where he also served as president.
Connolly is Pro-Choice.[11] He voted against the Stupak Amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which placed stringent limits on health insurance companies offering abortion services. During the budget amendments process in 2011, he voted against an amendment that would have prevented taxpayer funds from going to Planned Parenthood.[12]
Connolly has voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 regarding funding the US Armed Forces, including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also includes a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone ""who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners"", and anyone who commits a ""belligerent act"" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, ""without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force."" The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of unlawful combatants until hostilities are over is in accordance to the Geneva Conventions.[13][14]
Connolly has voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,[15] the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009,[16] the supplemental appropriations bill that established Cash for Clunkers,[16] and the Cash for Clunkers Extension.[17] Additionally, he voted for all of the 2010 governmental appropriations bills,[18][19][20][21][22][23] and he voted for the Continuing Appropriations Act for 2011.[24] However, he has voted against some large spending bills, including opposing the release of $350billion in bank bailout funds[25] and a $154billion spending bill[26] because of concerns these would add to the federal deficit.[27]
He was a cosponsor of pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budget legislation that was signed into law in February 2010.[28]
In May, 2011, Connolly voted to increase the debt ceiling, but the measure failed by a significant margin.[29] It was his third such vote.[30]
Connolly voted in favor of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,[31] saying it would strengthen national security while spurring innovation in the energy industry.[32] In 2010, he voted in favor of ending a moratorium on deepwater drilling rigs that met certain safety standards.[33] Connolly is one of the 35 congressmen who founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition.[34]
Connolly supports gay rights, having campaigned against the Marshall-Newman Amendment to the Virginia Constitution, which banned all gay unions from being performed or recognized in Virginia.[35] In Congress, he voted in favor of repealing the contentious ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" law that prohibited gays from serving openly in the military, and has co-sponsored a few bills that would repeal portions of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.[36] In June 2013, Connolly posed for a picture with the NO H8 Campaign.
While on the Board of Supervisors for Fairfax County, Connolly sponsored an ordinance that would have made it illegal to transport a loaded shotgun in the back of one's car.[37] In Congress, Connolly signed onto a measure that would have closed the gun show loophole by requiring that private sellers of firearms at gun shows engage in the same background check and reporting requirements as registered firearms dealers.[38] Connolly opposes allowing concealed weapons in schools and on college campuses.[39]
In November, 2011, Connolly voted against the National Right to Carry Reciprocity Act, which would have exempted non-residents of states that prohibit concealed weapons from those restrictions.[40]
In 2009, Connolly was an early supporter of the Democratic health care plan, which ultimately became the America's Affordable Health Choices Act, as well as the public health insurance option; saying at a live chat with constituents in September to a woman from Washington, D.C. that ""One of my principles for health care reform is that it increases the choices you have. By setting up a health insurance exchange, we can give your family more insurance choices, hopefully including one that your daughter's doctor chooses to accept"". Connolly voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment,[41] and later for the America's Affordable Health Choices Act in March 2010.
Connolly cited deficit reduction in explaining his health care vote.[42][43]
Connolly was a cosponsor of the Helping Active Duty Deployed Act[44] and the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act.[45]
Connolly was a supporter of a Military intervention in Syria.[46]
Connolly scored a 24 point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman Leslie L. Byrne in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated Republican nominee Keith Fimian by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent Tom Davis.[47] The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010. Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.[48]
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote. Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting. The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area. However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor. Barack Obama carried the old 11th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61 percent of the vote under the new linesmaking it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.
Gerry Connolly is facing Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid.[49]
Connolly and his wife Cathy have lived in Mantua since 1979. Their daughter is a student at a Virginia university. He serves on the Boards of Directors for Fairfax Partnership for Youth, the American Red Cross of the National Capital Area, the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Washington Initiative Board of Trustees, the Medical Care for Children Partnership, the Institute for Regional Excellence, and the University of Virginia  Virginia Institute of Government. He previously served as president of the Mantua Citizens Association (MCA) president and two terms as president of the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations.
Connolly is also a company member of The Providence Players of Fairfax, a community theatre in Fairfax County, having acted in several of their shows.[50]
In 2004, Connolly was charged with a hit and run after an incident in Tysons Corner, but was found not guilty by a county judge.[51]"

University of Washington","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzan_DelBene","Suzan DelBene","Democratic","Washington Department of Revenue Director","Episcopalian","Suzan Kay DelBene (born February 17, 1962) is an American politician who has been the United States Representative for Washington's 1st congressional district since 2012.
DelBene was the 2010 Democratic nominee for U.S. Representative for Washington's 8th congressional district, but was defeated by incumbent Republican Dave Reichert.[3] The 2012 general election race in Washington's newly drawn 1st district, in which she faced Republican John Koster, was called in her favor by various media organizations soon after the polls closed.[4][5] She also won the election for the remainder of the term in the vacant 1st district under the pre-2012 boundaries, a seat left vacant by the resignation of Jay Inslee.


Suzan DelBene was born in Selma, Alabama. She was the fifth child in her family. She has lived in Washington for most of her life. At a young age her family moved to Newport Hills, now Newcastle, WA. They later moved to Mercer Island. In a biographical video, DelBene described her family's trouble ""paying bills"" and the hardship they faced after her father, a long time airline pilot, lost his job.
After graduating from The Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut, DelBene went to Reed College in Portland, Oregon where she earned a Bachelor's degree in biology. DelBene then continued her education at the University of Washington to earn a Master's degree in Business Administration.[6]
DelBene worked at Microsoft from 1989 to 1998 where she was director of marketing and business development for the Interactive Media Group, marketing and sales training for Microsoft's Internet properties, and other business development and product management roles with Windows 95 and early versions of the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser software. In 1998 she left to help found drugstore.com and serve as a Vice President. In 2000, she went on to be the CEO of Nimble Technology,[7] leading it through its acquisition by Actuate in 2003. In 2004, she returned to Microsoft to be Corporate Vice President of the Mobile Communications Business, until 2007.[8] From 2008 to 2009, she was a management consultant and strategic advisor to Global Partnerships, a non-profit supporting microfinance and sustainable solutions in Latin America.[9][10] Suzan DelBene was named as the director for the Washington State Department of Revenue on November 30, 2010 to replace outgoing director Cindi Holmstrom.[11]
in 2010 Suzan DelBene ran for election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat against the incumbent in the 8th Congressional District, Dave Reichert, a Republican. According to DelBene's campaign website, the economy was her top priority.[12] DelBene earned the endorsements of the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,[13][14] as well as several Democratic politicians.[15]
DelBene faced Reichert in the general election, after coming in 2nd in the primary voting. In Washington, the top two advance. DelBene lost to Reichert in the general election on November 2. She was subsequently named Washington State Revenue Director by Governor Christine Gregoire on November 30, 2010.
DelBene ran for Congress again in 2012. DelBene won the Democratic nomination for the newly drawn 1st District, previously represented by Jay Inslee, which became more competitive due to redistricting. Inslee had resigned in March to focus on his ultimately successful campaign for governor.[16] DelBene ran in two elections that day against Republican John Kostera special election for the last two months of Inslee's seventh term (and held in the boundaries of the old 1st), and a regular election for a full two-year term. She defeated Koster in both elections, winning the special election with 60 percent of the vote and the regular election with 54 percent of the vote. Her victory margin in the regular election was wider than expected, considering that the district was about six points less Democratic than its predecessor.[4][5] On November 13, 2012, she was sworn in as the district's Representative in the remainder of the 112th Congress, giving her a leg up in seniority over all but a few other congressmen first elected in 2012.[17]
Del Bene spent $2.8 million of her own money in a race in which she raised over $4 million, according to [18] in a Congressional race that became the most expensive in Washington state history.
DelBene ran for Congress again in 2014 and won against Republican Pedro Celis.[19] Delbene earned 55% of the vote to hold on to her seat.[20]
As of November 21, 2012, Suzan DelBene has a minimal legislative voting record. The following is based on her public statements, her spot in DCCCs Competitive Red-Blue Program, and Sierra Clubs endorsement of her. She has also published issue positions on her campaign website[21] and House of Representatives website.[22]
Suzan DelBene believes that the top priority within her district is job creation and strengthening the economy. She states In Congress, I will work for policies that increase research and development investments in new, emerging industries. Instead of tax breaks for companies that ship their jobs overseas, I will fight for incentives that encourage businesses to expand their domestic manufacturing footprint.[23] With regard to Washington Referendum 74, DelBene proclaimed her belief that gay marriage should be legal in Washington, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act should be repealed, because everyone has equal rights under the law.[23] When asked about Washington Initiative 502, DelBene responded that she support[s] efforts to reclassify Marijuana for medicinal use, and that she planned on voting YES for I-502.[23] Additionally, DelBene gave a statement on the Supreme Courts decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. She espouses that The Affordable Care Act upheld today is already helping millions in Washington state by allowing children to be covered on their parents plans until age 26, preventing insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions and reducing costs of prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare[24]
Delbenes earning of a spot on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)s Red-to-Blue program on August 8, 2012, is due to the fact that, as Chairman Steve Israel stated, There is strong grassroots energy behind Suzan DelBenes campaign because she knows how to create jobs. Her successful career in both the public and private sector gives her the tools and background to be a thoughtful leader who can stand up to a dysfunctional Congress and bring results for Washingtons middle class.[25]
The Sierra Club, one of the largest grassroots environmental organizations in the U.S., endorsed DelBene on July 20, 2012. This endorsement reflects DelBenes policy position on environmental and economic issues. She articulates that she will work tirelessly to ensure our nation takes meaningful steps to build a new economy based on clean and renewable energy sources and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil. DelBene relays that the 1st Congressional district will fight to promote research and innovation in the field of renewable energy. She furthermore finds it critical that Washington protect its waterways and wild lands.[26]
In addition to the Sierra Clubs endorsement, many other organizations supported DelBene, including Washington State Labor Council, National Education Association, AFT Washington, SEIU, Sheet Metal Workers, Operating Engineers, Communications Workers of America and Aerospace Machinists District 751.

He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2000 and was re-elected in each of the six subsequent elections, most recently in 2014.
Larsen is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.


Born in Arlington, Washington, he attended Pacific Lutheran University and the University of Minnesota, earning a master's degree in public affairs. He formerly worked as director of public affairs for the Washington State Dental Association and as a lobbyist for the dental profession. He also worked for the city of Everett, Washington as director of economic development for the city's port.
Before being elected to the House, Larsen gained political experience when he served as a Snohomish County Councilman and as chair of the Snohomish County Council.
On December 8, 2011, three staff members of Larsen were fired by Larsen after they were tweeting insults about Larsen and bragging about drinking on the job in Larsen's Washington office. Larsen's office fired the offending staffers within hours.[2]
In 2006, CQPolitics described him:
Larsen, a member of the centrist New Democrat Coalition in the House, has carved an image as a moderate that appeals to crucial swing voters in the politically competitive coastal district in the northwestern corner of Washington State. He still maintains support from more liberal voters, mainly in the districts population centers surrounding the port cities of Everett and Bellingham.
Given the importance of defense- and aviation-oriented jobs in the 2nd District, Larsens seats on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are politically advantageous.[3]
Rick Larsen has repeatedly cosponsored legislation that would create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in his home district[4] and is a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Larsen has authored a law that regulates the international marriage brokering industry, by protecting ""mail order brides"" from abuse and clients from being monetarily ripped off.[5] Among his other priorities are fighting for better access to health care for veterans and the poor, increasing support for government programs that combat homelessness, increasing highway funding, and finding solutions to the growing methamphetamine problem in the district. Larsen also meets regularly with the community-at-large in various events or forums and is able to help provide information if needed.
One of Rick Larsens major priorities is transportation issues. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he has voted yes on every transportation bill since being reelected in 2008.[6] He believes that sound investments in transportation keep our economy moving, and improve conditions in other areas.[7] Representative Larsen has gotten over $52 million in the form of transportation projects for the SAFETEA-LU Bill to improve highways, increase funding for ferry systems, and expedite the flow of traffic and goods through border crossings.[8]
Since being reelected in 2008, Representative Larsen has voted yes on every labor bill, ranging from the S-Miner Act to the Extending Federal Emergency Unemployment Benefits and Providing Business and Homebuyer Tax Credits bill.[6] Rick Larsen has shown strong support for the interests of the Utility Workers Union of America, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, and AFL  CIO.[9] He works to support the local Washington economy by investing in small to medium-sized businesses to help them succeed in the global economy.[7]
Pro-choice interest groups have consistently supported Rick Larsen. Planned Parenthood, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association and NARAL Pro-Choice America have all highly rated his position on abortion.[10] In addition, he has voted against several bills that would restrict abortion rights.[11]
Larsen has supported the House Democratic proposal for publicly funded health care.[12] He voted for the reform bill in November 2009.[13]
Although Larsen initially voted against a bill authorizing military force in Iraq in October 2002, he has since voted yes on nearly every bill put forth in the House concerning the Iraq and Afghanistan.[14] Larsen supports President Obama's proposed exit strategy which promises to remove combat troops by summer of 2010.[15]
Larsen defeated Republican candidate Doug Roulstone, a retired Navy officer who was recruited by GOP strategists. Larsen received 65% of the vote to Roulstone's 34%.
Larsen was challenged in the Democratic primary during his 2008 reelection campaign by perennial candidate Glen Johnson. His Republican opponent for the House race was recently retired Snohomish County Sheriff Rick Bart.
For the 2008 election cycle, Rick Larsens campaigns total income was $1,336,438.[16] His campaign spent $1,155,691.[16] The companies that contributed the most money were Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp., American Dental Assn., McBee Strategic Consulting, and Puget Energy.[16] The labor, finance/insurance/real estate, transportation, misc. business, and health sectors were the largest contributing sectors.[16] The major industry donations came from heath professionals, transportation unions, building trade unions, retired, and sea transport.[16]
Larsen narrowly defeated Republican nominee John Koster to win a sixth term.
Larson was endorsed by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer on October 13, 2010.[17]

She is a member of the Republican Party, and is the second youngest female U.S. Representative. She is a former Senior Legislative Aide for U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Spokane) and a former state representative for the 18th Legislative District in Washington State.
Herrera Beutler was born in Glendale, California but moved to Washington at a young age.

Herrera Beutler was elected as Assistant Floor Leader, the youngest member of her party's leadership in the State House. Her first sponsored bill gave tax relief to business owners serving in the military. It was signed into law by Democratic Governor Christine Gregoire on March 27, 2008.[6]
During her time in the House, she also opposed Senate Bill 5967, which mandated equal treatment of the sexes in community athletic programs run by cities, school districts, and private leagues.[7]
Herrera Beutler ran for Washington's 3rd congressional district, which was an open seat of retiring Democratic incumbent Brian Baird. Herrera advanced to the general election with 28% of the vote, well ahead of fellow Republican candidates David Hedrick and David Castillo. State Representative Denny Heck, a Democrat, ranked first with 31% of the vote.[9][10][11]
During her campaign, Herrera Beutler raised over $1.5 million in contributions. 62% of this came from individual contributors; 35%, from political action committees. The biggest single contributor was construction and mining contactor Kiewit Corporation, which gave her campaign over $16,000.[12]
Herrera pledged to provide solutions in Southwest Washington to help stimulate their economy. She praised the Pledge to America released by Congressional Republican leadership, which included ideas such as extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and offering small businesses 20% tax deductions.[13] She distinguished her plans for economic recovery from Democratic nominee Denny Hecks asserting that the country is going in the wrong direction, and she would offer a new approach. Herrera stated in a press release that government needed to be reined in, and that More government spending won't create permanent, private sector jobs; it will jeopardize themwe need government to let entrepreneurs and investors do what they do best and grow businesses. Only then will new jobs be created in Southwest Washington.[14] Although she received support from state Republican leaders U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers and former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, Herrera stressed her independence with statements such as, ""Neither political party has all the answers.""[2] The Columbian has called her ""a rising star in the Republican Party"".[2]
In the November general election, Herrera Beutler defeated Heck 53%-47%. She won five of the district's six counties.[15] Heck would go on to serve in Congress representing the 10th congressional district, which was created after the 2010 Census.[16]
Herrera Beutler announced her intention to seek re-election in January 2012. She quickly outraised her two opponents, Democrat Jon Haugen, and Independent Norma Jean Stevens. She won the open primary with 61% of the vote.[17] By the end of the election, she had raised more than $1.5 million, to Haugen's $10,000.[18] In the November general election, she defeated Haugen 60%-40%.[19]

Shortly before winning office, Herrera Beutler was named one of Time Magazine's 40 under 40, adding, ""The Washington Republican survived a Tea Party challenge to win the GOP primary in the Evergreen State's 3rd Congressional District. Now Herrera, a 31-year-old Latina and former congressional staffer, has successfully re-cast herself as the outsider as she takes on a longtime Democratic pol in November."" [23]
On December 22, 2010, she announced that she had taken her husband's name and would thenceforth call herself Jaime Herrera Beutler.[1]
On January 24, 2011, Herrera Beutler cosponsored a U.S. Constitutional Amendment that would require the federal government to balance its budget every year. The balanced budget amendment would require the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress for approval, but provides an exception in times of national emergencies.[24]
On March 10, Herrera Beutler introduced her first bill as a member of Congress. The ""Savings Start With Us"" Act would reduce the salaries of Members of Congress, the President and the Vice President of the United States by 10%. In a letter to Congress, Herrera said it was unfair that Congress has voted to remove billions from the budget without cutting their own paychecks, and that this bill would bring us [Congress] in line with the reductions we're asking the rest of the federal government to absorb.[25][26] The bill has been co-sponsored by Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.
On November 15, 2011, Herrera Beutler announced that she would co-sponsor a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing insider trading among members of Congress. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, originally introduced by her predecessor, Democrat Brian Baird, would prohibit members of Congress from profiting from nonpublic information they obtain through their positions.[27]
In September 2012, Herrera Beutler praised the FAA for delaying restrictions on Vancouver's Pearson Field that were to go into effect in that month. She had encouraged the FAA to table the decision on September 17, and it was tabled on September 24.[28] Herrera joined a group of 15 congressmen, including fellow Washingtonians Doc Hastings, Dave Reichert, and Jim McDermott, in October 2012, in writing a letter to the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture and Trade asking them to reconsider two new regulations imposed on goods exported to or imported from the United States, as Indonesia has consistently been one of the top five importers of Washington's apples, bringing in $57 million 2010 alone.[29]
On January 17, 2012, Congressional Quarterly's annual study found Hererra Beutler to be very Republican, voting with her party 92% of the time, while she only supports President Barack Obama 25% of the time.[30] Herrera's partisan reputation has softened however as her stay in Congress has lengthened.[31]
After the birth of her daughter (who was diagnosed with Potter's syndrome) Abigail's birth in July 2013, Herrera Beutler announced via a press release she would still be active in the house for key votes, such as the vote to intervene in the Syrian civil war, although she would be dedicating a lot of her personal time to the care of her daughter. She did not disclose what her vote would be on the Syrian war, but said that it was an important decision and one which she needed to be there for.[32][33][34]
In June 2014, Herrera Beutler proposed the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act, would help coordinate care for children met with medical complexities in Medicaid.[35] The bill was passed to a committee and has yet to see a floor vote.[36]
Herrera Beutler holds generally conservative positions. She is pro-life, having received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee in 2012. Regarding the environment, Herrera Beutler has a lifetime score of 9% from the League of Conservation Voters.[38] On economic issues, Herrera Beutler supports defense spending cuts in order to cut back the national deficit, no new taxes on any tax bracket, and supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare). She voted for Congressman Paul Ryan's budget, which would have lowered taxes for the highest earners from 35% to 25% and also changed Medicare to be a voucher-system.[39] She supports gun ownership rights, does not support requiring background checks for gun registration, and has received an A rating from the National Rifle Association.[40][41] She has stated that marriage ""is between one man and one woman.""[42]
In August 2008, Herrera Beutler married Daniel Beutler, who works for SeaPort Airlines.[1] The couple lives in Camas, Washington.[8] In May 2013, Herrera Beutler announced they were expecting their first child. In June 2013, Herrera Beutler announced her unborn child had been diagnosed with Potter's Syndrome, abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal. She is only the ninth woman in history to give birth while serving in the United States Congress.[43][44] On July 29, 2013, it was announced that the baby had been born two weeks earlier, at 28 weeks' gestation. The girl was born without kidneys, becoming the first child in recorded medical history to breathe on her own without both kidneys. In a Facebook post, Herrera Beutler said, ""She is every bit a miracle."" They have named the child Abigail.[45][46] On July 24, 2013, Herrera Beutler was absent for a roll call vote concerning the NSA, where she cited health reasons. When she revealed the birth of her daughter, it was realized that the birth was her reason for missing what was considered an important vote.[47]
In a September press release, Herrera Beutler announced that Abigail was getting healthier. ""I'm pleased to report that her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future,"" Herrera Beutler said in a press release. ""Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges."" [34] She added that she would have to spend a lot of personal time taking care of her daughter, who is expected to be the first person in medical history to survive Potter's syndrome, but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes.[32][33] The multi-million dollar medical costs for these admittedly ""experimental procedures"" for Abigail, who will later require a kidney transplant along with lifelong immuno-suppressant drugs, is being covered by Medicare and the mother's congressional medical coverage.[48] In early December, it was announced that Herrera Beutler's daughter would be going home from the hospital, nearly 6 months after her birth.[49][50]"

In 2009, Christine Gregoire, former Democratic Governor of Washington, appointed Newhouse to head the state's agriculture department.[2] When Democrat Jay Inslee was sworn in as the state's new governor in 2013, he opted not to retain Newhouse.[3][4]
Newhouse successfully contested the seat representing Washington's 4th congressional district, in the 2014 elections.[3] He and fellow Republican Clint Didier advanced to the November election after finishing in the top two in the August primary election,[5] marking the first time that two Republican candidates would square off in a general election since the state adopted the ""top two"" primary system. The race on November 4 was very close, and was seen as a battle between the factions of the GOP; Newhouse is considered a mainstream Republican while Didier openly identifies with the Tea Party movement. Ultimately, on November 7, media outlets called the race for Newhouse after he built an insurmountable lead due almost entirely to winning his native Yakima County. Ultimately, Newhouse won by a margin of 51%-49%.[6][7]
Newhouse was raised on a farm in Sunnyside, east of Yakima, by his parents, Ruth and Irv Newhouse, with four sisters and a brother. Both of his parents and all of his siblings graduated from WSU.

In late 2013, she wrote a letter blasting Democrats and accusing them of being ""openly hostile to American values and the Constitution"" and citing the Affordable Care Act and immigration as evidence that President Obama ""rule[s] by decree.""[34] In her position as Chair, she blamed the Affordable Care Act for causing unemployment and when FactCheck.org reported studies that proved the opposite and asked her office for evidence to support her claims, ""McMorris Rodgers office got back to us not with an answer, but with a question.""[35]
McMorris Rodgers sponsored legislation that would speed the licensing process for dams and promote energy production. According to a Department of Energy study, retrofitting the largest 100 dams in the country could produce enough power for an additional 3.2 million homes. The legislation reached President Obamas desk without a single dissenter on Capitol Hill.[36]
In January 2014, it was announced that McMorris Rodgers would be giving the Republican response to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address. The decision was made by House Speaker John Boehner and Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.[37][38] McMorris Rodgers is the twelfth woman to give the response[39] and fifth female Republican, but only the third Republican to do so solo, after New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 1995[40] and the Spanish response by Florida Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the most senior female Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, in 2011. Ros-Lehtinen also gave the Spanish response this year, which was largely a translation of McMorris Rogers' remarks.[41]
The following month, the Office of Congressional Ethics recommended the United States House Committee on Ethics initiate a probe into allegations by a former McMorris Rodgers staff member that the congresswoman had improperly mixed campaign money and official funds to help win the 2012 GOP leadership race against Rep.

University of Illinois","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McDermott","Jim McDermott","Democratic","Psychiatrist, Washington State Senate","Episcopalian","James Adelbert ""Jim"" McDermott (born December 28, 1936) is the U.S. Representative for Washington's 7th congressional district, serving since 1989. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The 7th District includes most of Seattle, Vashon Island, Tukwila, Burien, Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, Woodway and Edmonds. He serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and is a member of the House Progressive Caucus. He was formerly the committee chairman, then in 1995, ranking minority member on the House Ethics Committee.


McDermott was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Roseanna (Wabel) and William McDermott.[1] He was the first member of his family to attend college;[citation needed] he graduated from Wheaton College, Illinois, and then went to medical school, getting an M.D. from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago in 1963.[citation needed] After completing an internship from 1963 to 1964 at Buffalo General Hospital in Buffalo, New York, a two-year psychiatry residency at the University of Illinois Research and Educational Hospital (now called University of Illinois Research Hospital), and fellowship training in child psychiatry[citation needed] from 1966 to 1968 at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, he served in the United States Navy Medical Corps as a psychiatrist in California during the Vietnam War.[2][3]
In 1970, McDermott made his first run for public office and was elected to the Washington state legislature as a representative from the 43rd District. He did not seek re-election in 1972 but instead ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Washington. In 1974, he ran for the state senate, and subsequently was re-elected three times, to successive four-year terms.[citation needed] During this time, he crafted and sponsored legislation that would eventually be called the Washington State Basic Health Plan, the first such state program in the country, which offers health insurance to the unemployed and the working poor.[4] In 1980, while still a state senator, McDermott defeated incumbent Dixy Lee Ray in the Democratic primary for governor, but lost the general election to Republican John Spellman. He ran again in 1984, losing the primary to Booth Gardner, who then went on to defeat Spellman in the election.
In 1987, McDermott briefly left politics to become a Foreign Service medical officer based in Zaire now known as Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing psychiatric services to Foreign Service, USAID, and Peace Corps personnel in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 1988, the seat for Washington's 7th congressional district came open when five-term incumbent Mike Lowry gave it up to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate. McDermott returned from Africa to run for the seat. He won handily with 71 percent of the vote. McDermott has been re-elected 11 times with no substantive opposition. He usually gets wide support in his district, the most Democratic white-majority district in the nation, even in disastrous years for Democrats nationally. In 1994, for instance, he won with 75% of the vote even as the Republicans won control of Congress and took all but two seats in Washington (his and that of Norm Dicks). He was re-elected in 2010, taking 83 percent of the vote against independent challenger Bob Jeffers-Schroder. No Republican filed to contest the election in 2010.[5] In 2012 McDermott was challenged in the Democratic primary by attorney Andrew Hughes. Despite spending more than $200,000 on his campaign (versus McDermott's primary spending of $387,000), Hughes won just 6-percent of the vote to McDermott's 71-percent.[6] In the general election, McDermott won just under 80% of the vote, against Republican Ron Bemis.[7]
In his first term, the Congressman sponsored the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, which provides state and local governments with the resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons with AIDS and the families of such persons.[8]
The program established, known as HOPWA, has grown to be a $335M line in United States budget, at a cost of $5,432 per recipient in 2010. Despite the long-term focus of the original legislation, according to HUD, 59% of recipients received help with short-term housing.[9]
This consolidated land in Washington state which allowed the city of Seattle to gain greater control over its primary water source, thus enabling more efficient planning for the future. The bill was one of the last signed by President George H. W. Bush before he left office.[10]
In the fall of 2002, McDermott and fellow Representatives David Bonior of Michigan, Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Mike Thompson of California visited Iraq; in Baghdad they met with members of parliament and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, and in Basra they met with residents who talked about the effect on them of the Iraq sanctions. American conservatives sharply criticised McDermott for this trip, and for his predictions that President George W. Bush would ""mislead the American public"" to justify military action and that no WMD would be found in Iraq.[11]
After this trip, McDermott's opponents dubbed him ""Baghdad Jim"";[12][13] his supporters point out that he has been proven correct on the facts.[14]
According to a disclosure form filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives, the nonprofit organization Life for Relief and Development paid McDermott's $5,510 travel expenses for the Iraq trip. On March 26, 2008, a Bush Administration indictment accused Muthanna Al-Hanooti of arranging for the trip and paying for it with funds from Saddam Hussein's intelligence agency, the IIS.[15] Ultimately these charges were dropped; Al-Hanooti was convicted of attempting to sell Iraqi oil to raise money for humanitarian purposes without permission of the U.S. Treasury.[16]
This act lowered tariffs and spurred apparel trade with many African countries. The AGOA has brought approximately 15,000 jobs and $340 million in foreign investment to some of the poorest nations in sub-Saharan Africa.[17] On August 22, 2007, McDermott was knighted by King Letsie III of Lesotho, in recognition of McDermott's leadership on the Act.[18][19]
This piece of legislation strengthened privacy and confidentiality of people already receiving care under the Act and modernized it by prohibiting cyberstalking as defined under the law.[20]
On April 28, 2004, Congressman McDermott omitted the phrase ""under God"" while leading the House in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The incident occurred after atheist Michael Newdow lost his court case to have the phrase ""under God"" dropped from the Pledge, and after McDermott had voted against a congressional resolution that called for overturning a court ruling that declared the phrase unconstitutional. In 1954, during the McCarthy era and communism scare, Congress had passed a bill, which was signed into law, to add the words ""under God.""[21] McDermott later stated that he had ""reverted to the pledge as it was written and taught in the public schools throughout my childhood"", as the phrase ""under God"" was added in 1954, the year in which McDermott graduated from high school;[22] he turned 18 in late December of that year, after graduating.[23]
In December 2004, the House Ethics Committee investigated McDermott over the leaking of an illegally recorded telephone conversation during a 1997 committee investigation of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich.
In the conversation, Mr. Gingrich, his lawyer and several other Republican Congressmen discussed how Gingrich's Congressional allies should deal with the political consequences of his admission that he had violated House ethics rules by giving inaccurate information to the House Ethics Committee for its inquiry into his use of tax-exempt funds. Democrats have described the conversation as evidence that Mr. Gingrich broke an agreement with the Ethics Committee that he would not orchestrate a politically motivated response to those committee findings.[24]
The recording was made by John and Alice Martin, who claimed that they had overheard the conversation on a police scanner, decided to record it for posterity's sake, and then decided that it might be important for the Ethics Committee to hear.[25] The Martins gave the tape to McDermott because he was the senior Democrat on the Ethics Committee.[26] Within two days, reportedly after the Republican Ethics Committee Chair Nancy L. Johnson refused to allow a vote on making the tape part of the committee's records, sending the tape to the Justice Department, or taking any action against participants in the conversation,[27] and over the warning of the Committee's counsel of possible legal liability, McDermott gave the tape to several media outlets, including the New York Times.
Rep. John Boehner, who was part of the Gingrich conversation, sued McDermott in his capacity as a private citizen, seeking punitive damages for violations of his First Amendment rights.[28] After U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered McDermott to pay Boehner for ""willful and knowing misconduct"" that ""rises to the level of malice"", McDermott appealed, arguing that since he had not created the recording, his actions were allowed under the First Amendment, and that ruling against him would have 'a huge chilling effect' on reporters and newsmakers alike. Eighteen news organizations  including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The Associated Press, the New York Times and the Washington Post  filed a brief backing McDermott.[29] On March 29, 2006, the court ruled 21 that McDermott violated federal law when he turned over the illegally recorded tape to the media outlets, ordering McDermott to pay Boehner's legal costs (over $600,000) plus $60,000 in damages. On June 26, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the judgment, deciding to re-hear the case with all nine judges.[30] However, a split 4 to 1 to 4 en banc decision in Boehner v. McDermott, 484 F.3d 573 (D.C. Cir. 2007) affirmed the three-judge panel, but on different grounds;[31] the Supreme Court declined review.[32] [33] On March 31, 2008, Chief Judge Thomas Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered McDermott to pay Boehner $1.05 million in attorney's fees, costs and interest. McDermott also paid over $60,000 in fines and close to $600,000 in his own legal fees.[34]
The Ethics Committee formally rebuked McDermott in 2006, writing he had ""violated ethics rules by giving reporters access to an illegally taped telephone call involving Republican leaders a decade ago. Rep. McDermott's secretive disclosures to the news media ... risked undermining the ethics process"" and that McDermott's actions ""were not consistent with the spirit of the committee.""[35] Previously, the Martins pleaded guilty to violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. In 1997, Gingrich was reprimanded by the House for providing false information to the Ethics Committee and he agreed to reimburse $300,000 in costs.
This amendment to the Defense Authorization Act of 2006 directed the Department of Defense to study possible adverse health effects of the use of depleted uranium by the US military on servicemembers, employees and their families.[36]
A reform in the American foster care system, this legislation addresses needs affecting foster children in the United States; it extends federal foster care payments until children are 21 years old, provides federal support for relatives caring for foster children, increases access to foster care and adoption services by to Native American tribes, and improves oversight of the health and education needs of children in foster care.[37]
McDermott has overseen[citation needed] the emergency unemployment compensation extensions during the recession that began in 2008 under the George W. Bush Administration and has continued into the administration of Barack Obama.[38]
H.R. 3174 required the US Army Board for Correction of Military Records to review dozens of convictions that followed the Fort Lawton Riot. The Board uncovered ""egregious error"" in the prosecution, overturned the convictions, issued retroactive honorable discharges to the defendants and ordered back pay.[39] H.R. 5130 provided that such payments, which were otherwise of amounts considered nominal, to include interest.[40]
The purpose of this act was to encourage job creation, strengthen the economic recovery, and assist those unable to find jobs during the serious economic downturn that began in 2008.[41] While the bill had unrelated provisions, the primary focus was on the extension of the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit; opinion is divided as to the effectiveness of the program.[42]
This legislation requires publicly traded companies in the United States exercise due diligence to ensure that conflict minerals (gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten) in their products do not come from mines funding civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Originally proposed as a standalone bill, it became section 1502 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. A United Nations Security Council committee reported that this legislation was a ""catalyst"" for efforts to save lives by cutting off a key source of funding for armed groups [43] at a cost to American firms of approximately $8 billion per year.[44]
McDermott sponsored a bill which would have eliminated the tax burden incurred by married same sex couples, same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners. The bill also would have ensured that domestic partners of federal civilian employees receive the same health care benefits as married spouses, including retirement, compensation for work injuries, and full life and health insurance benefits. It was eventually folded into and taken out of the House Health Care Bill in 2010, and has been referred to committee both times, where it died. Versions of this bill were co-sponsored under McDermott's leadership since the 106th Congress with Republican Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. The 2010 (111th Congress) and 2011 (112th Congress) bills were co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.[45]
In April 2012, McDermott was one of over 270 congressmen and congresswomen who co-sponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which will ""require a full audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks by the Comptroller General of the United States before the end of 2012"" if it is passed.[46]
In June 2011, McDermott introduced The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act (H.R. 2230) along with John Campbell (R-Calif.) and Barney Frank (D-Mass).[47] This represented McDermotts fifth introduction of such an act, which would offer a tax structure should online gambling become fully legalized and regulated within the United States.[48]
On June 6, 2013 McDermott addressed victims of the IRS Scandal, showing sympathy and publicly stating that what had occurred was unacceptable, while also pointing out that the conservative groups would not have been targeted at all had they not filed for tax relief. Congressman Paul Ryan subsequently suggested that blaming the victims was inappropriate, and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly interviewed Congressman McDermott on less than cordial terms, causing McDermott to demand she stop putting words in his mouth.
Formerly ranking majority leader, then, in 1995, as the minority member of the Ethics Committee after Republicans retook control of the House.
McDermott belongs to several dozen Congressional caucuses, and co-chairs the following caucuses:
He has two adult children and three grandchildren.[49]"

Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in the Sea-Tac area of Washington State, Smith was adopted as an infant by Lelia June (ne Grant) and his maternal uncle Ben Martin Smith III.[1][2] He attended Bow Lake Elementary and Chinook Middle School, before graduating from Tyee High School in 1983. While in high school Smith participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program. His father, who worked for United Airlines as a ramp serviceman and was active in the Machinists' Union, died when Smith was 19.[3]
Smith attended Western Washington University in Bellingham for a year, later graduating from Fordham University in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He completed a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the University of Washington in 1990. He worked his way through college by loading trucks for United Parcel Service. After law school, Smith worked as a private practice attorney with Cromwell, Mendozza, and Belur. From 1993 to 1995, he served as a prosecutor for the city of Seattle. In 1996, he worked temporarily as a pro tem judge.
In 1993, Adam married Spokane native, Sara Bickle-Eldridge, a graduate of the University of Washington and Seattle University School of Law. Their daughter, Kendall, was born in July 2000, followed by their son, Jack, in June 2003.
Smith served in the Washington State Senate from 1991 to 1997. He was just twenty-five years old at the time of his election in 1990, defeating a 13-year incumbent Republican, Eleanor Lee, to become the youngest State Senator in the country. Smith won his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996 by defeating another incumbent Republican, religious conservative Randy Tate. Smith hasn't faced serious opposition since, and turned what was originally drawn as a ""fair fight"" district into a fairly safe Democratic seat.
Smith's district was significantly redrawn after the 2010 census. It absorbed much of southeast Seattle, as well as most of the Eastside. As a result, it became the state's first with a majority of residents who are racial or ethnic minorities.[4] It is also the second-most Democratic district in the state; only the neighboring 7th district is more Democratic. For the 2012 election, Smith moved from his longtime home in Tacoma to Bellevue.
He has been a leader in moderate, ""New Democrat"" organizations. He serves as the chair of the political action committee of the New Democrat Coalition.
On October 10, 2002, Adam Smith was among the 81 Democratic members of the House voting in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.[5] In March 2012, Smith said that US troops had done amazing work in Afghanistan and that it was time to bring the troops home.[6]
In 2006, Smith won his sixth term in Congress. His opponent was Republican Steve Cofchin. Smith won 65.7% of the vote to Cofchin's 34.3%.[7]
In April 2007, Smith threw his support behind Senator Barack Obama for the 2008 Presidential Election.[8] He has also appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews speaking for Obama. In the same year he also appeared on the Colbert Report, in the show's 434 part series known as ""Better Know A District"".
Smith voted against the Protect America Act of 2007, which has been criticized for violating American citizens' civil liberties by allowing for wiretapping without issued warrants.[9] However, Smith voted in favor of the 2001 Patriot Act and in favor of extending the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program.[10]
In 2008, Smith won a seventh term in the House by defeating James Postma, a 74-year-old retired engineer running on a pro-nuclear power platform, with 65% of the vote.[11]
On December 16, 2010, Smith defeated Silvestre Reyes and Loretta Sanchez to become the Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee after Chairman Ike Skelton was defeated for re-election. In the first round, Sanchez and Smith earned 64 votes with Reyes earning 53. In the runoff, Smith defeated Sanchez by 11 votes.[12]
In 2011, recognized for his work in fighting global poverty, Smith became only the second member of Congress selected to the Borgen Project's Board of Directors.[13] In the same year, Smith argued against cuts that could jeopardize our national security which could leave the US more vulnerable to nuclear terrorism.[14]
In 2001, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),[15] which gave the President authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those who committed and aided the 9/11 attacks. While this power has been rarely used to detain persons in the United States, Smith introduced a bill to ensure that any individual detained on U.S. soil under the AUMF has access to due process and the federal court system.[16] The bill also prohibits military commissions and indefinite detention for individuals detained in the United States and affirms that any trial proceedings shall have all the due process as provided for under the Constitution.
The congressman co-sponsored, with Republican congressman Mac Thornberry, an amendment to the fiscal 2013 defense spending bill reversing previous bans on disseminating Defense and State Department propaganda in the United States, reversing the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, designed to protect U.S. audiences from government misinformation campaigns.[17] The bill passed on May 18, 2012 with 299 to 120.[18]
Smith was among 32 Congressmen who have favorably edited their own Wikipedia entries.

He is a member of the Republican Party. McKinley was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1981 to 1994, and he was Chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party from 1990 to 1994.


After graduating with his B.S. degree in engineering from Purdue University, McKinley worked as a civil engineer for 12 years until founding his own firm, McKinley and Associates, based in Wheeling. The 40-member firm has been involved in $1 billion in construction projects over the past 30 years. Many of McKinley's projects have been government-funded, which has made for an uneasy peace between McKinley and his 'tea-party' constituents.[1]
McKinley has renovated structures of historic significance in West Virginia communities such as the Capitol Theatre in Wheeling. The venue for years was home to the legendary Jamboree, USA.[2]
McKinley represented the 3rd District in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1981 until 1994. He was a fiscal conservative, opposing virtually every state budget during his 14 years as a lawmaker.[3][4]
From 1990 to 1994, McKinley was chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party. As chairman, he was very critical of West Virginia's two Democratic senators. In 1991, he criticized U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller for running for president against President George H. W. Bush.[5] In 1994, he criticized U.S. Senator Robert Byrd for opposing a Balanced Budget Amendment.[6]
In 1996, McKinley ran for governor against Astronaut Jon McBride and Cecil Underwood, a former governor, but lost to Underwood who went on to win the general election that year.[7]
McKinley decided to run in West Virginia's 1st congressional district. The Democratic incumbent, Alan Mollohan, lost the Democratic primary to moderate State Senator Mike Oliverio.[8] McKinley won the six-candidate Republican primary field with 35% of the vote. Mac Warner ranked second with 27% of the vote and State Senator Sarah Minear ranked third with 21% of the vote.[9]
David McKinley received many endorsements during his 2010 campaign, including Parkersburg News,[10] National Right to Life,[11] the West Virginians for Life PAC,[11] the National Federation of Independent Business,[12] House Republicans Fund,[13] West Virginia Farm Bureau,[14] and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.[15]
McKinley narrowly defeated Oliverio, 50.4%-49.6%, a difference of just 1,440 votes or 0.8% margin.[16][17] He became only the fourth person to represent the district since 1953.
McKinley ran for re-election in 2012 in the newly redrawn 1st district. He faced Democratic candidate Sue Thorn, a former community organizer, in the general election. On November 6, 2012, McKinley defeated Thorn 62%-38%, winning every county in the district.[18]
In 2013, McKinley announced that he would not be a candidate for the open United States Senate seat being vacated by Jay Rockefeller in 2014.[19][20]
McKinley defeated the Democratic nominee, West Virginia State Auditor Glen Gainer III in the general election 64%-36%.
McKinley has broken ranks with the Republican majority a few times in his tenure in Congress. In April 2011, McKinley was one of only four Republican members of Congress to vote against the Republican budget proposal of 2012.[21] He explained ""As it relates to the Medicare, I applaud what Paul Ryan was trying to do, because we need to have an adult conversation about it. The Congressional Budget Office determined that some of the out-of-pocket costs could double for seniors and that sent up a red flag for me that we need to look at it.""[22]
In October 2011, he was the only Republican to vote against all three of the trade deals passed by Congress: Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.[23] He said Free trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA have been nothing more than broken promises that shipped our jobs overseas, and I wont vote for any free trade agreements unless theyre fair to my constituents.[24]
McKinley has expressed concern over the ""unchecked spending"" of the United States, which he says results in us being ""beholden to countries like China and Japan who own a significant amount of our debt.""[25]
David McKinley is an active supporter of the Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act. Also known as the Stop the War on Coal Act, fights to protect American jobs and prevents against future legislation from being passed that would reduce mining jobs. McKinley believes, ""The constant attacks on coal have to stop."" [26] McKinley was one of 233 representatives who were in favor of the act that passed earlier this year in September 2012. Also, McKinley feels, Our job creators need a consistent and predictable regulatory program that will protect jobs we have and create new one. [27] McKinley strongly supports keeping jobs in America and protecting workers rights.
McKinley is a strong supporter of the notion that people should be allowed to carry a concealed weapon. McKinley has been consistent in his voting patterns regarding gun control and continued this trend when voting yes to Requiring State Reciprocity for Carrying Concealed Firearms. He has received an A rating from the National Rifle Association this past year. In 2012 the NRA is one of McKinleys main endorsers.
McKinley is a supporter of the Pro-Life movement. He believes, ""The use of federal funds to pay for ending the life of an unborn child is appalling. [28] Since he contains this set of beliefs he voted for the passing of the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in July 2012, which did not pass. This act would prohibit an abortion in the District of Columbia. McKinley consistently votes in support of the Pro-Life movement. Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee gave McKinley an A rating for his constant support in 2011- Present.
In May 2014, McKinley offered an amendment to the Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 that bars the Department of Defense from using funds to assess climate change and its implications for national security. [29] This despite a Department of Defense report that found that climate change impacts are threat multipliers, and that the rapid rise of global temperatures and associated extreme weather events could ""exacerbate conditions that enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence."" The amendment passed on a near party-line vote.
On May 23, 2013, McKinley introduced the Better Buildings Act of 2014 (H.R. 2126; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. The bill would amend federal law aimed at improving the energy efficiency of commercial office buildings.[30] The bill would also create a program called ""Tenant Star"" similar to the existing Energy Star program.[31] McKinley argued in favor of the bill, saying that ""finding ways to use energy efficiently is common sense. We ought to be promoting efficiency as a way to save energy, money and create jobs.""[32]
David McKinley is a seventh-generation resident of Wheeling, West Virginia and father of four children. He has six grandchildren. His wife, Mary, has been a critical care nurse for 39 years. She holds a masters degree in nursing.[2]"

Mooney (born June 7, 1971) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for West Virginia's 2nd congressional district since 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party. He served in the Maryland State Senate, representing District 3, from 1999 to 2011 and is a former Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party. He is the first Hispanic elected to Congress in West Virginia history.[1]


Mooney's mother was a Cuban refugee who escaped from political imprisonment shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[2] From a family of Irish immigrants, his father Vincent grew up in Long Island, New York. Mooney was born in 1971 in Washington D.C. He graduated from Frederick High School. There he was elected as Student Government Association President.[2] In 1993, he received his B.A. in philosophy from Dartmouth College. While attending Dartmouth, he ran for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Grafton County's 10th District. He finished in last place with 8% of the vote.[3]
After college, Mooney served as staff assistant to U.S. Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, remaining as his assistant until 1995. That year, he became a legislative analyst for the Republican Conference of the U.S. House of Representatives.[4]
In addition to his political work, Mooney also is a member of the Knights of Columbus. He served as the executive director of the National Journalism Center from 2005-2012. In 2007, Mooney was elected to the Executive Committee of the Dartmouth College Association of Alumni.[5]
He formerly represented Maryland's District 3rd, which covers parts of Washington and Frederick Counties.
Mooney has run for public office in three different states: New Hampshire, Maryland, and West Virginia.[6] His first run for public office was in New Hampshire, where he lost a bid for the New Hampshire State House while attending Dartmouth College. Mooney was a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1999 through 2011. He is currently running for Congress in West Virginia. When Mooney ran for the Maryland Senate in 1998, he defeated incumbent Republican John W. Derr in the primary election and Democrat Ronald S. Bird in the general election.[7] In 2002, Mooney won re-election defeating Democrat Sue Hecht, with 55% of the vote.[8] Mooney won re-election in 2006 with 52% of the vote against Candy Greenway.[9] In 2010, Democrat Ronald N. Young, Mayor of Frederick defeated him 51%-49%.[10][11]
Mooney received the Maryland Taxpayer of the Year award in 2000 and the National Hero of the Taxpayer Award for 2003. He has also received the top business rating in the state by the Maryland Business for Responsive Government.
Mooney traveled to New Hampshire to testify in support of a state bill that would require legislative approval for amendments that the private Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College wished to make to its charter.[12]
In the Maryland State Senate, Mooney was a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, the Joint Committee on Investigation, and formerly a member of the Joint Committee on Federal Relations, and the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. He served on the Maryland Rural Caucus, the Taxpayers Protection Caucus, and the Maryland Veterans Caucus.
On December 11, 2010, Mooney was elected as Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party. He was Chairman until early 2013.
After redistricting, 85 year old Republican incumbent U.S. Congressman Roscoe Bartlett was placed into a district that Obama won. Portions of Baltimore and Harford counties as well as Carroll County were taken away from the 6th District during redistricting. More of Montgomery County was put into the district, while another part of Montgomery County was removed and added to northern Frederick County to reform the 6th District.[13] The new district had Obama at just 40%, while the former district had Obama at 56%.[14] After creating an exploratory committee to run for the nomination,[15] Mooney decided not to challenge Bartlett.[16]
In March 2012, Mooney filed as a candidate in the 2014 Republican primary for Maryland's 6th congressional district. However, he subsequently had to withdraw his candidacy because he was still Bartlett's part-time outreach director at the time he filed papers to run in 2014. House ethics rules do not allow congressional staffers to remain employed in a congressional office while campaigning.[17][18]
Mooney subsequently moved to West Virginia and declared his candidacy for West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. Seven-term Republican incumbent Shelley Moore Capito was giving up the seat to run for the United States Senate.[19] During his campaign, Mooney was accused by Democrats that he was a ""carpetbagger,"" since he recently moved to West Virginia.[20]
He received the Republican Party nomination on May 13 beating six other opponents in the Republican primary. Mooney won 15 of the 17 counties in the congressional district with an overall total of 36.02 percent of the vote.[21] Mooney faced Democrat Nick Casey in the 2014 General Election.[22]
On November 4, 2014, Mooney defeated Casey in the general election, 49 percent to 47 percent. He won Berkeley County, in the state's Eastern Panhandle, by 5,000 votesmore than the overall margin of 4,900 votes.[23] Mooney was also helped by long coattails from Capito, who carried every county in the district (and the state).[24]
Mooney became the first Latino elected to West Virginia's congressional delegation in the state's history.[1]
Mooney was sworn in on January 6, 2015."

He is a member of the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations.[1] He is a member of the Republican Party.
He is a U.S. Congressman, having defeated incumbent Nick Rahall in an election for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from West Virginia's 3rd congressional district in 2014.[2]
Jenkins was a member of the West Virginia Senate from the 5th District, which contains Cabell County and a small portion of Wayne County. He served in both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature in Charleston over the course of 20 years, having been elected as a member of the House in 1994, and elected to the Senate in 2002.[3]


Jenkins, a lifelong resident of Huntington, is the son of Dorothy C. Jenkins and the late John E. Jenkins, Jr.[4][5][6] He attended public schools.[5]
Jenkins earned his B.S. in Education/Business Administration from the University of Florida in 1983.[5][7] He went on to earn his J.D. from Cumberland School of Law in 1987.[7][8]
He was the Executive Director of the West Virginia State Medical Association, and taught business law as an instructor at Marshall University.[9][10] He is also the former Co-Chairman of the Health Care Committee in the West Virginia State Chamber of Commerce.[11]
Jenkins served on both sides of the legislature in Charleston, having first been elected as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1994.[3] He lost a race for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in 2000.[12]
Jenkins was then elected to the West Virginia State Senate in 2002, after defeating Democratic incumbent Marie Redd in the primary election and former State Senator Thomas Scott in the general election. In 2006, Jenkins once again defeated Redd in the primary election, and Scott in the general election (with 64% of the vote).[13] In 2010, Jenkins was again re-elected to the West Virginia State Senate, District 5, running unopposed in the general election.[14]
In July 2013, Jenkins announced he was switching to the Republican Party in preparation for a run at West Virginia's 3rd congressional district seat, held by 19-term Democrat Nick Rahall. He had actually grown up as a Republican, but became a Democrat in 1992 prior to his run for the House of Delegates. On switching parties, Jenkins stated that: West Virginia is under attack from Barack Obama and a Democratic Party that our parents and grandparents would not recognize.""[15] West Virginia's 3rd district had long been a Democratic stronghold, but had been swept up in the growing Republican tide that had swept the state since the turn of the century. In 2012, it went for Mitt Romney 66-32 percent, making it the second-most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat.[16] Jenkins and Rahall had contributed to each other's campaigns in the decade's previous election cycles.[17]
Jenkins ran unopposed in the Republican primary.[18] He faced Rahall in the general election in November 2014. An early poll showed Jenkins with a double-digit lead over Rahall.[16]
The National Right to Life Committee, West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, and West Virginians for Life, all of which had previously supported Rahall, supported Jenkins in 2014, and the West Virginia Coal Association endorsed Jenkins in September 2014.[19][20]
As of September 18, 2014, the race was rated a ""toss up"" by both University of Virginia political professor Larry Sabato, of Sabato's Crystal Ball, and Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report.[21] As of October 2, managing editor Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball said the race was still a toss-up, calling it ""Super close, super expensive and super nasty.""[22][23] Rahall outspent Jenkins in the election by a two-to-one ratio.[24]
In the general election, Jenkins defeated Rahall, taking 55.3% of the vote to 44.7%--the second-largest margin of defeat suffered by an incumbent in the 2014 cycle. [2][25] As a measure of how Democratic much of this district once was, when Jenkins took office on January 3, 2015, he became the first Republican to represent what is now the 3rd since 1957 (the district was numbered as the 4th before 1993), and the first Republican to represent most of the district's southern portion since 1933 (most of which was the 5th district before it was eliminated in 1973).[26][27][28] In addition, Jenkins' victory, along with those of Alex Mooney and David McKinley, meant that West Virginia had an all-Republican House delegation for the first time since 1923.
Jenkins supports the repeal of Obamacare, and states that he would replace the law.[29] He also opposes federal cap and trade restrictions on coal emissions.[30] He feels that the Environmental Protection Agency engages in over-reach, both with regard to the coal industry and to the EPA's efforts to enforce tighter emissions control regulations on wood-burning home stoves.[31][32] He believes that ""the central role of the federal government"" is to keep the US military strong, and supports funding that maintains the country ""as the worlds pre-eminent military power"".[33]
Jenkins and his wife Elizabeth have three children, two sons and one daughter, who attend Cabell County schools.[5][7][34]"

He was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2012 election.[1][2]
On August 11, 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced that he had selected Ryan to be his vice-presidential running mate.[3] Ryan was officially nominated at the Republican convention in Tampa on August 29, 2012.[4] On November 6, 2012, Romney and Ryan were defeated in the general election by the incumbents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, although Ryan won reelection to his congressional seat.[5]
On December 10, 2013, Ryan and Democratic Senator Patty Murray announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.[6][7] The budget agreement was the first to pass Congress with the two chambers controlled by different parties since 1986.[8]


Ryan was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, the youngest of four children of Elizabeth A. ""Betty"" (ne Hutter) and Paul Murray Ryan, a lawyer.[9][10][11] A fifth-generation Wisconsinite, his father was of Irish ancestry and his mother is of German and English ancestry.[12] One of Ryan's paternal ancestors settled in Wisconsin prior to the Civil War.[13] His great-grandfather, Patrick William Ryan (18581917), founded an earthmoving company in 1884, which later became P. W. Ryan and Sons and is now known as Ryan Incorporated Central.[14][15] Ryan's grandfather was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin by President Calvin Coolidge.[16]
Ryan attended St. Mary's Catholic School in Janesville, where he played on the seventh-grade basketball team.[17] He attended Joseph A. Craig High School in Janesville, where he was elected president of his junior class, and thus became prom king.[18] As class president Ryan was a representative of the student body on the school board.[19] Following his second year, Ryan took a job working the grill at McDonald's.[19] He was on his high school's ski, track and varsity soccer teams and played basketball in a Catholic recreational league.[20][21][22] He also participated in several academic and social clubs including the Model United Nations.[19][20] Ryan and his family often went on hiking and skiing trips to the Colorado Rocky Mountains.[10][16]
When he was 16, Ryan found his 55-year-old father lying dead in bed of a heart attack.[16][19] Following the death of his father, Ryan's grandmother moved in with the family, and because she had Alzheimer's, Ryan helped care for her while his mother commuted to college in Madison, Wisconsin.[19] After his father's death Ryan received Social Security survivors benefits until his 18th birthday, which were saved for his college education.[23][24][25]
Ryan majored in economics and political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio,[26] where he became interested in the writings of Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Milton Friedman.[19] He often visited the office of libertarian professor Richard Hart to discuss the theories of these economists and of Ayn Rand.[19][27] Hart introduced Ryan to the National Review,[19] and with Hart's recommendation Ryan began an internship in the D.C. office of Wisconsin Senator Bob Kasten where he worked with Kasten's foreign affairs adviser.[19][28] Ryan also attended the Washington Semester program at American University.[29] Ryan worked summers as a salesman for Oscar Mayer and once got to drive the Wienermobile.[16][27][30] During college, Ryan was a member of the College Republicans,[31] and volunteered for the congressional campaign of John Boehner.[27] He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta social fraternity.[32] Ryan received a Bachelor of Arts in 1992 with a double major in economics and political science.[26]
At a 2005 Washington, D.C. gathering celebrating the 100th anniversary of Ayn Rand's birth,[33][34] Ryan credited Rand as inspiring him to get involved in public service.[35] In a speech that same year at the Atlas Society, he said he grew up reading Rand, and that her books taught him about his value system and beliefs.[36][37] Ryan required staffers and interns in his congressional office to read Rand[37] and gave copies of her novel Atlas Shrugged as gifts to his staff for Christmas.[38][39] In his Atlas Society speech, he also described Social Security as a ""socialist-based system"".[40]
In 2009, Ryan said, ""What's unique about what's happening today in government, in the world, in America, is that it's as if we're living in an Ayn Rand novel right now. I think Ayn Rand did the best job of anybody to build a moral case of capitalism, and that morality of capitalism is under assault.""[38]
In April 2012, after receiving criticism from Georgetown University faculty members on his budget plan, Ryan rejected Rand's philosophy as an atheistic one, saying it ""reduces human interactions down to mere contracts"".[41] He also called the reports of his adherence to Rand's views an ""urban legend"" and stated that he was deeply influenced by his Roman Catholic faith and by Thomas Aquinas.[42] Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute, maintains that Ryan is not a Rand disciple, and that some of his proposals do not follow Rand's philosophy of limited government; Brook refers to Ryan as a ""fiscal moderate"".[43]
In August 2012, after Romney chose him as his running mate, the Associated Press published a story saying that while the Tea Party movement had wanted a nominee other than Romney, it had gotten ""one of its ideological heroes"" in the Vice Presidential slot. According to the article, Ryan supports the Tea Party's belief in ""individual rights, distrust of big government and an allegorical embrace of the Founding Fathers"".[44]
Betty Ryan reportedly urged her son to accept a congressional position as a staff economist attached to Senator Kasten's office, which he did after graduating in 1992.[28][45] In his early years working on Capitol Hill, Ryan supplemented his income by working as a waiter, as a fitness trainer, and at other jobs.[16][30]
A few months after Kasten lost to Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 1992 election, Ryan became a speechwriter for Empower America (now FreedomWorks), a conservative advocacy group founded by Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and William Bennett.[16][46][47] Ryan later worked as a speechwriter for Kemp,[48] the Republican vice presidential candidate in the 1996 United States presidential election. Kemp became Ryan's mentor, and Ryan has said he had a ""huge influence"".[49] In 1995, Ryan became the legislative director for then-U.S. Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. In 1997 he returned to Wisconsin, where he worked for a year as a marketing consultant for the construction company Ryan Incorporated Central, owned by his relatives.[19][46][50]
Ryan was first elected to the House in 1998, winning the 1st District seat of Mark Neumann, a two-term incumbent who had vacated his seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. Ryan won the Republican primary over 29-year-old pianist Michael J. Logan of Twin Lakes,[51] and the general election against Democrat Lydia Spottswood.[52] This made him the second-youngest member of the House.[19]
Reelected seven times, Ryan has never received less than 55 percent of the vote. He defeated Democratic challenger Jeffrey C. Thomas in the 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 elections.[53] (In 2002, Ryan also faced Libertarian candidate George Meyers.) In 2008, Ryan defeated Democrat Marge Krupp in the 2008 election.[53] In the 2010 general election, he defeated Democrat John Heckenlively and Libertarian Joseph Kexel.
Ryan faced Democratic nominee Rob Zerban in the 2012 House election. As of July 25, 2012, Ryan had over $5.4 million in his congressional campaign account, more than any other House member.[54][55] Finance, insurance and real estate was the sector that contributed most to his campaign.[56] Under Wisconsin election law, Ryan was allowed to run concurrently for vice president and for Congress[57] and was not allowed to remove his name from the Congressional ballot after being nominated for the vice presidency.[58] Ryan was reelected in 2012 with 55% of his district's vote.[59]
Ryan became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee in 2007,[60] then chairman in 2011 after Republicans took control of the House. That same year he was selected to deliver the Republican response to the State of the Union address.[61]
During his 13 years in the House, Ryan has sponsored more than 70 bills or amendments,[62] of which two were enacted into law.[63] One, passed in July 2000, renamed a post office in Ryan's district; the other, passed in December 2008, lowered the excise tax on arrow shafts.[64][65] Ryan has also co-sponsored 975 bills,[63] of which 176 have passed.[66] 22 percent of these bills were originally sponsored by Democrats.[63]
In 2010, Ryan was a member of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Bowles-Simpson Commission), which was tasked with developing a plan to reduce the federal deficit. He voted against the final report of the commission.[67]
In 2012, Ryan accused the nation's top military leaders of using ""smoke and mirrors"" to remain under budget limits passed by Congress.[68][69] Ryan later said that he misspoke on the issue and called General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to apologize for his comments.[70]
As of mid-2012, Ryan had been on seven trips abroad as part of a congressional delegation.[71]
In fiscal year 2008, Ryan garnered $5.4 million in congressional earmarks for his constituency, including $3.28 million for bus service in Wisconsin, $1.38 million for the Ice Age Trail, and $735,000 for the Janesville transit system.[73] In 2009, he successfully advocated with the Department of Energy for stimulus funds for energy initiatives in his district.[73] Other home district projects he has supported include a runway extension at the Rock County Airport, an environmental study of the Kenosha Harbor, firefighting equipment for Janesville, road projects in Wisconsin, and commuter rail and streetcar projects in Kenosha.[74] In 2008, Ryan pledged to stop seeking earmarks.[74] Prior to that he had sought earmarks less often than other representatives.[74] Taxpayers for Common Sense records show no earmarks supported by Ryan for fiscal years 2009 and 2010.[73] In 2012 Ryan supported a request for $3.8 million from the Department of Transportation for a new transit center in Janesville,[74] which city officials received in July.[75]
Ryan was an active member of a task force established by Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle that tried unsuccessfully to persuade GM to keep its assembly plant in Janesville open.[76] He made personal contact with GM executives to try to convince them to save or retool the plant, offering GM hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer-funded incentives.[76]
Following the closing of factories in Janesville and Kenosha, constituents expressed dissatisfaction with his votes and support.[77] During the 2011 Congressional summer break, Ryan held town hall meetings by telephone with constituents, but no free, in-person listening sessions. The only public meetings Ryan attended in his district required an admission fee of at least $15.[78][79] In August 2011, constituents in Kenosha and Racine protested when Ryan would not meet with them about economic and employment issues, after weeks of emailed requests from them.[77][78][80] Ryan's Kenosha office locked its doors and filed a complaint with the police, who told the protesters that they were not allowed in Ryan's office.[77][78][80] Ryan maintains a mobile office to serve constituents in outlying areas.[81]
In the 111th Congress, Ryan sided with a majority of his party in 93% of House votes in which he has participated, and sided with the overall majority vote of all House votes 95% of the time.[82]
Ryan has a lifetime American Conservative Union rating of 91/100.[83] The 2011 National Journal Vote Ratings rated Paul Ryan 68.2 on the conservative scale, being more conservative than 68% of the full House, and ranked as the 150th most conservative member based on roll-call votes.[84]
Ryan voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003),[85] the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit,[86][87] and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the $700 billion bank bailout.[88][89] Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House to vote for the auto industry bailout.[90][91][92] A number of commentators have criticized Ryan's votes for what they believe were deficit-causing policies during the George W. Bush administration as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism.[88][93][94][95] In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as being ""not on the level"" for describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two ""unpaid for"" wars.[96] Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012 that ""If you know about Paul Ryan at all, you probably know him as a deficit hawk. But Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star.""[97]
Obama initially viewed Ryan as a Republican who could help to reduce the federal deficit. Speaking of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama called it a ""serious proposal"" and found both points of agreement and disagreement, saying ""some ideas in there that I would agree with, but there are some ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them.""[98]
In 1999, Ryan voted in favor of the GrammLeachBliley Act, which repealed certain provisions of the Depression-era GlassSteagall Act that regulated banking.[99] Ryan sponsored a 2008 bill that would repeal the requirement that the Federal Reserve System reduce unemployment.[62] Ryan voted to extend unemployment insurance in 2002, 2008 and 2009, but has voted against further extensions since then.[100] Ryan voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.[101] Ryan also voted against the Credit CARD Act of 2009 and the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Ryan characterized as ""class warfare"".[102]
Ryan voted against the 2010 health care reform act supported by Obama and congressional Democrats in 2010,[87][103] and to repeal it in 2012.[104][105]
In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose the privatization of Social Security. Ryan's proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain the support of the then-Republican presidential administration.[19]
Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute states that on ""'education, training, employment, and social services,' the Ryan budget would spend 33% less"" than Obama's budget plan over the next decade.[106] In particular, the Ryan plan tightens eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and freezes the maximum Pell Grant award at the current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this would result in more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would begin to accrue interest while students are still in school.[107][108][109] Ryan states that his education policy is to ""allocate our limited financial resources effectively and efficiently to improve education"".[110] Jordan Weissmann of The Atlantic said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to ""cut and privatize"".[109]
Ryan voted for the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001.[111] Ryan is a supporter of for-profit colleges and opposed the gainful employment rule, which would have ensured that vocational schools whose students were unable to obtain employment would stop receiving federal aid.[109] Ryan is a supporter of private school vouchers and voted to extend the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program in 2011.[109] The National Education Association teachers' union has criticized Ryan's positions on education.[111][vague]
Ryan has consistently supported giving the president line-item veto power.[62]
In the fall of 2013 Ryan suggested using discussions regarding raising the federal debt ceiling as ""leverage"" to reduce federal spending.[112][113]
Ryan supported a group of three budget reform bills that were considered in the House during the 113th United States Congress. Ryan supported the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013, a bill that would require the Congressional Budget Office to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.[114] He also supported the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.[115] H.R. 1872 would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[115] H.R. 1872 would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[115] The changes made by H.R. 1872 would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.[116] These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of H.R. 1872 is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.[117] Finally, Ryan supported the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, a bill that would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in CBO's baseline.[118] Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year's appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward.[118] Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that ""families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington.""[119] Ryan said that these three budget reform bills ""are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington.""[116] Ryan said that he thought ""by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem.""[116]
On May 21, 2008, Ryan introduced H.R. 6110, the Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008, commonly referred to as the ""Ryan budget"".[120] This proposed legislation outlined changes to entitlement spending, including a controversial proposal to replace Medicare with a voucher program for those currently under the age of 55.[19][121][122] The Roadmap found only eight sponsors and did not move past committee.[19][123]
On April 1, 2009, Ryan introduced his alternative to the 2010 United States federal budget. This alternative budget would have eliminated the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and imposed a five-year spending freeze on all discretionary spending.[124][125] It would have also phased out Medicare's traditional fee-for-service model; instead it would offer fixed sums in the form of vouchers for those under the age of 55, with which Medicare beneficiaries could buy private insurance.[126] Ryan's proposed budget would also have allowed taxpayers to opt out of the federal income taxation system with itemized deductions, and instead pay a flat 10 percent of adjusted gross income up to $100,000 for couples ($50,000 for singles) and 25 percent on any remaining income.[125] It was ultimately rejected in the Democratic controlled House by a vote of 293137, with 38 Republicans in opposition.[127]
On January 27, 2010, Ryan released a modified version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010.[128][129] The modified plan would provide across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminate income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolish the estate tax, and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also replace the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%.[130] The plan would privatize a portion of Social Security,[131][132] eliminate the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance,[132] and privatize Medicare for those under the age of 55.[131][132] Chief actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's ""Roadmap"" with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had ""some potential"" to make healthcare prices ""more sustainable"", he was more ""confident"" in Ryan's plan.[133]
Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy.[134] Krugman further called the plan a ""fraud"" saying it relies on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and ""dismantling Medicare as we know it"" by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995.[134] In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets.[135] Economist Ted Gayer wrote that ""Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax... makes a useful contribution to this debate.""[136]
In subsequent years, Ryan also developed budget plans that proposed privatizing Medicare for those currently under the age of 55,[137] funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states,[19][138][139] and other changes.
On April 11, 2011, Ryan introduced H.Con.Res. 34, a federal budget for fiscal year 2012.[140] The House passed this Ryan Plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it.[141][142] A month later, the bill was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 5740, with five Republicans and most Democrats in opposition.[143]
On March 23, 2012 Ryan introduced a new version of his federal budget for the fiscal year 2013.[144] On March 29, 2012, the House of Representatives passed the resolution along partisan lines, 228 yeas to 191 nays; ten Republicans voted against the bill, along with all the House Democrats.[145] Ryan's budget seeks to reduce all discretionary spending in the budget from 12.5% of GDP in 2011 to 3.75% of GDP in 2050.[146]
Ryan has proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on the number of people who qualify. His plan would also undo a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care.[19][138][139][147]
An analysis by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone now older than 55.[148] Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the budget for making tough choices. Walker believes it needs to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending.[149] In contrast, David Stockman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget ""is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices"" and would ""do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse"".[150] Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making ""unrealistic assumptions"".[146] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality.[151]
Parts of the 2012 Ryan budget were criticized by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for its proposed cuts to housing and food stamp programs.[152][153] Faculty and administrators of Georgetown University challenged what they called Ryan's ""continuing misuse of Catholic teaching"" when defending his plan,[154][155] but Ryan rejected their criticism.[156]
In March 2013, Ryan submitted a new budget plan for Fiscal Year 2014 to the House. It would set to balance the budget by 2023 by repealing Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and institute federal vouchers into Medicare. [157] Ryan has cited health care, education and food safety as examples of ""runaway"" federal spending.[158] This budget, House Concurrent Resolution 25, was voted on by the House on March 21, 2013 and it passed 221-207.[159] In 2014, Ryan released a refresh of this plan which would reduce spending by 5.1 trillion over a decade; balancing the budget by 2024.[160]
On December 10, 2013, Ryan announced that he and Democratic Senator Patty Murray had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, called the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014.[161] The proposed deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester ($45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January 2014 and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015).[161] The deal offsets the spending increases by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers.[6] Overall the fee increases and spending reductions total about $85 billion over a decade.[162] Ryan said that he was ""proud"" of the agreement because ""it reduces the deficit  without raising taxes.""[163]
Some conservative Republicans objected to Ryan's budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the ""terrible plan,"" saying that ""it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester."" Other conservatives were more positive: It achieves most of the things we would like to see when we have divided government, said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).[6]
Ryan's proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 included deep cuts to domestic spending to reduce projected federal deficits by about $5 trillion over the next decade. In releasing the budget, Ryan stated ""We have to stop spending money we don't have."" According to the White House, Ryan's 2014 budget proposal would increase taxes on middle-class families by an average of $2000, while cutting taxes for the richest Americans.[164][165]
In 2010, Ryan described himself as being ""as pro-life as a person gets""[166] and has been described as an ""ardent, unwavering foe of abortion rights"".[167] As of 2012 according to Bloomberg, Ryan has co-sponsored 38 measures in the U.S. Congress that restrict abortion.[168] The National Right to Life Committee has consistently given Ryan a ""100 percent pro-life voting record"" since he took office in 1999. NARAL Pro-Choice America has noted that Ryan has ""cast 59 votes"" (including procedural motions and amendments which don't have co-sponsors[168]) ""on reproductive rights while in Congress and not one has been pro-choice"".[169] He believes all abortions should be illegal, including those resulting from rape or incest, and only makes an exception for cases where the woman's life is at risk.[170][171]
During Ryan's 1998 campaign for Congress, he ""expressed his willingness to let states criminally prosecute women who have abortions,"" telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at the time that he ""would let states decide what criminal penalties would be attached to abortions"", and while not stating that he supports jailing women who have an abortion, stated: ""if it's illegal, it's illegal.""[170] In 2009, he cosponsored the Sanctity of Life Act, which would provide that fertilized eggs ""shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood"" and would have given ""the Congress, each State, the District of Columbia, and all United States territories  the authority to protect the lives of all human beings residing in its respective jurisdictions"".[172][173][174]
Ryan has also supported legislation that would impose criminal penalties for certain doctors who perform ""partial-birth abortions"".[167] Ryan voted against continued federal aid for Planned Parenthood and Title X family planning programs.[167][175] He also opposed giving over-the-counter status for emergency contraceptive pills.[87][176] Ryan was one of 227 co-sponsors of the 2011 No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act bill in the House of Representatives that would have limited funding for federally funded abortions to victims of ""forcible rape"". ""Forcible rape"" was not defined in the bill, which critics said would result in excluding date rape, statutory rape, or other situations where the victim had diminished mental capacity. The language was removed from the bill before the House passed the bill, the Senate did not vote on the bill.[177]
Ryan opposes same-sex marriage, had previously supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation .[167][171][178] Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would've prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[167] The Human Rights Campaign, a GLBT rights organization, has frequently given Ryan a 0/100 rating on its legislative scorecard.[179] During Paul Ryan's 2012 vice presidential bid, he was endorsed by two gay conservative organizations, GOProud[180] and the Log Cabin Republicans.[181] On April 30, 2013, Ryan came out in favor of same-sex couples adopting children. He also said he had always supported civil unions. He also said that if the US Supreme Court declares the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, then he believes it will become a federalist issue for states to decide same-sex marriage.[182][183]
Ryan has supported the rights of gun owners and opposed stricter gun control measures.[167][184] He voted against a bill for stronger background check requirements for purchases at gun shows and supports federal concealed-carry reciprocity legislation, which would allow a person with a permit to carry a concealed firearm in one state to carry a firearm in every other state, a top National Rifle Association (NRA) priority.[184] Ryan, who owns a rifle and a shotgun, is an NRA member, has received an ""A"" rating from the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action and has been endorsed by the organization every cycle he has been in Congress.
Ryan favors a constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning. He also voted to withdraw federal funding of NPR.[167]
In the past, Ryan supported legislation that would have allowed some illegal immigrants to apply for temporary guest-worker status, including one bill that would provide a pathway to permanent residence status (a Green Card) for such immigrants. However, more recently Ryan ""has adopted a firm anti-amnesty, enforcement-first stance"" on illegal immigration.[185] Ryan voted against the DREAM Act, a bill that would provide conditional permanent residency to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children if they attend college or serve in the military, and meet other criteria.[174] He also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[87][186] Ryan has said ""we must first secure the border and stem the flow of illegal immigration, and then work to increase legal immigration through an enforceable guest worker program"" before pursuing a ""piecemeal"" reform such as the DREAM Act.[187]
Ryan opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act, stating that ""it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse.""[188]
The League of Conservation Voters (LCV), the Sierra Club, and other environmentalists have criticized Ryan's record on environmental issues, with Ryan earning 3 percent on the LCV 2011 National Environmental Scorecard.[189] He opposes cap and trade and opposed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009.[190] In an 2009 editorial, Ryan has accused climatologists of using ""statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change"" and he criticized the EPA's classification of carbon dioxide as a pollutant.[190] Ryan supports a 10-year $40 billion tax break for the petroleum industry, and has proposed cutting funding for renewable energy research and subsidies.[191]
Ryan has spoken out against a ""tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning to value the culture of work.""[192]
In February 2013, Ryan began touring low-income neighborhoods and speaking on efforts to reform federal anti-poverty programs.[193]
On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan released a report titled The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful.[194] In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that ""penalize families for getting ahead"" and that ""the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates,"" both of which ""reduce the incentive to work"".[195] At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.[196] In an appendix titled ""Measures of Poverty"", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements ""[have] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones.""[194][196] According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.[197]
Ryan has been described by Larry Sabato as ""just a generic Republican on foreign policy"".[198][199]
Ryan voted in 2001 and 2004 to end the embargo on Cuba,[200][201][202][203] but later reversed his positions, and, since 2007, has voted for maintaining the embargo.[203] In 2008, Ryan told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""If we're going to have free trade with China, why not Cuba?""[202]
Ryan was a ""reliable supporter of the [George W. Bush] administration's foreign policy priorities"" who voted for the 2002 Iraq Resolution, authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq.[71] Ryan also voted for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007.[71] In May 2012, Ryan voted for H.R. 4310,[citation needed] which would increase defense spending, including spending for the Afghanistan War and for various weapon systems, to the level of $642 billion $8 billion more than previous spending levels.[204]
In 2009, Ryan termed the Obama administrations' ""reset"" of relations with Russia as ""appeasement"".[205] Daniel Larison of The American Conservative wrote that Ryan ""seems to conceive of U.S. power abroad mostly in terms of military strength"" and ""truly is a product of the era of George W. Bush"".[205]
In 2011, Ryan pointed to his support for over $10 billion in cuts to national security spending as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 that included $50 billion in near-term budget cuts and a sequestration system to force further budget cuts.[206] In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration in the hope that this would open common ground with the Democrats on deficit reduction.[207] In January 2013, he said that sequestration would likely occur because the Democrats offered no alternative.[208] Ryan's comments have led defense industry leaders to pin their final hopes on the chance that Congress will at least allow the Pentagon to reprogram the coming cuts.[209] In March 2013, Ryan outlined a budget that provided $2 trillion less for defense over a ten-year period than the platform he had run on the previous fall.[210]
Dan Balz of The Washington Post wrote that Ryan was promoted as a candidate for Vice President ""by major elements of the conservative opinion makers, including The Wall Street Journal editorial page, the Weekly Standard and the editor of National Review"".[211]
On August 11, 2012, the Romney campaign officially announced Ryan as its choice for Vice President through its ""Mitt's VP"" mobile app[212] as well as by the social networking service Twitter,[213] about 90 minutes before Romney's in-person introduction.[citation needed] Before the official announcement in Norfolk, Virginia, it was reported that Romney made his decision, and offered the position to Ryan on August 1, 2012,[214] the day after returning from a foreign policy trip through the United Kingdom, Poland and Israel.[215] On August 11, 2012, Ryan formally accepted Romney's invitation to join his campaign as his running mate, in front of the USS Wisconsin in Norfolk.[216] Ryan is the major parties' first-ever vice-presidential candidate from Wisconsin.[217]
According to a statistical-historical analysis conducted by Nate Silver, ""Ryan is the most conservative Republican member of Congress to be picked for the vice-presidential slot since at least 1900"" and ""is also more conservative than any Democratic nominee [for vice president who previously served in the Congress] was liberal, meaning that he is the furthest from the center"" of any vice presidential candidate chosen from Congress since the turn of the 20th century.[218] This analysis, using the DW-NOMINATE statistical system,[218] has been described as ""one of the more statistically rigorous approaches to Ryan's congressional voting record"".[219] Political scientist Eric Schickler commented that while Ryan ""may well be the most conservative vice presidential nominee in decades,"" the NOMINATE methodology ""is not suited to making claims about the relative liberalism or conservatism of politicians"" over a long time span.[219] A USA Today/Gallup poll found that 39% thought Ryan was an ""excellent"" or ""pretty good"" vice presidential choice, compared to 42% who felt he was a ""fair"" or ""poor"" choice.[220]
Ryan formally accepted his nomination at the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 29, 2012.[221] In his acceptance speech, he promoted Mitt Romney as the presidential candidate,[222] supported repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),[222] said that he and Romney had a plan to generate 12 million new jobs over the ensuing four years,[222] and promoted founding principles as a solution: ""We will not duck the tough issueswe will lead. We will not spend four years blaming otherswe will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles.""[222]
The speech was well received by the convention audience and praised for being well-delivered.[223][224] Some fact-checkers noted that there were important factual omissions and that he presented details out of context.[225][226][227][228] Conservative media (including Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post,[229] the Investor's Business Daily,[230] and Fox News[231]) disputed some of the fact-checkers' findings. Politifact.com rated 33 of Ryan's statements which it suspected of being false or misleading as True: 10.5%, Mostly True: 18%, Half True: 21%, Mostly False: 36%, False: 9%, and Pants on Fire: 6%.[232]
On October 11, 2012, Ryan debated his Democratic counterpart, incumbent Vice President Joe Biden, in the only vice presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle.[233][234]
Romney and Ryan lost the 2012 presidential election, but Ryan retained his seat in the House of Representatives.[235][236] Ryan attended the second inauguration of Barack Obama out of what he said was ""obligation"",[237][238][239] where he was booed by a group led by a lawyer with the Voting Section of the Department of Justice.[240][241][242]
In 2014, he published The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea.
Ryan married Janna Little, a tax attorney,[23] in 2000.[243] Little, a native of Oklahoma, is a graduate of Wellesley College, and George Washington University Law School.[23] Her cousin is former Democratic Representative Dan Boren, also of Oklahoma.[244] The Ryans live in the Courthouse Hill Historic District of Janesville, Wisconsin.[20] They have three children: Liza, Charles, and Sam.[245] A Roman Catholic, Ryan is a member of St. John Vianney Catholic Church in Janesville, and was an altar boy.[246][247]
Because of a family history of fatal heart attacks before age 60, Ryan pursues an intense cross-training fitness program called P90X.[248] He is ""fairly careful"" about what he eats[16] and makes his own bratwurst and Polish sausage.[11]
In a radio interview Ryan said that he had run a marathon in under three hours;[249] he later stated that he forgot his actual time and was just trying to state what he thought was a normal time.[250] His one official marathon time is recorded as slightly over four hours.[251][252]
Ryan is a fisherman and bowhunter, and a member of the Janesville Bowmen archery association.[23] He is a fan of the Green Bay Packers.[253] His musical preferences include Beethoven, Rage Against the Machine, and Led Zeppelin, and he reportedly will whisk past reporters, ignoring them, while listening to this music on his iPod.[254][255]

The district is based in the state capital, Madison. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1999 to 2013, representing the 78th district.[1] He represented much of downtown Madison, including the Wisconsin State Capitol. In November 2012, Pocan won the general election to replace Tammy Baldwin, a fellow Democrat and longtime friend who was elected to the U.S. Senate, as the next member of Congress from the district. He had also succeeded Baldwin in the State Assembly.[2]


Pocan was born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He graduated from Harvey Elementary School, Washington Junior High School, and Mary D. Bradford High School in 1982. He attended the University of WisconsinMadison, earning a bachelors degree in journalism in 1986.
Shortly after graduating, Pocan opened up his own small business, a printing company named Budget Signs & Specialties, which he continues to own and run as of 2012. He is a member of the AFL-CIO, which he joined as a small business owner.[3] His active years at UW-Madison in College Democrats led to his election in 1991 to the Dane County Board of Supervisors where he served Madisons downtown community for three terms. He left the board in 1996.
In 1998, Pocan's longtime friend and ally, Tammy Baldwin, gave up her seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly to make a successful run for Congress. Pocan ran to succeed her in the state legislature and won a three-way Democratic primary with 54% of the vote. He faced no Republican opponent in the general election and won with 93% of the vote against an independent. He won re-election in 2000 with 81%--the only time he faced a Republican challenger. He was unopposed for reelection from 2002 to 2010.[4]
After a redistricting by the Republican-controlled legislature, the 78th Assembly District boundaries were changed. Pocan was succeeded in the Assembly by Democrat Brett Hulsey, who had previously represented the 77th District. (As in the 2010 race, the only serious challenge to the Democratic candidate was a Green candidate, Jonathan Dedering; the Republicans did not even field a candidate.)[5]
Pocan identifies as a progressive Democrat, and is a member of a number of organizations, including Wisconsin Citizens Action, the American Civil Liberties Union, Fair Wisconsin[6] and Midwest Progressive Elected Officials Network. He has been an active participant in the ongoing debate regarding same-sex marriage in Wisconsin, though the state has approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Pocan is also one of the few progressive Democrats to have joined the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative-leaning organization that produces model legislative proposals. Pocan used his membership to investigate the organization's agenda and sponsors and wrote a series of articles on his experiences with ALEC for the Madison-based magazine The Progressive.[7][when?] On the September 29, 2012 edition of Moyers and Company, Pocan said ""ALEC is a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests that eventually the relationship culminates with some special interest legislation and hopefully that lives happily ever after as the ALEC model. Unfortunately whats excluded from that equation is the public.""[8]
During his time as a state legislator, Pocan earned a reputation for moving the Wisconsin political debate to the left. One of the most outspoken progressive members of the state assembly, Pocan focused on difficult issues including corrections reform, the state budget, education funding, and fighting privatization schemes.[citation needed]
For six years Pocan sat on the states powerful budget writing Joint Finance Committee, including a term as co-chair. He also took on a leading role among Assembly Democrats, running caucus campaign efforts in 2008 when Dems went from five seats down to successfully retaking the majority for Democrats for the first time in 14 years.
In 2012, Baldwin gave up her congressional seat in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Pocan decided to run in the open 2nd congressional district. He won a four candidate Democratic primary with 72% of the vote. He won all 7 counties in the district, including the heavily populated Dane County with 74% of the vote.[9] The 2nd is so heavily Democratic that Pocan's victory in the primary was widely regarded as tantamount to election.[10] On November 6, 2012, Pocan won the general election, defeating Republican Chad Lee 68%-32%.[11][12]
Pocan is openly gay. He credits his political activism in part to an incident soon after he graduated from college and opened his printing business. Pocan reports that he was followed by two men after he left a gay bar, and was beaten with a baseball bat while they called him ""faggot"" and other slurs. This gaybashing incident spurred him to become active in the Madison LGBT community.[13] Pocan is notable for having been the only openly gay member of the state Assembly after Tammy Baldwin's election to Congress, and was one of three LGBT members of the 100th Wisconsin Legislature,[3] alongside Sen. Tim Carpenter (DMilwaukee), bisexual Rep. JoCasta Zamarripa (DMilwaukee).
On November 24, 2006, Pocan and his long-term partner, Philip Frank, were legally married in Toronto, Ontario.[14]
Mark Pocan's brother William Pocan serves as a circuit court judge in Milwaukee County.[15]
Pocan has received the following recognitions while in office:"

University of Minnesota","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Kind","Ron Kind","Democratic","County Prosecutor","Lutheran - WELS","Ronald James ""Ron"" Kind (born March 16, 1963) is an American lawyer from La Crosse, Wisconsin. Since 1997 he has served as the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district is located in the western portion of the state and is anchored by La Crosse, Eau Claire, Platteville, Stevens Point, Wisconsin Rapids and River Falls.


Kind was born and raised in La Crosse. He is the third of five children born to Greta and Elroy Kind, and belongs to the fifth generation of his family to live in the area.[1] Kind's mother formerly worked as the assistant director of personnel in the La Crosse School District. His father had a 35-year career as a telephone repairman and union leader at the La Crosse Telephone Company.[1]
Kind attended the public schools in La Crosse and became a standout student athlete at Logan High School in both football and basketball. He accepted a scholarship to Harvard College where he graduated with honors in 1985. While attending Harvard, Kind played quarterback on the football team and worked during the summer with Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire in Washington. While working for Proxmire he helped with investigations that helped determine the ""winners"" of the famous Golden Fleece Awards, presented by the senator to those responsible for government waste.[1]
Kind went on to receive a master's degree from the London School of Economics and a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School. He practiced law for two years at the law firm of Quarles and Brady in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Kind returned to his hometown of La Crosse to become a county prosecutor. He later served as a special prosecutor in numerous counties throughout western Wisconsin.[1]
Serving as co-vice chair, Kind is seen as a leader of the centrist New Democratic Coalition. Kind is the Democratic Chief Deputy Whip, and co-founder of both the Upper Mississippi River Congressional Caucus and the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus, and co-vice-chair of the New Democrat Coalition. He voted with his party 87% of the time in the 112th congress and 94% of the time in the 111th congress.[2] Kind's work on the Subcommittee of Health has been focused primarily on health care issues within small business. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, he has worked on an issue of importance to his district, namely the restoration of the Mississippi River; and he has been especially concerned about invasive species that could pose a threat to the river's ecosystem. He also concentrates on the problem of agriculture reform.[3]
On October 10, 2002, Kind voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. [4]
In interest group ratings from his time in office, Kind has supported womens issues, poverty reform, veterans issues, social security, environmental issues, education, and civil rights.[5]
Kind was the lone Wisconsin Democrat to support free trade with China, despite pressure from unions that claimed trade with China is costing jobs.[6][7]
After the failed effort to recall Governor Scott Walker in an April 2012 vote, Kind said that Democrats should be proud of forcing recall elections despite the outcome. He said that his conversations with voters had convinced him that the only reason that Democrats lost was because people didnt think it was a proper use of the recall process.[8]
Kind has been mentioned as a potential candidate for governor or Senator.[9]
Kind wrote the Health Kids Outdoors Act of 2010. This legislation was criticized by conservatives, who expressed concern with the fact that it would track childrens BMIs and that it would tell parents how to raise their children.[10]
He is the House sponsor of the FIT Kids Act, federal legislation that would require school districts to report on students' physical activity and to give youngsters health and nutritional information.[11]
In 2011, Kind wrote a piece about the childhood obesity epidemic, in which he promoted both the FIT Kids Act and the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act. He said that healthy bodies lead to healthy minds, and that his FIT Kids Act would push parents and the public by requiring the states and school districts to report on the childrens physical activity. As for the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act, it provides state-level incentives to develop five-year state strategies to connect children, youth and families with nature and promote outdoor recreation in communities.[12]
Kind has been actively involved in agricultural policy; he was even considered a possible candidate for U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in 2008. While he represents some of the country's most productive dairy farms, he opposes agricultural subsidies.[13] Kind co-sponsored a bill that would have eliminated subsidies for those earning over $250,000 while increasing funding for conservation and rural development. Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to make the original bill accommodating for Democratic interests, was upset with the bill. Agricultural Committee Chairman Collin Peterson said Kind was a lone ranger on this, and hes dividing the caucus, and I dont appreciate it. [14]
Kind was first elected to represent Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district in November 1996. In September 1995, he had announced his intention to run for the 3rd Congressional District seat being vacated by 16-year incumbent Steve Gunderson. Kind later won a five-way race for the Democratic nomination and went on to defeat his Republican opponent, James Harsdorf 52 percent to 48 percent, becoming only the second Democrat to represent this district in the 20th century. Kind didn't face another contest nearly that close until 2010.
In 2004 he won re-election with 57 percent of the vote; in 2006 he defeated Paul R. Nelson and won with 65 percent of the vote.
In 2008 he won with 63 percent of the vote.
He defeated former State Senator Dan Kapanke with 50 percent of the vote.
There was talk that Kind might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012 to replace the retiring Herb Kohl, but he decided not to mount a primary challenge to Tammy Baldwin, who had already announced a senate run.[15] There was also a push to draft Kind to run for governor in 2012 against Scott Walker.[16]
Kind ultimately decided to run for reelection in the 3rd district. He faced retired U.S. Army Col. Ray Boland in the November election and won.[17]
Kind and his wife, Tawni, live in his hometown of La Crosse. She is an official court reporter for the County Court system. They have two sons, Johnny (born in August 1996) and Matthew (born in May 1998). They are members of Immanuel Lutheran Church (Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod).[18]
Kind is a member of the La Crosse Optimists Club, a leader in the Boys and Girls Club, and the La Crosse YMCA. He is also on the board of directors for Coulee Council on Alcohol or Other Drug Abuse. His wife organizes the annual Congressional Art Competition for high school artists in western Wisconsin.[19]"

She is a member of the Democratic Party.
The district is based in Milwaukee and as a result of the 2011 redistricting also includes some nearby Milwaukee County suburbs: Bayside, Brown Deer, Cudahy, Fox Point, Glendale, St. Francis, South Milwaukee, West Milwaukee, Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. She is the first woman to represent the district. She is also the second woman after Tammy Baldwin and the first African-American elected to Congress from Wisconsin.


Moore was born in Racine, but has spent most of her life in Milwaukee. She is the eighth of nine children; her father was a factory worker and her mother a public school teacher. Moore attended North Division High School and served as student council president.[1] She later attended Marquette University and became a single mother and was for a while a welfare recipient. Nonetheless, she was able to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, graduating in 1973.
She worked as an organizer with Volunteers In Service to America.[2] Through the program, she worked to establish the Cream City Community Development Credit Union to offer grants and loans to low-income residents to start businesses. For her work, she was awarded the national VISTA Volunteer of the Decade award from 1976 to 1986.[3] From 1985 to 1989, she worked for the City of Milwaukee as a neighborhood development strategist and for the state Department of Employment Relations and Health and Social Services. Moore also worked for the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) as a housing officer.[1]
In 2000, she received a Certificate for Senior Executives in State and Local Government from Harvard University.
Moore was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1989 and served two terms. She was a prominent voice calling into an investigation into the case of sexual assault and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who lived two blocks away from Moore.[1]
In the election of 1992, Gwen Moore was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, in which she served the 4th District from 1993 to 2005. Moore was the first African-American woman to be elected to the upper chamber of the Wisconsin legislature.[1] She became a prominent voice against mandatory ID security measures to enter the state capitol. She said ""I am too often reminded [9/11 hijacker] Mohammed Atta had a photo ID. This will not tell people whether I am a terrorist. This disenfranchises people who come to their Capitol.""[1]
Moore was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004, earning 69.6% of the vote and defeating Republican attorney Gerald Boyle in the general election. Moore was one of a handful of African-Americans to have been elected to Congress as freshmen in 2004, and she was the first African-American and second woman (after Tammy Baldwin) to represent Wisconsin in Congress.[4]
Moore has become a prominent advocate for womens rights, releasing frequent statements on topics ranging from domestic abuse awareness to abortion rights. In January 2011, she was elected Democratic co-chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus to become a leader on health insurance reform and the protection of reproductive rights.[5] During the congressional debate in February 2011 on the Pence Amendment proposing to defund the health services organization Planned Parenthood, in response to comments from Paul Broun suggesting that Planned Parenthood promoted racist eugenics because more black women than white women have abortions, Moore spoke about her experience raising children on little money, and why ""planned parenthood is healthy for women, its healthy for children and its healthy for our society"".[6] She publicly opposed the investigation into the financial accounting of Planned Parenthood, stating that the investigation is an unfortunate waste of taxpayer dollars.[7] Moore voted nay on Amends Federal Health Care Law to Prohibit Abortion Coverage on October 13, 2011.[8] In March 2012, during the House debate over re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act, she spoke about her own experience of being sexually assaulted and raped as a child and as an adult, criticizing the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that voted no on the bill.[9]
Over the first session of the 109th Congress, Moore earned 90% and higher legislative agenda approval scores from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, and the Service Employees International Union. Moore has focused herself legislatively on traditional Democratic and progressive issues, believing that the federal government should play a significant role in the amelioration of poverty and the resolution of difficult local problems. Moore has received support from interest groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union (93%), The Human Rights Campaign (100%), and The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) (100%), to The National Farmers Union (100%) and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (100%). Moore lacks support from interest groups regarding hunting and sportsmen rights (0% support from Sportsmen and Animal Owners Voting Alliance), pro-life issues (0% support from National Right to Life), and conservative tax reform stances (0% support from Americans for Tax Reform).[10]
During her first term, Moore introduced legislation to provide economic incentives and tax cuts to small businesses to promote job creation, and also cosponsored legislation supporting community block grants, continuing and expanding Medicaid funding, amending the Truth in Lending Act to prevent so-called ""predatory lending,"" and removing troops from Iraq; Moore also cosponsored two prospective amendments to the US Constitution, providing for uniform national election standards and prohibiting gender discrimination under law.
On May 6, 2006, Moore and eight fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus were arrested and ticketed for unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct after they stepped onto the grounds of the Embassy of the Sudan to call attention to the ongoing Darfur conflict in Sudan. Moore said that the group expected ex ante to be arrested but that they were pleased to participate in a ""peaceful act of civil disobedience"".[11]
Moore supports same-sex marriage in the United States.[12]
In June 2014, former state senator and convicted felon Gary George filed nomination papers to run against Moore in the Democratic primary, claiming that he was running ""in response to citizen demands for stronger leadership from Milwaukee's political community.""[13] George lost badly in the August 2014 primary, with 21,234 votes to Moore's 52,380 (69%).[14]
Moore's son, Sowande Ajumoke Omokunde, aged 26, was arrested in connection with the November 2, 2004 (Election Day) tire-slashing of Republican party vehicles in Milwaukee. He was charged with a felony in connection with the event on January 24, 2005, but agreed, on January 20, 2006, to plead no contest in exchange for a sentencing recommendation of restitution and probation.[15] On April 26, 2006, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Michael Brennan sentenced Omokunde to serve four months in prison and to pay $2,305 in fines and restitution. In response, Moore said, ""I love my son very much. I'm very proud of him. He's accepted responsibility.""[16]
Representative Moore has become a U.S. delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.[17]"

University of Wisconsin","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Sensenbrenner","Jim Sensenbrenner","Republican","Wisconsin State Senate","Roman Catholic","Frank James ""Jim"" Sensenbrenner, Jr. (born June 14, 1943) is an American politician who has been a member of the Republican Party in the United States House of Representatives since 1979, representing Wisconsin's 5th congressional district. The district, the state's richest[citation needed], includes many of Milwaukee's northern and western suburbs, and extends into rural Jefferson County. It was numbered as the 9th District until 2003.
He is the former Chairman of the House Science Committee and the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; when the Republicans lost control of the House, he finished his six-year term as Chairman, and was not able to be chosen as the Judiciary Committee's ranking minority member (that honor went to Lamar S. Smith of Texas).[2] He served as the Ranking Republican on the House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming from 2007 to 2011, when Republicans abolished the committee after regaining control of the House.


Sensenbrenner was born in Chicago, Illinois. As one of the heirs to the Kimberly-Clark fortune,[citation needed] he grew up in very comfortable circumstances. He was raised in Shorewood, Wisconsin, and attended the private Milwaukee Country Day School, from which he graduated in 1961. He matriculated at Stanford University, graduating with a B.A. in Political Science in 1965. He received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1968. Sensenbrenner served as staff assistant to California U.S. Congressman J. Arthur Younger and Wisconsin State Senator Jerris Leonard.[3]
Sensenbrenner was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1968, the same year he graduated from law school. He was there until 1975, and in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1975 to early 1979.[4]
When 9th District Congressman Bob Kasten vacated his seat to run for governor in 1978, Sensenbrenner ran in the election to succeed him, defeating his primary opponent, Susan Engeleiter, by 589 votes with a plurality of 43%.[5][6] He was elected in November 1978 with 61%,[7] and has been reelected 16 more times with no substantive opposition, sometimes running unopposed. His district was renumbered as the 5th after the 2000 census, when Wisconsin lost a district. He has never won re-election with less than 62% of the vote. In fact, his worst two re-elections were in 2004, when he defeated UW-Milwaukee professor Bryan Kennedy with 67% of the vote,[8] and in 2006 defeated him in a rematch with 62%.[9]
In 1998, Sensenbrenner was one of the acting House managers in the impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Sensenbrenner introduced the USA PATRIOT Act to the House on October 23, 2001. Although the primary author was Assistant Attorney General of the United States Viet Dinh, Sensenbrenner has been recognized as ""one of the architects of the Patriot Act"".[10] In November 2004, Sensenbrenner and California Congressman Duncan Hunter objected to provisions of a bill that created a Director of National Intelligence, a key recommendation of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 Commission. In 2006, the NRA successfully lobbied Sensenbrenner to add a provision to the Patriot Act re-authorization that requires Senate confirmation of ATF director nominees.[11]
In 2005, Sensenbrenner authored the Real ID Act, which requires scrutiny of citizenship before issuing drivers' licenses to make it more difficult for terrorists and criminals to alter their identities by counterfeiting documents. He attached the controversial act as a rider on military spending bill HR418, which was passed by the Senate without debate.[12]
On June 17, 2005, Sensenbrenner, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, ended a meeting where Republicans and Democrats were debating the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act and walked out in response to Democratic members discussing human rights violations at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and the ongoing Iraq war. He ordered the court reporter to halt transcription of the proceedings and C-SPAN to shut off its cameras. Sensenbrenner defended his actions by stating that the Democrats and witnesses had violated House rules in discussing issues unrelated to the subject of the meeting.[13] Democrats have claimed that his walkout was contrary to House parliamentary procedure, which is to adjourn either on motion or without objection.[14]
In June 2013, Sensenbrenner objected to the FBI and NSA's use of the PATRIOT Act to routinely collect phone metadata from millions of Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing. ""The Bureaus broad application for phone records was made under the so-called business records provision of the Act,"" he said. ""I do not believe the broadly drafted FISA order is consistent with the requirements of the Patriot Act. Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.[15] He released a statement saying While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have always worried about potential abuses.[16][17]
He also criticized the PRISM program, stating that the Patriot Act did not authorize the program.[18][19]
Sensenbrenner supported the Amash Amendment, a plan to defund the NSA's telephone surveillance program. ""Never, he said, did he intend to allow the wholesale vacuuming up of domestic phone records, nor did his legislation envision that data dragnets would go beyond specific targets of terrorism investigations."" The Amendment fell seven votes short of the number it needed to pass.[20][21]
In October 2013, he introduced the USA Freedom Act in the House, a bill designed to curtail the powers of the NSA and end the NSA's dragnet phone data collection program. The bill is supported by civil liberties advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union.[22]
In March 2005, Sensenbrenner sided with the parents and siblings in the Terri Schiavo case, who fought unsuccessfully in federal court to block the withdrawal of her feeding tube.
Sensenbrenner was the main sponsor of H.R. 4437, a bill passed by the House in 2005 that would provide additional criminal penalties for aiding and abetting illegal immigration to the United States.[23]
On September 8, 2005, Sensenbrenner voted against a bill to provide $50 billion in emergency aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina.[24] The bill passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.
On December 16, 2005, Sensenbrenner introduced the Digital Transition Content Security Act. He helped lead the effort to pass the Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2006, which was supported by large copyright holders and opposed by fair use activists.[25]
In 2006, Sensenbrenner expressed outrage at the FBI raid of the congressional office of Democratic Representative William J. Jefferson, asserting constitutional concerns over separation of powers. He held Judiciary Committee hearings in May 2006 on this issue.[citation needed]
In fall 2006, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act unanimously passed the Senate, but Sensenbrenner used his position to block final House consideration of the legislation, even though the bill had 324 co-sponsors. The act creates felony-level penalties for animal fighting activities.[citation needed]
Sensenbrenner was the only Republican to join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Congressional delegation to meet the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India during the March 2008 protests against China by Tibetans.[26] While there he said, ""In the US Congress, there is no division between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of protecting Tibetan culture and eliminating repression against Tibetans around the world.""[27]
Following the death of Nelson Mandela, Sensenbrenner objected to the executive proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower the flags to half-staff to honor Mandela. He stated it was his belief that the American flag should only be flown at half-staff for Americans.[28]
In 2009, Sensenbrenner authored the Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2009.[29]
Sensenbrenner, in spite of unanimous Congressional support,[30] attempted to delay a bill[31] in December 2010 that would have been benefited Hotaru Ferschke, the Japanese-born widow of a United States Marine killed in combat. Congressman John Duncan were able to use ""a loophole"" to get the bill passed in spite of Sensenbrenner's objections. By adding language in the Senate indicating the bill would not impact the federal budget Sensenbrenner could no longer block the bill by himself according to House rules. The measure was passed unanimously.[32]
Sensenbrenner believes in criminal prosecution of broadcasters and cable operators who violate decency standards, in contrast to the FCC regulatory methods.[33] In July 2012, Sensenbrenner advocated amending the Espionage Act of 1917 to enable the prosecution of journalists involved in publishing leaks of state secrets.[34]
In December 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Sensenbrenner referred to First Lady Michelle Obamas big butt while talking to church members at a Christmas bazaar at St. Aidan's church in Hartford.[35] Church member Ann Marsh-Meigs told the newspaper that she heard Sensenbrenners remarks. She said the congressman was speaking about the first ladys efforts to combat childhood obesity, and added, And look at her big butt. On December 22, Sensenbrenners press secretary said Sensenbrenner had sent Obama a personal note and released a statement saying he regretted his inappropriate comment. Sensenbrenners office would not release the text of the note.[36]
Sensenbrenner has received high marks from the National Taxpayers Union, a non-profit organization that supports low taxes.[37]
Sensenbrenner was named the 2006 ""Man of the Year"" by the conservative publication Human Events because of his opposition to open-borders immigration policies.[38] In contrast, in the same year he was rated the second-worst member of the House by Rolling Stone, which dubbed him ""the dictator.""[39] Also in 2006, the NRA lobbied Sensenbrenner to add a provision to the Patriot Act re-authorization that requires Senate confirmation of ATF director nominees.[11]
In 1977, Sensenbrenner married Cheryl Warren, daughter of former state attorney general and U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Warren. The couple have two sons, Frank (born 1981), and Bob (born 1984). Frank worked as a lobbyist for the Canadian embassy in Washington D.C. starting in 2007, although he didn't register with the U.S. as an agent for a foreign government.[40] He is currently a Visiting Fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, his research focusing on Eurozone financial markets, and has blogged for the Huffington Post on Italian politics and the Vatican.[41][42]
When not in Washington D.C., Sensenbrenner resides in Menomonee Falls. He also holds a 25/44th interest in a summer home on Pine Lake in Chenequa, Wisconsin.[43][not in citation given]
Sensenbrenner has a net worth of about $11.6 million.[44] His net worth in 2010 was $9.9 million.[45] He is an heir to the Kimberly-Clark family fortune,[46] but no longer owns any Kimberly-Clark stock.[45] His great-grandfather, Frank J. Sensenbrenner, invented Kotex napkins and served as Kimberly-Clark's second president and CEO, but the congressman has never served on the board or been directly involved with the company.[45] He has put his money into stocks, as detailed in the Congressional Record.[6] Sensenbrenner has also won lottery prizes three times, the largest, $250,000, in 1998.[44][47]
Other notable ancestors of Sensenbrenner's include maternal great-great-grandfather John C. Pritzlaff, founder of Milwaukee-based John Pritzlaff Hardware Company, and paternal great-grandfather James C. Kerwin, a justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. His ancestry includes German, Irish, and Alsatian.[48]
In August 2009, Sensenbrenner announced that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His doctor said the cancer was caught in the early stages when the cure rate is between 85-95 percent.[49]
A former Episcopalian, Sensenbrenner became a Catholic in August 2014.[50]"

In 2004, he challenged State Senate Majority Leader Mary Panzer in the Republican primary. He ran well to Panzer's right, charging that she was insufficiently conservative.[2] He won the nomination in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Panzer's 21 percent.[3] He was unopposed in the general election for this heavily Republican district.[4] From 2007 to 2008, he was the Senate Minority Caucus Chairperson. He has been the assistant Republican leader since 2009, serving as assistant minority leader from 2009 to 2010 and as assistant majority leader since 2011.[1] Grothman is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).
As of 2009, Grothman was the only Republican Wisconsin Senator with a law degree.[5]
Grothman was a vocal proponent of SB11, a controversial bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker in early 2011. He has said he supports the so-called budget repair bill because it is fiscally responsible. In a recent press interview, he said that he did not ""find it impressive"" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.[6]
During the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling ""Shame! Shame!"" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, ""They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd."" He also described the protesters as ""a different breed of person"" and ""a bunch of slobs taking up the building.""[7][8]
During this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: ""Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like."" This was only days before appearing at UWStevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Scott Walker's budget bill.[9]
Grothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures.[10] During the recall, Grothman supporters gathered hundreds of signatures for a giant ""Thank You"" card for Grothman.[11]
On April 3, 2014; Grothman announced he would run in that year's Republican primary for Wisconsin's 6th congressional district against 17-term incumbent Tom Petri. He positioned himself well to Petri's right; in his campaign announcement he called Petri a ""decent, genial person"" who lacked the ""sense of urgency"" to put more curbs on ""a federal government that seems to be out of control.""[12] Grothman did not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; Wisconsin state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and he would not have been up for reelection until 2016. Petri announced shortly after Grothman entered the race that he wouldn't run for reelection, but Grothman remained in the race.
Grothman's longtime home in West Bend was located in the 5th District, represented by fellow Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. However, his state senate district included much of the southeastern portion of the congressional district. In the summer of 2014, Grothman moved to Campellsport, a suburb of Fond du Lac, which is located in the 6th District.[13]
In the general election, Grothman defeated the Democratic nominee, Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, with 57 percent of the vote.
Grothman believes the kindergarten program for 4-year-olds should be defunded by Governor Scott Walker because any academic benefits disappear by the fourth grade, and the program is used by school districts to pad their budgets to get more state aid.[14]
An advocate of Second Amendment rights, Grothman is a long-time supporter of concealed carry legislation, but does not advocate allowing concealed weapons in taverns. He believes concealed carry laws would deter criminal behavior, with permits being awarded to law-abiding citizens who pass a gun safety course.[15]
Grothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which was signed into law by Governor Scott Walker[16] This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.[17]
Speaking in support of Governor Scott Walker's decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman stated that the alleged pay differential is explainable: ""Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears."" [18] However, a study by the American Association of University Women in 2007 found that life choices and family circumstances explain only a portion of the difference in pay between genders. Grothman rejected that study, further claiming, ""You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true.[18]
State Rep. Christine Sinicki accused Grothman of believing ""that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies."" Politifact rated that accusation as False.[19]
He opposed a provision in a 2010 sex education law that prohibited teachers from promoting bias based on sexual orientation, saying that he did not believe the topic should be discussed at all in the public schools. According to the Capitol Times, Grothman's opposition was based on the belief that instructors who lead these talks would have what he called an ""agenda"" to persuade students to become gay.[20] He postulated that ""Part of that agenda which is left unsaid is that some of those who throw it out as an option would like it if more kids became homosexuals.""[20]
Grothman stated that he was concerned about what God might think of the United States after Secretary of State John Kerry announced plans to send scientists to Uganda ""to help them understand homosexuality.""[21] He said Republicans, conservatives, and church leaders were not confronting the issue of homosexuality and were ""losing the issue."" He stated, ""We had such a great country in the relatively recent past. Now America, supposed to be the light of the world, instead were the light going in the opposite direction.[21][22]
Grothman claimed, in a December 2012 press release, that Kwanzaa is not a real holiday. He claimed, ""Of course, almost no black people today care about Kwanzaa - just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people's throats in an effort to divide Americans.""[23]
He released a statement opposing a Kwanzaa holiday, stating that we should ""treat Kwanzaa with the contempt it deserves before it becomes a permanent part of our culture.""[24]
Grothman has argued that Martin Luther King, Jr. Day should not be a state employee holiday, calling the day off ""an insult to all the other taxpayers around the state."" He has expressed doubts that ""state workers would be 'checking out DVDs or reading books' about King and would probably just be out shopping or watching television instead.""[25]
He was a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 19 (2011), which removes the requirement of mandatory chlorination of groundwater in municipal water systems.[26][27] This bill was supported by the League of Wisconsin Municipalities which argued that it was unnecessary and expensive.[28]
Grothman is a vocal supporter of decriminalizing raw milk sales.[29][30]
In February 2012, Grothman introduced Senate Bill 507, which would amend Wisconsin statutes to emphasize single parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect.[31] Politifact investigated his claim that kids living with a parent and parent's partner are ""20 times"" more likely to be sexually abused, and rated it True.[32] Grothman claimed that modern women were choosing to have children out of wedlock and ""we should educate women that this is a mistake.""[33]
He also sponsored State Bill 202, which would have repealed the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that the ""Left and the social welfare establishment want children born out of wedlock because they are far more likely to be dependent on the government.""[34]
Grothman opposed a bill that would increase funding for anti-smoking programs from $10 to $30 million. He believes that anti-smoking campaigns do not work, and are no longer necessary, writing ""Everybody knows you're not supposed to smoke!.""[35] He also voted against the ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other small business that became effective in July 2010.[36] After the bill was passed, he introduced new legislation to allow guests to smoke in hotel rooms.[citation needed]. He also co-sponsored a bill to exempt electronic cigarettes from the smoking ban.[37]
In June 2013, Grothman advocated for reforming welfare in Wisconsin. He advocated requiring nondisabled single adults to either work twenty hours per week, or attend twenty hours of job training per week to continue receiving FoodShare benefits.[38]
Grothman has never been married and has no children.[34]

He first entered public life as a cast member on The Real World: Boston and 2002's Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons, before going on to serve as district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin and the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 7th congressional district. He is a member of the Republican Party.


Sean Patrick Duffy was born in Hayward, Wisconsin,[2][3][4] on October 3, 1971, the tenth of 11 children of Carol Ann (ne Yackel) and Thomas Walter Duffy. He is of Irish, English, German, and Norwegian descent.[5] Duffy has a marketing degree from St. Mary's University, and a law degree from William Mitchell College of Law.[6]
Duffy started log rolling at age five and speed climbing (sprinting up 60 and 90 foot poles) at 13. He holds two speed-climbing titles.[7]
Duffy has been an ESPN color commentator for televised competitions and in 2003 appeared as both a competitor and commentator on ESPN's Great Outdoor Games. He was named Badger State Games Honorary Athlete of the 2004 Winter Games.[6]
In 1997, Duffy appeared on The Real World: Boston, the sixth season of the MTV reality television show, and on Road Rules: All Stars in 1998, where he met his future wife Rachel. Duffy later appeared on Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons, which aired in 2002. Both appeared in a filmed segment on 2008's The Real World Awards Bash, while Duffy served as district attorney.[8]
Duffy, a Republican,[9] was appointed to the district attorney's post in 2002[10] by then Governor Scott McCallum, and was elected unopposed in 2002,[10] 2004,[11] 2006[12] and 2008. Upon assuming the office of district attorney, he succeeded Michael Gableman, a current justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Duffy was on the Republican slate of the 10 Wisconsin electors for the 2008 Presidential Election.[13]
On July 8, 2009, Duffy announced his campaign for Congress in Wisconsin's seventh congressional district. Duffy was considered an underdog in the race until May 2010 when 15-term incumbent Democrat Representative Dave Obey announced that he would not seek re-election.[14] Following Obey's announcement, Democratic State Senator Julie Lassa joined the race.
On June 4, 2010, Duffy announced his resignation from the position of District Attorney of Ashland County to focus on the congressional race. The resignation was effective three weeks later and Duffy returned to work in his father's law practice.[15]
He won the race on November 2, 2010, in a nationwide wave of Republicans being elected to Congress.[16] Different sources attribute his victory to his ten month head start on Lassa's campaign, his grassroots organization and fundraising, his experience as a district attorney, and voter discontent with the economy.[17]
Duffy was challenged by Democratic nominee Pat Kreitlow.
Duffy was challenged by Democratic nominee Kelly Westlund.
Duffy voted to eliminate Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements for federal projects.[18][19][20] The first piece of legislation he sponsored was the RESET Act, which called for using unspent money in Obama's economic stimulus plan to pay down the debt. The idea was later incorporated into a spending bill. He also introduced a resolution to ban earmarks. One of his sponsored legislation, to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, passed the U.S. House but hasn't passed the U.S. Senate.[20] The bill created a bipartisan commission made up of five members of Congress to replace the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director. The bill also gave the committee more room to get rid of polices that Duffy believes jeopardize the safety of the US banking system.[21]
In March 2011, Duffy caused controversy when a video published by the Polk County Republicans, showing a public town hall-style meeting in his district, was removed after critics attacked the video. In the video, made in the wake of the passage of a controversial state bill which would have effectively frozen the salaries of state employees, Duffy was asked about whether he would be willing to cut his own $174,000 salary. Duffy responded that he would only be willing to do so as part of a general round of salary cuts for government employees, and insisted that he was ""struggling"" to get by, despite his salary being nearly three times the average for Wisconsin residents.[22] The video has since been published in other locations.[23][24][25][26][27]
On December 22, 2011, Duffy and fellow GOP House freshman Rick Crawford (Arkansas), published an open letter to Speaker Boehner, urging the leader to allow the House to vote on the Senate's 2-month tax cut extension compromise.[28]
In 2013, Duffy and Democrat House member Michael Michaud (Maine) introduced a resolution calling for government action to ensure that people be provided with paper-based information along with electronic.[29]
Duffy introduced the Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3448; 113th Congress) on November 12, 2013.[30] The bill is intended to increase the liquidity on the stock market of stocks belonging to emerging growth companies.[31] It would allow small companies to choose a tick size of $0.05 or $0.10 instead of the standard $0.01.[31][32] To participate, companies would need to have stock prices of over $1.00 and revenues of less than $750 million.[33]
Duffy introduced the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 3193; 113th Congress) on September 26, 2013.[34] It is a bill that would restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by transforming it into a five person commission and removing it from the Federal Reserve System.[35] The CFPB would be renamed the ""Financial Product Safety Commission."" This bill is also intended to make overturning the decisions about regulations that the new commission makes easier to do.[35]
Duffy serves on the Committee on Financial Services, in particular the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity.[36]
Duffy is married to Rachel Campos-Duffy, an alumna of The Real World: San Francisco.[37][38][39] They once lived in Ashland, Wisconsin.[40][41] They moved to Weston, Wisconsin in late 2011,[42] and in 2013 they moved to Wausau, Wisconsin so that Duffy could be closer to an airport for his weekly commute to Washington, D.C., where he spends three or four days a week.[43]
They have seven children: Evita Pilar, Xavier Jack, Lucia-Belen, John-Paul, Paloma Pilar, MariaVictoria Margarita, and Margarita Pilar. [44] [45]"

He is a member of the Republican Party.


Ribble is a third generation Wisconsin resident. He was born in Neenah, Wisconsin. He graduated from Appleton East High School. After high school, he attended Grand Rapids School of Bible and Music to become a full-time minister. However, he eventually decided to continue his father's small business instead.[2]
Ribble defeated two other candidates to win the Republican primary in September.[3] Ribble defeated Democratic incumbent Steve Kagen for Wisconsin's 8th congressional district on November 2, 2010 in the general election.[4]
Ribble defeated Democratic nominee Jamie Wall, a business consultant.
Congressman Ribble believes that we should utilize the wide variety of available domestic sources to put our country on a path to energy independence.[5] To become self-sufficient, Ribble wants to expand the usage of both renewable and fossil fuels, so that the U.S. will not rely too much on any single source or foreign region.[5][6] In June 2012, he voted for the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act, which would increase oil and gas drilling in the U.S., and decrease environmental restrictions.[7] In addition, Ribble also supported the Offshore Leasing Act in May 2011, and required the Secretary of the Interior to conduct offshore oil and gas lease sales.[8]
Coming from a state with a great economic emphasis on agriculture, Ribble advocates for continued success in the farming sector of Wisconsin. He favors less government regulation on farming, and wants to reform several Environmental Protection Agency restrictions, believing that Wisconsins dairy farmers, livestock producers, and growers all stand to benefit from efforts to roll back EPAs overreach.[9] He is a vocal member of the House Agriculture Committee,[10] and has received a rating of 94% from the American Farm Bureau Federation as of 2011.[11]
Ribble strongly disagrees with the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.[12] In July 2012, he voted for the Repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010,[13] stating that instead of fixing the systematic flaws in our countrys healthcare system it makes it even more costly and dysfunctional.[14] He believes instead, that government should not be involved in the market and encourage greater competition between insurance companies.[15]
In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner dated October 8, 2013, Ribble proposed sweeping changes to Social Security, including continuing and accelerating increases in the retirement age, implementing the chained CPI benefit cut to Social Security, and means testing for Social Security recipients. Though claiming that these changes were necessary to ""save and secure this vital, popular program"", Ribble's letter also proposed cutting the FICA withholding rate and reducing the cap on wages that are used to fund the Social Security Trust Fund which would reduce revenues for the Fund.[16]

On September 20, 2013, the House passed a bipartisan measure championed by Ribble. The measure, titled the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act, aims to manage commercial timberland and the yields each field can produce. Backers of the bill say that the bill would foster job growth in rural communities where the paper industry is prevalent, such as the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin.[18]"

She is a member of the Republican Party. She previously served as a State Representative (197983, 198593), State Senator (199395), and State Treasurer (19992007).


Lummis is one of four children born in Cheyenne to Doran Lummis and the former Enid Bennett (1928-2013), a native of Denver, Colorado, who was reared in Cheyenne and was highly active in Cheyenne Frontier Days and the Republican Party. Lummis' maternal grandparents were Clarence ""Buck"" Bennett, the head mechanic at the Greyhound Bus Lines in Cheyenne, and Eda Erickson Bennett. Her siblings are Christine, Claudia, and Dell and his wife Sally Lummis, all of Cheyenne. In a statement upon her mother's death, Lummis said, ""I carry with me so many lessons my mother taught me; chief among them is the quiet grit she displayed in the face of pain and adversity.""[1]
Lummis was educated at Trinity Lutheran School and public schools in Cheyenne. She graduated from Cheyenne East High School in 1972. She was active in the 4-H Club and raised Hereford calves every year for showing at the annual county fair in August.[citation needed]
After high school, Lummis enrolled in the University of Wyoming in Laramie, the state's only four-year institution of higher learning.[citation needed] She obtained two Bachelor of Science degrees in animal science in 1976 and in biology in 1978.[2] While she was a legislator, she received her Juris Doctor degree in 1985 and also clerked for the Wyoming Supreme Court.[3]
Lummis was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1983 and 1985 to 1993, and then the Wyoming Senate from 1993 to 1995. At twenty-four, she was the youngest woman to have been elected to the Wyoming House. Lummis concentrated on issues of taxation and natural resources.[citation needed]

Meyer, previously the Wyoming Secretary of State.[citation needed]
On June 14, 2007, Lummis was among thirty-one Wyoming Republicans to file their names with the Republican State Central Committee in Cheyenne for consideration as the successor to U.S. Senator Craig Thomas,[citation needed] who died earlier in the month.[citation needed] She was chosen as one of the three nominees by the committee submitted to Governor Dave Freudenthal for final selection[citation needed] who, under Wyoming law, made the final selection on June 22, 2007, to appoint John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and State Senator from Casper.[citation needed] Lummis had considered challenging Barrasso in the 2008 special election to complete the remaining four years of Thomas's term, but instead announced her candidacy for the open seat that was vacated by Barbara Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives.[citation needed]
Cynthia Lummis is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a ""congressman""; the others are Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black of Tennessee.[4]

Lummis, who carried the support of pro-life and economic conservative voters in Wyoming, won the November 4, 2008, general election to succeed Barbara Cubin of Casper. In the August primary election, Lummis defeated businessman and rancher Mark Gordon of Buffalo in Johnson County, who outspent her four-to-one, along with other candidates Bill Winney and Michael S. Holland.[citation needed] Gordon is now the Wyoming state treasurer.
In the general election, Lummis faced Democratic Teton County School Board Trustee Gary Trauner of Wilson, who had run against Cubin in 2006 and nearly won.[6] Trauner criticized Lummis because she has supported privatization of Social Security and has also suggested raising the retirement age for receiving such benefits; Trauner has called instead for consideration of imposing the FICA tax on income over $100,000, which is currently exempt.[7] Lummis defeated Trauner by 10 percentage points.[citation needed]
Lummis won re-election with 71% against Democratic challenger David Wendt.[8]
Lummis again won re-election with 69% of the vote against Democratic challenger Chris Henrichsen.
In October 2013, Jason Adam Senteney (born 1978), a resident of Yoder and a corrections officer at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington, announced that he will challenge Lummis in the 2014 Republican primary. Senteney attended West Texas A&M University in Canyon, Texas, but did not graduate. He opposed the 2013 government shutdown: ""You should never shut down essential programs for people. ... Whether it's a negotiation tactic or not, you shouldn't punish the American people for your own failure to work together in Washington.""[9]
No other candidate has yet entered the 2014 congressional primary.
Timothy P. Carney of the Washington Examiner has called Lummis one of Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake's ""posse of anti-appropriators"" on the Approrpriations Committee.[10] According to Carney, Lummis ""is the league leader in bucking the committee leadership.""[10] She is a member of the Republican Study Committee.[citation needed]

Lummis appeared on The Colbert Report on March 9, 2009, as part of the show's recurring Better Know a District segment, which often lampoons members of the U.S. Congress. The segment dealt with cougars, or mountain lions, with Colbert asking if Wyoming had a cougar problem, while alluding to the slang use of the term ""cougar"".[citation needed]
In 2008, Lummis reported her wealth as ranging from $20 million to $75 million. In 2010, she reported $5.5 million and $24 million each. She ranked in 2010 as the twenty-ninth wealthiest member of Congress.[citation needed] Most of Lummis wealth is derived from her family-owned Arp and Hammond Company, Lummis Livestock Company, and Old Horse Pasture Inc.[27]"
